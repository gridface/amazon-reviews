ADWH2E3TYI0Q1,B00CLF83J2,4.0,"while PT and PTB have continued to make a lot of music since his/there glory days, the vast majority of those releases would have to be classified as for fans -- and sometimes, just his most hardcore fans -- only.CAN DO breaks that chain, in a big way.  this is a very well-produced rock and roll album.  PT's guitar chops are on display, but in a way that's a little more mainstream and little less smoky bar brash.  his band sounds excellent, in particular his rhythm section.while occasionally cliche, PT's lyrics this time around express the feelings of someone who's experienced the abundance of life (the good and the not-so-good). he acknowledges the trajectory of his own career in a way that feels 100% real, even if he's not 100% happy about it.like the grizzled veteran lawyer in paul newman's The Verdict thirty years ago, Can Do proves he really still &#34;can do&#34; a fantastic album from start to finish -- except the excruciatingly painful remake of eurhythmics Here Comes The Rain.congratulations Pat Travers and band. if there is a tour supporting this record, don't miss it. &#34;****&#34;"
AXXTANF6EECIZ,B00CLF8400,4.0,"Matt Nathanson continues his library here with another inspired effort.  Love the tales of life in the Bay area, from the Girl in the Kink's Shirt to Earthquake Weather.  Matt's sound is as compelling as ever, he is energetic and engaging.  Found it interesting that there were 8 different composers credited on this album, amazing it comes together as seamlessly as it does.  Only mild complaint is that the length is somewhat short, 11 songs averaging under 4 minutes.  Would be nice to see Matt stretch a couple out as he does so well in concert.  On that note, if you ever get a chance to see Matt live, by all means go.  He's witty as the dickens, loves the audience, and puts on a hell of a show.  Can't wait to see him in St Louis 11/20/2013.  After attending the concert, love the album more than ever and some of the back stories on the songs are hilarious.  \"Girl In The Kinks' Shirt\" was a waitress the entire band was enamored with at a local SF diner. They changed the name of the band on her favorite shirt, thinking she'd never find out the song was about her, then a USA Today columnist who interviewed Matt went to the diner and asked the waitress how she liked the song......"
A2RSQCZ1TF1ZX0,B00CLF84BE,4.0,"This CD is like the soundtrack to some inspiring 80's movie where the protagonist overcomes the odds to win some race or the hand of a girl with big hair.  All of his music sounds like it is from 1987, but I mean that in a good way.  I have all the House of Lords CDs and this fits right in. I'll keep buying his CDs as long as he keeps recording new ones."
A74X2DM3XX7CG,B00CLOH240,4.0,"I was torn between giving this a 5 star or 4 star rating but i settled for 4 stars because I feel Kings of Leon's Mechanical bull was the best Rock album released in 2013. That said this a a great release especially a debut album very strong!Its different I cant compare there sound to anything else I listen to. British accents paired with punk rock looks and hair that is well also different. The music is really good there are lots of hit singles on this album Chocolate, Sex, the City, Girls, Settle down, and Robbers. But I know other song on the album could easily be a hit single. Start to finish this an album you can listen to with out skipping tracks granted there maybe some songs you repeat over and over again. The music is very catchy and synth pop oriented. I grabbed this part from a site because perfectly describes this albums style. &#34;Lyrically, The 1975 explore themes of discovery and novelty in the more specific context of sex, love, drugs, hope, death, and fear.&#34; This is just really good indie rock!"
A3ZHTOIZ3XPJK,B00CLUMEC4,5.0,Alabama is timeless and is always a great group to pisten to...young and old. This set is awesome and gets cranked up in my car.
A2CFLHF3I4JK61,B00CLUMEC4,5.0,This is agreat collection of albums. Alabama is my favorite country band and this collection shows why they are gfreat.
A673HB9RWN8JZ,B00CLVF2AO,5.0,"As a long-time subscriber at Houston Grand Opera, I've had the privilege of following Joyce DiDonato from her days as a Studio member to her present status as international superstar. I have heard her in Little Women, Resurrection, Barber of Seville, Cenerentola, Maria Stuarda, La Donna del Lago, and was fortunate to hear her in Dead Man Walking at a Sunday matinee that was Frederica Von Stade's farewell operatic performance. She has it all-- the technique, the stage presence, the vocal beauty, the perfect timing, but most importantly the ability to communicate. This collection will be treasured by her fans, but hopefully will also introduce her to many others. Her ability to shine in music from Handel to Heggie and her generosity as an artist--this is what makes her a superstar, and it is a thrill watching her career grow and hearing an amazing singer in her prime."
AP7UEUF6W98AW,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"this album is fantastic. i have been anxiously awaiting this since... well, promised land, frankly... i am a queensryche fan because of empire.(late to the game i know) heck, i became a (wannabe) audiophile because of empire. a good friend of mine turned me onto it back in the day swearing it would change the way i listen to music and he was right. to this day empire and promised land are two cd's i use as reference... (i actually really like hear in the now frontier, yes it's different and it took some getting used to, but i eventually just grew to appreciate it's progressive quality... but since then every album has been a major struggle to enjoy. the last one i actually liked some of quite a bit but i digress...)but FINALLY a queensryche album to cheer about!! my second favorite album of the year behind steven wilson's 'raven that refused to sing' which is itself a sonic masterpiece, having no dynamic  compression at all apparently. it made me ask 'why do we NEED mastering'? i have to wonder if guys like jimbo barton get frustrated after putting their expertise to a project, only to have some other dope wreck their work! this doesn't sound nearly as bad as the cd released this year by some other band calling themselves queensryche, but COME ON!i'd pay to buy this album again at a premium if someone would release a remaster... shoot. with scott rockenfield's penchant for creating sonic landscapes i'm surprised there's not a dvd-a 5.1 mix!  this album deserved to be a reference album!well done, (the REAL) QUEENSRYCHE! well done jimbo barton! tom baker...shame on you"
A1URYPVG5DLLZZ,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"From X2 to the end, the way it starts, the feeling, the depth, everything. This sounds like the Real Deal.Geoff Tate took the spirit, the feeling of the band and most importantly the fans.The 3 original members decided to fire him, yet he doesn't accept it and he still can't be classy about it. He made a quick album with no depth and remade the old classics horribly for what? All he gained was the hatred of the old fans.Now Todd is a classy, great guy, who fits with the name Queensryche. Just listen to \"A World Without\" you will know what I mean, it's just like Promised land.Buy it and support the real deal."
A35O6WBIAUKTGE,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,Can't stop listening to this album. There are nine heavy metal anthems and two instrumental pieces. Great to see my heroes return. Who else could create songs like Open Road or In this light? I missed those type of songs for years. Can't wait for the next album. It's just the beginning of a new era for the band. From: a brazilian fan.
A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"I admit, I have a hard time accepting when members of a band are replaced. Often, the chemistry is just not the same. The parting members are usually extremely talented and key to what makes a band who they are.But then there are times where the person coming in is like a new friend or lover, who replaced the one who changed so much you're not certain who they are anymore. In the case of Geoff Tate, it's like watching the person who was the poetry loving girlfriend who prided herself on her intelligence and moral character cheat on you with some crackhead.Now, I don't think either side is being quite honest about what went wrong and who's to blame. Each claims they wrote all the music, except for that which sucked, of course. And it's hard to believe the QR camp thinks it's entirely Geoff Tate's fault when Rockenfield is saying he wants to play with Lady Gaga. I'm not hating on Gaga, just stating that it's more than Geoff who had non prog metal tastes.But when Todd La Torre comes into my life and brings back those feelings I got from the early days of Queensryche, I'm left feeling a little guilty. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against change and I'm not one of those people who thought everything post Empire (or whichever album you think QR started sucking at was)was a waste of time.Still, more recent releases have lacked the poetry of earlier QueensRyche, both lyrically and musically. I don't think I've heard guitar solos as beautiful as what I hear from Michael and Parker on this disc. Scott's drums are amazing and Eddie's bass playing is spectacular.But what elevates the disc is Todd's singing. Yes, it's clear he's here to do his best Tate impression, which is a little weird at times. But you can also hear his own identity, and what he does is incredible.I have personal favorites, such as Redemption, In this Light and Open Road. But the whole disc is amazing. In fact, this is the disc everyone wanted Queensryche to make.Everyone, that is, except Geoff Tate.If you listen to both his solo release and his version of QR, you can still here his genius. The solo disc especially, makes you wish things were back how they were, and that he wasn't trying to be gangsta in places. Yes, change is good, but not when you sink to that low a level.In the meantime, I'll be plagued with guilt every time I listen to this CD, all while loving every minute of it."
A3G53OSKOX59AM,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"I have been a Queensryche fan since the early 80's (The Warning) (Rage For Order) . But when Operation Mind Crime came out it became one of my top 5 albums of all time. I love good music and it is hard to have a favorite # 1.  This new CD is simply awesome. It sounds a lot like there classic stuff and also an Empire sound to it. But at the same time it does not sound dated at all. The new lead singer sounds great. And lets face it Geoff Tate's vocals have gone down hill now for a while. And his solo stuff oooouch, not so great.I just hope this new CD is the first of many great things to come from this awesome band. Even a live CD would be very cool.So I gave this great CD a much deserved 5 star rating. So if you are reading this and have not yet purchased the new Queensryhe....... buy it!Dano"
A2YKU5ZJSDLREO,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"Hate to jump on the Geoff Tate hate band wagon, but this is much better than his version of queensryche. Sort of reminded of a updated metal version of Empire with a touch of operation mind crime or rage of order very cool! The lead singer is amazing I really can't tell him or Geoff Tate apart which is a good thing. Very cool album, definitely going to have repeat listens. Cant wait to see what they do next. The new singer has put much needed energy into the band!"
A2RU345NAZ6KL5,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"Some may say that with this album Queensryche are trying to duplicate their past glories, attempting to recapture their sound from 25 years ago - as if it were some sort of pejorative.  On the contrary, that is what the majority of their fans have been missing over the past couple of decades.  The mediocre midtempo dad-rock foisted upon the fans during the Tate-led Queensryche era resulted in ever-decreasing album and ticket sales over time.Thankfully, this album *is* a return to form for Queensryche. The \"signature sound\" is in full effect here.  Harmony leads are back in abundance.  Soaring operatic vocals courtesy new vocalist Todd La Torre.  The rhythm section is in prime form, charging through the songs as if their lives depended on it.I won't do a track-by-track breakdown, but this album would fit comfortably in the Rage for Order - Promised Land timeline. There's a couple of tracks that are on the average side, but by and large the songs are top notch.  The claim that Rockenfield, Jackson, and Wilton were incapable of bringing anything to the songwriting table is proven on this album to be hollow and without merit.Some criticisms have been leveled at Todd La Torre for being a Tate clone.  He has said all along that Tate was one of his primary influences.  And he's being backed by 3/4 of the original musicians.  So it's not a huge surprise that yeah, at times he sounds like Tate - though Tate from 20 years ago (which is a far cry from the shell of a vocalist he has become after years of smoking and drinking).  This is not a bad thing - do people really want another Blaze Bayley that can't do the classic material justice?  But La Torre is by no means aping Tate's mannerisms throughout.  He brings his own style to the table, and it's a welcome change from the nasally vocals that defined QR's output over the past decade.Now for criticisms.  The album is too short - some of my favorite QR songs in the past were the longer, more epic tracks like Suite Sister Mary and Roads to Madness.  Nothing here clocks in over 4 minutes and change.  On more than one occasion a song ends just as it is really getting going.  I realize there is wisdom in leaving the audience wanting more, but at the same time it almost feels artificially short.  And the \"brick wall\" mastering is overwhelming at times - though sadly very very few bands have any say in the mastering process.But overall, this is the album I was hoping Queensryche would put out ever since my disappointment with Hear in the Now Frontier.  Finally, after 15+ years of waiting and hoping, they have delivered."
AJGDQWXZ3VPAI,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"** After several listens, I could clearly hear the clipping and static that some others have mentioned. It doesn't ruin the album but it does subtract from what is otherwise a near perfect album. I changed my rating to 4 stars.**Wow.Here's the most important part of this review... Even if this CD were made by some random band that I had never heard of, after the first listen I would be wondering \"who is this? This kicks ass!\"With all of the crazy stuff that's been going on with Queensryche over the past year or so, you would expect them to put out some rushed, half assed collection of songs that had either been sitting on the shelf or written by outside writers. But instead, somehow inbetween shows, they went into the studio and got to work creating not only their best CD in years but one of their best CDs EVER.The unexpected thing about these songs is that although they don't sound like rip offs of older songs, they sound almost like new companion pieces to other albums. Certain songs have a darkness to them that are clear reminders of Promised Land. Other sections are very reminiscent of Rage For Order (and I don't say that lightly... RFO is a masterpiece of atmosphere and complexity.) \"In This Light\" has the catchiest chorus of anything since Empire, it grabbed me the first time that I heard the teaser for this album. But there's a sense of urgency to \"Fallout\" and \"Don't Look Back\" that although may remind some of very early Queensryche, it also sounds like something from a completely new band. I don't know what to compare \"Vindication\" to, but it's a high point of the album. That bass line jumps at you and the angelic chorus is the perfect counterpoint to the relentless heaviness of the song.If you haven't heard the streamed version of this album, well... where have you been? The band was cool enough to invite you to hear the whole damn thing for FREE. But even then, I thought that every song was fantastic... EXCEPT the first teaser track \"Redemption.\" The chorus is perfect but the bridge is just clumsy and slows down the whole momentum of the song. I thought that the song was okay until I heard the rest of the CD. Everything else here is MUCH better.Two things that surprised me. First, the lyrics are very well written (isn't that supposed to be why they needed Geoff so much?)  At first listen \"A World Without\" just sounds like a moody dark track, but when you read the lyrics you begin to understand the powerful subject matter. They don't dumb it down, you have to put together the pieces and visualize each line before it becomes clear. Once you do, \"Midnight Lullaby\" isn't just an interlude, it's a necessary introduction to the story that you're about to hear. Secondly, Scott has become a MONSTER drummer. He's always been great, but there are so many flourishes and fills here and there that truly take every song to another level. It's not to the point that it gets in the way of the other instruments, it's just enough to make you say \"Holy crap, how many hands does this guy have??\"As for Todd, I'll admit, when I saw the first You Tube videos of his performances, I wasn't blown away. I mean let's face it, vintage Geoff Tate is a hard act to follow. But then I saw a quote from Michael Sweet, basically vouching for Todd's vocal abilities. If the voice of Stryper is impressed, then I had to have an open mind. Todd shines on this CD. On certain songs he sounds amazingly close to Geoff Tate (the chorus of \"Don't Look Back\" sounds like American Soldier era Tate), but on other tracks, he most definitely brings something else to the table. He sounds better ever time that I hear him. And the fact that he writes lyrics, and they are better than the crap that Tate has been spewing out lately, is just icing on the cake. He's a good fit for the band.Speaking of song writing, there's one last thing that needs to be addressed. Ever since Tate was kicked out of this band, there's been an ongoing controversy about who had written the classic Queensryche songs. Everyone knows that Chris Degarmo was a major piece that will forever be missed, but for anyone that's doubting the input of Michael, Ed and Scott, here's an excerpt from the November 1990 issue of Guitar World magazine. Chris DeGarmo is discussing the origin of the song \"Resistance\" from Empire:\"Michael had a real cool, aggressive piece of music. He played this thing for me and I helped arrange it... It only took a second for Scott 'One Take' Rockenfield to blaze off his track.... We communicate very thoroughly on song ideas before we record them.\"Queensryche is a band. When you read the song writing credits in the liner notes, that's mainly the people that are responsible for the lyrics and melody. If you think that Geoff Tate was writing Scott's drum parts on Mindcrime, listen to the drums on Tate's \"F.U\" album verses the drums on this CD. Then listen to the bass lines. Then listen to the guitars. There's a reason why Tate recently stated that he doesn't \"know what the Queensryche signature sound is.\"Mister Tate, THIS is the signature Queensryche sound. It's a damn shame that you couldn't be a part of it. But I think that the rest of the band just reassured us that we'll be fine without you."
A1WJWKSDV2FAAB,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"Queensryche is back with a vengeance on this new release without original vocalist Geoff Tate. The band is seemingly trying to get back to the glory days and have an excellent sound very reminiscent of the 80's and early 90's. In my opinion, this is a breath of fresh air and shows their is life, talent, and good songwriting without Tate (never thought I would say that). The band seems to enjoy playing and being together again, which even makes them fun to listen to again. It's hard at this time to list favorite songs, since after 4 listenings I still like them all. If you're an old fan you will love it, unless you are more of a Tate fan. 9 out of 10 of my friends prefer this over the Tate release. Listen to the samples and make your choice."
AAL3F8EW8DUHQ,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"Man i couldn't wait to run out and buy this Album as soon as it was released. This is the most excited i have been about going out and purchasing an Album since Symphony X,s Iconoclast Album that came out 2 years ago.This is a true Reinvigeration of the band. This is classic Queensryche right here. The songs on here are Powerful, Dynamic, And Intense. This is the Queensryche that you grew up with, This is the Queensryche that you love. And the band is making a statement on this Record saying we are back and thanks for being patient with us.The Album itself is short in length. it clocks in at around 35 Minutes, But the songs are Excellent and the flow is Superb.Standout tracks on here are Where Dreams go to Die, Redemption, And Fallout.Queensryche are back. Thank God. This is a Fantastic Album."
A1BPZI5LWM1T7R,B00CM9JIZ0,5.0,"Great music by Queensryche,As you may or may not know there are 2 bands called Queensryche or something that looks like the very same,Not going to get into the personal aspects of the reason but Both bands are at the top of My chart.So dont flame either band,Embrace the great music!"
A2991AJVD21VLN,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"Have you asked yourself what the hell has happened to queensryche in the last 10 or more years?This record should answer that......it was Geoff! They get rid of him, put out a great record, that should answer all your questions about there feud. Oh, and guess what.....IT SOUNDS LIKE QUEENSRYCHE!How many years has it been since you've been able to say that?Hats off to Wilton, Jackson, Rockenfield, and La Torre,....#23 on the Billboard top 200 .........with out Geoff. LOL!!!"
AN8WCREEAS932,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"I saw that Todd Latorre joined Queensryche after a weird messy break-up with Geoff Tate.  Tate has his own Q'ryche and then there's this version, the Todd Latorre fronted Queensryche.  All that mess aside, the Latorre version of Queensryche kicks ass!  It has a great older feel to it but the songs are new and fresh.  The band sound rejuvenated and cleaner than they have on albums in years.  For fans of the band, stick with the Latorre front version as the Tate version has taken the train to crazy town.  For actual Queensryche music this is the album to hear, good stuff all around."
A1R6A4KEUXV3JD,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"Queensryche - Self TitledWritten by The Rock ManOver the course of the past several years, opinions between some sections of the media, music journalists and fans have been divided over the quality of work produced by progressive metal icons Queensryche. Their past two studio recordings American Soldier (2009) and Dedicated To Chaos (2011) have taken quite a beating by some. I for one a fan of both. Given the recent turmoil in the band causing the departure of vocalist Geoff Tate and his own release of a Queensryche album, Frequency Unknown, the world has waited patiently for \"The Original Queensryche\" to respond with a release of its own. Well rock fans here it is.The three remaining original members, Michael Wilton - lead guitar, Eddie Jackson - bass and Scott Rockenfield - drums have joined with Crimson Glory vocalist Todd La Torre and Sledgeback guitarist Parker Lundgren to record a new album simply titled Queensryche. And what an album it is. In its time the band have acquired a massive armoury of quality material and Queensryche can stand proudly along side all of them.A strong feature of any Queensryche album is the bass playing from Eddie Jackson and on this latest recording that feature continues. Scott Rockenfield continues to push the boundaries of his playing with a bold, innovative style and on this record sounds refreshed and full of enthusiasm. Michael Wilton, as always, displays his ability as a master axe man with amazing melodies and technique and on Queensryche raises the bar of his own standards.Vocally Todd La Torre puts in an outstanding performance on his first Queensryche outing, sounding very much like the man he replaced, Geoff Tate and at times Nils K. Rue from Pagan's Mind. I know these thoughts will upset all the Geoff Tate haters who are circling for his blood, but that's how I heard it, and that is a good thing, they still sound like the Queensryche I grew up listening to and not some sad, pale imitation.The album opens with X2 an Operation Mindcrime style intro before launching into Where Dreams Go To Die. From there the album forges ahead with Spore and In This Light which took me back to the early to mid 1990s. Redemption is classic Queensryche, enough said. Vindication could have easily been a throw away from the Rage For Order album, while towards the back end of the record you have power tracks Don't Look Back and Fallout. The album draws to a close with Open Road, a big time ballad.All round Queensryche is a very enjoyable listen and enhances the band's legacy. Debate will continue to rage over whether this offering is better that the Geoff Tate recording, you may have your own view, for mine I think they are equal and both do the Queensryche brand justice.SCOTT ROCKENFIELD INTERVIEW ONLINE NOW AT FULL THROTTLE ROCK!"
A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B00CM9JIZ0,4.0,"It's obvious since 1994's Promise Land that Queensryche have been in an alternative, straight ahead rock sort of slump. And when Degarmo left that just made things ten times worse by putting Tate(r) at the helm. Tate began chain smoking after Operation Mindcrime and he crippled his voice down through the years and it shows. A real shame for a former hero of mine, and many others. Now it sounds like a frog is living in his larynx and will never pop out. Also if he wasn't such a jerk people wouldn't mind either, but enough about that bald egomaniac. This album is spectacular in every way shape and form. Except for the fact they leaving you wanting more, because of the short length of the tracks and album overall. Which is small potatoes.Todd La Torre was a great, and actually very strange choice. He was originally a drummer for 24 years, and also played various other instruments but was never \"really\" in a signed band. He was only with Crimson Glory for not even 3 years and didn't even record with them. So this is his first studio vocal effort. And he does a superb job. Getting James \"Jimbo\" Barton back, who produced Empire, Mindcrime, and Promise Land was a brilliant idea, for getting that good old Queensryche sound back again. The first song \"Where Dreams Go To Die\", harkens of old Rage For Order Days, then skews off into the days of \"Empire\" with it's catchy chorus and great guitars. Most songs follow suit and all have great catchy choruses that stick in your head, which is what music needs today. No matter what kind it is.Spore is a brilliant song with definitely has the Rage for Order vibe to it, \"In This Light\" is a great ballad type track that really shows off the diversity of La Torre's pipes, and proves he's every bit of the singer Geoff \"Jester\" Tate once was. Redemption is as Empire as you can get, and really sounds like a bonus track from that album, and if it was 1990, would be all over the air waves. To bad we don't live in that great time period anymore. Vindication is a great Mindcrime type song is which La Torre talks about conquering all, and that they did. The great underrated track to me is \"A World Without\", which gives La Torre a chance to sing in that low Tate type voice we all \"use\" to know and love, and now we can again. This song resembles the actual song \"Promised Land\", only about 4 minutes shorter. And has a great moody, dark vibe about it. This song actually gets stuck in my head more than any other. For some odd reason. Don't Look Back, (and they won't), is a great straight forward fast Mindcrime type song, that much resembles \"The Needle Lies\", \"Speak\", and \"Spreading The Disease\", and does one kick A#$ job at it. I must say the songs are produced just like they were back then.If there is a weak track it would probably be \"Fallout\", which is still a good song, with a great chorus and Empire type vibe. Not close to bad, but just not my personal favorite. The last song, being the major ballad of course is Open Road. This song is a beauty, and has all the great making of the future and past of Queensryche. Many people might consider La Torre a clone but he does have is own sound, and variety of singing. Also a lot of dynamics. He also brings back the aggression on many tracks that hasn't been there in 25 years. And I honestly don't see how Rockenfield and the gang put up with it for so long. They couldn't have been happy. Now after all these years we have back a new a refreshed/charged band that sounds like they did nearly 30 years ago. Also i shouldn't neglect to mention that in an interview i listened to La Torre said they are working on their next album already! So that's what they are doing with all the new material they said was just laying around. I'm ready for more of this, and longer songs, which i'm sure we all are. This is a great taste of what's to come. And even though we live in a world where hight range vocalists are not \"in style\", that doesn't matter. I believe the next album will hit even harder. And they will legally get the name, which they so deserve. Your days are over Geoff, go join Hetfield in the retirement home. Not because you guys are old but because you turned into self absorbed money grubbing freaks. These guys are keeping it real, and now success is theirs for the taking. ;o)Minus one star for wanting MORE!!! ha"
A20ZDV9ZEESN5K,B00CM9JLI4,2.0,I guess the contract mandated that a CD be produced by Tiesto and presto chango one was.I have every In Search Of Cd from Tiesto and Vol. 1 of Club Life along with other Tiesto centric music.  All of which I like to varying degrees but all of which are worthwhile and are the source of some of my favorite music.  This on the other hand seems to be a hastily assembled group of songs that have no relation to each other and represent a most uninspired collection.  There is no risk taken and very little creativity.I genuinely regret purchasing this CD.
AS472HC9PVUAL,B00CM9JLI4,5.0,"Wow i was actually thrilled i got this one by tiesto as I'm gonna go see him live at Hard and he's got a lot of great songs on this compilations, what a legend"
A3FFN5BMXAQK2F,B00CM9JLI4,1.0,"I dont care how successful Tiesto may seem from the outside, truth is the quality of music has taken a back seat for the worst and the troubling fact is that his current fan base continues to decline as his own music. Read the comments and realize how retarded they sound, as if coming from 13 year old kids who not only can't spell but offer no real insight as to why they think the album is great besides a simple \"Wohooo welcome to stockholm everyone and yep he did it again\" I cant bash Tiesto for not producing the type of music i enjoy, he simply isnt that type of quality producer, actually I even question whether he has ever produced his own music. Have you ever seen him in his own studio on Future Music? NO! Have you ever seen him in ANY youtube video producing music or a tutorial with him in the studio? NO! Besides an ancient Greek video produced way back in 2003 on another day at the office, fact is Tiesto pays people to produce his music and garbage at that.Go to In search of sunrise 11 by Richard Durand and realize what a real review look like by PDX and compare what these teenage brats have to say here, its sickening.As for the music, i burned it from my MOG subscription and really couldnt fathom getting past the 4th song. Besides the fact that hardstyle techno is simply not for me, I wont base my review on that but rather that every song sounds absolutely idententical, same leads, riffs and basslines and near identical vocals on everything. No gambles, no Risks and no creativity were taken upon completion of this record. The intro sounds exactly like Vol. 2 Miami and the mixing is nowhere near what he used to put out specifically on ISOS 4. I almost feel this guy is an imposter, a mere shell of the DJ he used to be back then. However Tiesto will continue to be selling out shows and albums for the same reason people continue to buy outdated devices like the Iphone, IGNORANCE! Its all about the system and business he has in place. Make people believe he produces his own music, travel the world put your hands up in the air for 2 hours collect thousands and do it again the next day in a different country to clueless people. He has figured it out and i have to respect him for getting the best out of his fans and the system, he found a way to beat it and you cant hate on a guy like that. However his music is a different story!"
A3TZPFE4D41S0V,B00CM9JM2Y,4.0,Great fun to hear beloved McCartney songs from different eras sung by some of country's best singers. Sit back and enjoy!
A7I3WFZE31KAZ,B00CM9JM74,1.0,... and you'll be black-out drunk halfway through the album. Freud would have a field day with their lyrics. I enjoyed their last album as it had a lot more groove. This album is more straight up metal with little substance. Very disappointed.
A30CJXMYKXWBKR,B00CM9JM74,5.0,"This album is definitely worth the purchase.  Their previous album &#34;Outlawed&#34; was very good, but this album seems like it is even better."
A1SIXWNSEDP9LT,B00CMB8MXC,5.0,"My son (& maybe myself too) love the song Happy by Pharrell. This cd has it plus some other fun, kid-friendly tunes. He was thrilled when I surprised him with it."
AAGTL3PJ7GHXO,B00CMB8MXC,4.0,"I bought this CD because the song &#34;Happy&#34; was on it and I'd heard it on tv on some show & loved it.  Figured I'd also love other songs on the CD as well, even though I hadn't seen either of the Despicable Me movies.  Well, bought the movie as well and enjoyed it to a point, but it did help me enjoy the CD a bit more because I could then picture what was happening in the movie while listening to the music.  Now there are several songs on the CD I enjoy."
A2WSUPXL63TID6,B00CMV8426,5.0,"I am sooo impressed with this cd!  I have been following Sharon and The Daps forawhile and hands down, this is their best collection of songs. Their sound has alwaysbeen inspired by 60's soul, but the songwriting here takes you there now too.What can I say about Sharon's voice! She is showing a vulnerability on &#34;Slow Down,Love&#34; that makes me wish they continue to put more slower material in their repertoire.I recently read an interview where Sharon stated she was deeply disappointed with theGrammy Awards for not recognizing her bands merit. I totally agree!  You have to havetrue love and understanding of how wonderful soul music is to create the beautiful masterpiecethis is. There is no filler, everything fits perfectly!  I will be wearing this disc out!"
A2TOLQWF59YZON,B00CMV8426,5.0,"The more I listen, the more I want to listen & the more I like it & Many I just LOVE. Do yourself a favor, Buy it !!!! In retrospect however, I would buy the Deluxe CD & get the free Rip; but I didn't want to wait.... !"
A2YJ1K8M0KPHMF,B00CMV8426,4.0,"Retro and brilliant.  Band's execution is flawless and studio mixing is smart.  No autotune that I can hear.  There's actual bass in the tracks and little to no compression.A couple of tracks dont quite work completely, but there's too many winners for it to matter,"
A2VBFV0XEY04KZ,B00CMVWOCM,3.0,"I really like their other two albums, but this one seemed to be missing the blockbuster appeal of some of the other big tracks they've done."
A2U7DXDNYBBLQJ,B00CMVWOCM,4.0,"This album, for me, sits between a 3 and a 4. The primary reason for that is that the middle of this otherwise brilliant album is rather rough. Then again, as a sarcastic device aimed at today's popular music scene, it may be that way on purpose. The fact is that these three continue to bring some serious laughs in a (mostly) listenable way. If you hate the actual sound of the pop music scene altogether, then this album may fly right over your head. But if it's mainly the mindless lyrical content plaguing the sound which enrages you, then I think you'll adore this disc. There are some clear attempts here at giving fans more of what they love from each of their previous albums as well. And with guestspots as random and bewildering as Too $hort and Hugh Jackman, it must be heard to be believed. Comedy is a rough sell after a few albums, as you could easily tell by the high volume of 3's given by the older fans. But keep in mind that this is satirical. You're supposed to somewhat despise yourself for enjoying the sounds to be found on this album. Give it a shot though. The Lonely Island is far from running out of steam. And the majority of this cd proves that."
A2GG2IHXMVIH77,B00CMYRLV8,5.0,Another excellent album from the Hillsong franchise. I didn't buy the record here because a large competitor to Amazon has 6 videos for about the same price.
A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B00CMYRLV8,4.0,"Prime Cuts: Christ is Enough, You Crown the Year, Glorious Ruins\"Glorious Ruins\" is an oxymoron.  In secular parlance, it would be ludicrous to search for glory within the debris of one's ruins.  But in the demands of the Gospel glory and ruins are, like two sides of a coin, indispensable.  The call of Christ is to die.  We are called us first and foremost to die to sin, ourselves and our selfish desires.  Unless we first learn to die in utter ruins, there can never be any resurrection into Christ's glorious life.  This Gospel paradox is the apotheosis of Hillsong Live's twenty second live album. Released perennial normally in July, the release of \"Glorious Ruins\" is to coincide with the Mega Church's yearly conference in Sydney, Australia.  As there's ring of melancholy accompanying the notion of ruins, what's most heartbreaking about \"Glorious Ruins\" is the complete absence of Darlene Zschech.  For 21 albums, Zschech has been the face, the voice, the pioneer, the orchestrator and the visionary behind each and every Hillsong Live album.  More than just known for writing some of Hillsong's most popular worship staples such as \"Shout to the Lord,\" \"Worthy is the Lamb\" and \"At the Cross,\" Zschech took what was the worship music of a suburban church to an International level.  Zschech's absence is definitely a felt loss here.  Without Zschech at the helm, the vocals are split between the usual crew of Reuben Morgan, Matt Crocker, Joel Houston, Jad Gillies, Ben Fielding, Jonathon Douglass, Annie Garratt and Dave Ware.  The only featured new lead vocalist is senior pastor Brian Houston's daughter Laura Toganivalu.\"Glorious Ruins,\" the title cut, a song led and co-written by Joel Houston expresses the very heart of this record when Houston sings, \"Let the ruins come to life/In the beauty of Your Name/Rising up from the ashes/God forever You reign.\"  This pensive worship ballad that speaks of resurrection after all we have hoped for in life has crashed has a holy reminiscence of how God raised an army out of dry bones in Ezekiel's time. \"Christ is Enough,\" on the other hand, is one of two Reuben Morgan led songs.  \"Christ is Enough\" comes into two movements within the song:  the first finds Morgan exalting the eminence of Christ as our all sufficient need.  The second movement seamlessly tags on our response to Him with the hymn \"I Have Decided to Follow Jesus.\"  The other Reuben Morgan-led song \"Glorify Your Name\" is this album's lodestar.  Co-written by Morgan with worship music's biggest names including Matt Maher, Chris Tomlin, Jason Ingram and Ed Cash, \"Glorify Your Name\" is a twenty first century \"How Great Thou Art.\"However, in the post-Zschech configuration of Hillsong Live, there is an absence of the female sound.  Initially what set Hillsong Live apart was Zschech's mellifluous vocals.  Even on songs she was not singing lead, she would always add her haunting harmonies to create a rich vocal layer that has become their patented sound.  This time round, Annie Garratt and Laura Toganivalu are the only female representatives here.  Garratt who got to sing lead on two full cuts on \"Cornerstone\" gets only get to sing lead on the last verse of \"Man of Sorrows\" with Jad Gillies. \"Man of Sorrows\" exhibits all of Brooke Ligertwood's (Fraser) greatness:  intricate Scripturally-woven lyrics and a stately hymn-like melodic structure.  Another Ligterwood co-write is \"You Crowned the Year\" featuring Laura Toganival on vocals.  \"You Crowned the Year\" is a celebration of God's goodness to all who draw near to Him based on Psalm 65:11.  However, just like Zschech, Ligertwood's voice (she sang lead on previous Hillsong's favorites such as \"Lord of Lords\" and \"Hosanna\") is dearly missed.Fans who love the fast and sturdy worship builders such as \"Running' or \"Salvation is Here\" or \"Better than Life:\" will definitely love the hook -laden \"Always Will.\"  However, the blatantly few female leads and far too many sound-alike male leads make some of the tracks flow one into another without much distinction.  Also, tracks like \"Closer\" and \"God Who Saves\" may find great affinity with today's modern worship songs but they have pilfered their distinctiveness along the way.  Nevertheless, despite these quibbles, \"Glorious Ruins\" is still one of this year's best worship albums.  This record again quiets the myth that Hillsong Live is all about hype.  Rather, they are a talented faith-filled worship band that believes that even after our lives are blown into smithereens, we will still rise again from our ruins.  Such resurrection comes not from the outflow of our goodness or our strength.  Rather, it is a testimonial to the death-defying power of our glorious and resurrected Christ."
A2T0Q46RSI9EQF,B00CMYRRG2,5.0,If you've been waiting for Raheem Devaughn's music you definitely got what you were waiting for.  He still delivers his rhythmic soul and sexy beats.  I love it.
A92F571Y9MTW6,B00CMYRRG2,4.0,"Raheem DeVaughn is one of those singers whose career could have made him a bigger star. He initially made his recording debut on the soundtrack to the Nick Cannon film \"Drumline\" with the song \"My Own Thing\". He then made three appearances on DJ Jazzy Jeff's debut album \"The Magnificent\". From there, he landed a recording contract with Jive Records to release his 2005 debut \"The Love Experience\". In 2008, he released \"Love Behind The Melody\"- a recording which contained his biggest hit \"Customer\". Even though Jive was pushing him in the direction to create more songs along those lines, he threw the label a curveball. He did that in the form of releasing the 2010 semi-concept album \"The Love And War MasterPiece\". For all of the success he could have had at Jive Records, he seemed to be a low priority at the label behind their bigger stars. At the time he signed his deal, the company was already home to Joe and R. Kelly. After Arista was shuttered before the release of his debut, the label also gained former Arista artists Usher, Ciara, Anthony Hamilton and Donell Jones. Further complicating things was being a labelmate to the teen pop heartthrob Chris Brown. After three albums with a major label, Raheem decided to go independent by the time 2011 came to a close.He kept his name out there in the public eye by appearing on a multitude of songs. He landed guest appearances on albums by Rapsody, Stat Quo, Saigon, Big K.R.I.T., Raekwon and Kindred The Family Soul, among others. In 2013, Raheem resurfaced on the independent label Mass Appeal Entertainment, which is also home to SWV, Lyfe Jennings and Noel Gourdin. It was there he released his fourth recording \"A Place Called Loveland\". On his new album, gone is the production talents of longtime producer Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez of Masters At Work. Instead, he works closely with the production team Ivan \"Orthodox\" Barias & Carvin \"Ransum\" Haggins as well as producers Maurice \"Mo Digga\" Randolph and DeAndre \"Dre King\" Shaifer. On this new album, he sticks to the theme of love- as evidenced by the first single \"Love Connection. He sings another Ne-Yo penned song behind 2010' \"I Don't Care\"- this time around, he belts out the ballad \"Ridiculous\". He laments over losing a woman due to his philandering on \"Wrong Forever\", while being undecided on his relationship status on \"Complicated\". He works with producer Mario Winans on the sultry ballad \"Pink Crush Velvet\" and Adonis Shropshire on \"Cry Baby\". He sings the praises of a good woman on \"Make 'Em Like You\" and addresses conception on \"Make A Baby\". Overall, \"A Place Called Love Land\" is a solid album from Raheem DeVaughn. While the album leans a little too heavy on the sexual content, Raheem sticks to the music that made him famous."
A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B00CMYRS9I,4.0,"To cut to the chase: this is a long overdue reissue of the two excellent --- and I mean wonderful/great/fabulous --- albums that the Swimming Pool Q's recorded for the A&M; label in the 1980s. I give 5 stars for the music on those albums, including the bonus disc of rare, unreleased tracks you get with this reissue. But I have to downgrade my rating for the poor quality of the packaging. I've been a diehard Q's fan for decades, so it pains me to voice any sort of criticism, but there are so many problems with the packaging of this CD set that it truly takes away from the pleasure of owning it.I'm not going to rehash other reviews and tell you what this band is all about except to take issue with one reviewer that took them to task for thinking they \"aren't as weird as they think they are.\" Huh? Well, I'm not sure the Q's were, or are, trying to be \"weird\", like some sort of wacky \"new wave\" or \"alternative\" act. In their very early days, years before these two albums were recorded, they might have been considered odd by music industry standards at the time, but they very quickly honed their sound and --- dare I say the word --- matured, and ended up being a very solid and musically diverse unit. What you hear on these two albums is the sound of a tight, confident band hitting their stride. You have rockers, tunes of beauty, quirky and funky tunes, and some fantastic pop. Indeed, it's almost an impossible task trying to categorize this music or confine it to a convenient genre. If you forced me to compare them to anyone, I'd say: mix the LA band X with mid-70s Fleetwood Mac (think of Jeff Calder as John Doe, with Anne Richmond Boston in a Christine McVie role), along with a dash of Captain Beefheart and a dollop of John Hiatt ... and then shake well. Okay, that's a rough idea. You can call this \"alternative\" or \"Americana\" or \"Southern New Rock\" and it still doesn't quite hit the mark. It's just the Swimming Pool Q's, and it's pretty addictive stuff.  Songs like \"Some New Highway\" and \"More Than One Heaven\" rank as the very best of their tunes; brilliant, triumphant, magestic songs that needs to be heard by more music fans. Okay, maybe I'm getting carried away, but the raving is justified. I love this band and think they were an important 80s act, yet they remain criminally underrated.It's a sheer pleasure hearing these two albums again, and the bonus disc contains a treasure trove of unreleased goodies that will have longtime fans salivating. But that bonus disc is one of the problems with this reissue. Why? Because there is no track listing and it comes in a separate plain paper sleeve with only \"Pow Wow Hour: Rarities 1982-1986\" printed on the disc itself. If you want to know what exactly is on this disc you either have to find the info on the band's excellent website or copy it from this page on Amazon. Along with the odd absence of track listings, I would have enjoyed a brief synopsis of each song, just a few lines telling us more about the track and its origins. For example, there are two more versions of \"More Than One Heaven\" on this bonus disc but no explanation about why this is the case or why these versions didn't make the original album. The other complaint is the paper gatefold \"package\" that houses the two main CDs. It's cheap and flimsy, like something that was made in an arts & crafts class. Yes, it looks nice, but I can tell you already it's not durable enough to withstand a few years (or months) or multiple plays and being stored on a shelf with other CDs. Really, I can't think of another CD package (and I own several thousand CDs) that is this cheaply constructed. I understood that the band had budget constraints in putting this entire project together, and no doubt had to cut corners to make it all feasible, but I would have gladly paid a bit extra for a more durable package, and one that contained more details and information in the CD booklet (which otherwise is very nice). Again, I almost hate to complain, but this could have been a truly brilliant reissue, and the magnificence of the music is somewhat tarnished by these issues.But when I listen to this music, I can't help but smile and admire the genius of Jeff Calder's lyrics and quality of his songs, the guitar brilliance of Bob Elsey, and the lovely voice of Anne Richmond Boston, and the knock-em dead rhythm section of Billy and J.E. Sit back and listen as Jeff sings:\"You know, life has so many hidden pleasures and assorted charms...\"And this music is one of them. Don't let complaints about the packaging prevent you from getting this reissue. This is vital music."
A2O57LB3BP3WTS,B00CMYRSQG,5.0,"On their fifth studio album, AUGUST BURNS RED continue to develop into one of the best metalcore bands there ever was with RESCUE AND RESTORE, which is also one of the best albums of the year. I'm actually very surprised that AUGUST BURNS RED had branched out much more than they have on previous records. Not to say that this album strays away completely from metalcore, but there are certainly a number of different musical instruments brought forth into their sound, such as stringed instruments, congas, and even a horn section at the end of CREATIVE CAPTIVITY, which is my least favorite track and is actually a terrible song. (I'm not going to knock this album down because of it, but still, the song is horrible. I won't go into detail here, but please listen to the song in full, and you'll see why I don't like it.) They even tune down their guitars to Drop B for the songs PROVISION and FAULT LINE, which is right up there with PARADOX and WHITE WASHED as one of the best AUGUST BURNS RED songs. Also, Dustin (the bassist) has more of a presence on this record, both vocally and musically, and even though Jake Luhrs is beast when it comes to vocals, Dustin's contribution is definitely not a bad thing! Overall, if you want an honest metalcore album that is set to break boundaries more than ever before, pick this album up.Rating: 4.9 stars/5 stars"
A2RBZRQCOKAH8M,B00CMYRTA6,5.0,Yo Phish Ventura 6 cd set.  I just had to have this cd set.  I can't wait to blast if on my sound system.
AJPZM4SPH96WB,B00CMYRTA6,5.0,"I've been a fan for almost 20 years and own many (not all) of the group's live releases. From a performance standpoint, these two shows are among the strongest they've put out. Shows from 1997 and 1998 remain very popular among fans and these were arguably the last two truly great years for Phish. These Ventura shows are rippers from beginning to end. Whereas they often overindulged in funk jams during  1997 (see Hampton and Denver releases), this show is more of a rocker. Same for the '98 show. The highlights are really too numerous to mention.What puts this release so far ahead of others is the sound. The engineers utilized the multitrack tapes instead of the usual two track ones. The depth, clarity, ambience and balance of music and audience response here is unrivaled by any of their other releases. The drums in particular sound incredible. Whoever was involved with the sound on these discs should win an award.I doubt any old school fans need convincing but if you're new the band and are interested in collecting live shows, this is an excellent place to start."

A23FQRKY8W2MM4,B00CMYRVAO,5.0,ALWAYS LIKED JOE SINGING SKILLS AND HE STILL MANAGES TO KEEP EVOLVING WITH EACH NEW CD KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
A1YAX8JNPO8WK2,B00CMYRVAO,4.0,"Joe is one of my favorite male singer. His lyrics are so well place. For expressing his love to the female sex. It like did U received this message, his thoughts of pleasure. Enough said about Joe."
A92F571Y9MTW6,B00CMYRVAO,5.0,"In his two decade career, Opelika, Alabama native Joe Thomas has maintained a level of consistency. He made a career off being the sensitive loverman and hasn't strayed too far from his roots. After he left high school, he signed a deal with Mercury Records to release his 1993 debut \"Everything\". While he scored a few top 20 hits, Mercury didn't know what to do with a singer who was the complete opposite of his onetime labelmate Brian McKnight. He asked for a release from his contract, while writing and producing for other artists- notably Hi-Five and Usher. He landed a huge hit with \"All The Things (Your Man Won't Do)\" while still being an unsigned artist. He landed on Jive Records in 1997, where he would release his classic sophomore effort \"All That I Am\". While still writing and producing for other artists (Profyle, Ideal, Xscape, The Temptations) and dueting with Big Pun and Mariah Carey, he saw his biggest success right around the corner. In 2000, he released his third album- the most successful of his career \"My Name Is Joe\". The next few years saw him release three more records for Jive- the underrated \"Better Days\", the middling \"And Then...\" and his final album for the label \"Ain't Nothin' Like Me\".He went independent for his next three albums on the reactivated Kedar Entertainment. He started with the uptempo \"Joe Thomas, New Man\", followed by the live instrumentation of \"Signature\" and 2011's \"The Good, The Bad, The Sexy\". He was handpicked by LL Cool J for the song \"Take It\" from LL's recently released album \"Authentic\". Joe's longtime manager Kedar Massenburg started a new label after the folding of Kedar Entertainment called Massenburg Media. It would be there where Joe would release his newest album \"Double Back: Evolution Of R&B;\". While the album's title speaks of evolving, it's really a continuation of his 2009 album \"Signature\". Joe handles the writing and production of roughly half the album, though he brings along a few familiar names. The production team Stargate- who previously worked with Joe on the song \"If I Was Your Man\"- handles the song \"Compromise\", in which Joe tries to find common ground with his significant other. The production team The Ambassadorz (who previously appeared on \"The Good, The Bad, The Sexy\") contributes the sensual ballad \"More\". Producer Derek \"D.O.A.\" Allen (Best known for Blackgirl's \"Krazy\" and Tyrese's \"Lately\") handles production on four songs- \"Easy\", the Fantasia Barrino duet \"Love & Sex\", the Too Short featured \"1 To 1 Ratio\" and the first single \"I'd Rather Have A Love\". Finally, Joe sings of making poor decisions while falling in love on the ode to strippers \"Magic City\". Joe's \"Double Back: Evolution Of R&B;\" is another great album from the veteran talent. With twenty years under his belt, he shows that he still has it and hasn't lost a step in his music."

AIM1A1HIA6TAD,B00CN1FJLO,5.0,"It's a pity that RCA didn't record Moffo as Aida or Desdemona. By the evidence of this, she could certainly perform them quite well. If Amazon doesn't have it, buy it from Amazon.co.uk (where I ordered mine) or Amazon.de (German website)."
AOA0LCJD5NAQ1,B00CNIDH7K,5.0,I Was dissing her before this album dropped.I had to shut my mouth when i was listening to this masterpiece.Love Me Till I Die is mind blowing.
A1TL00NO6BA8P2,B00CNIDH7K,5.0,"First Kelly Rowland CD I've bought and loved it!!  Great music, great arrangements, and an even greater voice!  Kelly, you did it!"
A1MV3S4BHBGEZS,B00CNIDH7K,5.0,"I have been a fan of Kelly Rowland since the DC days, and I must say this is her most impressive work yet. Taking us on a very intimate and personal journey, Kelly has given a lot of us a whole new perspective on her as a person, and as an artist. This album has helped me think about and analyze some very similar situations. I absolutely love that she allowed herself to be vulnerable enough to let the fans connect to her, and strong enough to overcome those situations."
AKNIYS6S87GPH,B00CNIDHO8,5.0,the driving force of Wolfmother is back and rock'n...think this better than Wolfmothers last effort..Andrew Stockdale has something to say and I like what he is saying.
A1ISW6NMR45Y71,B00CNIDHO8,4.0,"I am absolutely captivated by Wolfmother.  Each album has at least four infectious songs which I can listen to countless times every time the disc goes through my rotation.  Stockdale's voice is epic, and the energy and vibe on the Wolfmother albums are intoxicating.  Heavy riffage with that spectacular, mournful voice--unique yet classic.So, in the absence of any new Wolfmother albums, I had to buy this by default.  For some reason I wasn't very inspired by the album's cover.  Some hillbilly dude driving a truck??  Oh, is that Stockdale??  Okay, whatever.  I sensed the cover might reflect a mundane  musical experience on the inside.It didn't. Not really.  The album is good.  I enjoyed it.  But it is no where near life-altering or epic or historic.  Instead....it is merely solid--worth a few plays.I just really wish that Stockdale would make up with his former bandmates and get back to cranking out some more of the amazing stuff.  I've been waiting a few years and time is passing and I wonder if he has lost the drive or the magic.  Well, at least he put out two albums which are destined to be classics.  But I wish it was more like a dozen albums.  Until then, this appears to be Wolfmother's Coda or Let It Be.  The last, but far from the best."
A6TCD92V1GHZD,B00CO6UCME,5.0,"Awesome band, love the song with Lacey Sturm."
A3VFKHCGUS1WFU,B00CO6UCME,5.0,"Excellent music!! Best played loudly :) I was pleasantly surprised to find I like this CD even more than I expected to! We As Human, what a talented group of musicians! They Rock!"
A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B00CO8KNAS,5.0,"Another fine release from this powerful vocalist and songwriter. An album full of rock, blues, soul and even a hint of country. Mostly co-written withher more than competent guitarist Jon Diamond.Impeccable musicianship with a decisive 70s feel on the majority of tracks with remnants of vintage Stones and Free. While the titletrack seems purely Janis Joplin and Big Brother. And even though there might not be an immediate 'hit' all the songs are wellcrafted and by repeated listenings they start rotating on the inner jukebox. Especially \"Vagabond Wind\".But however excellent the songs, the musicians and the production, the main attraction is the voice of Dana Fuchs. Her ability to get inside her meaningful lyrics and sing the songs from the heart. Convincing the listener that she is a woman with a mission that goes far beyond stardom and the like.Classic rock at its contemporary finest."
A1W39RVVQO7H1M,B00COCY67A,5.0,A great collection of songs and it is like you are at the studio with him.  He is the King of Rock n' Roll.
A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00COCY67A,5.0,"After being very prolific in the studio from 1969-71, Elvis concentrated mostly on live performing in 1972 and early 1973, recording just seven songs in the studio.  Early in 1973, shortly after theAloha From Hawaii via Satellite album (Legacy Edition)hit #1 on the charts, Elvis and the Colonel sold all of The King's pre-1973 catalog to RCA, and signed a new 7-year contract with the label (which Elvis, sadly, did not outlive).  New studio recordings were mandated as part of the deal, so rather than go back to Nashville or Hollywood, it was decided to return to Elvis' hometown of Memphis, so that he could visit his daughter, Lisa Marie, and sleep in his own bed at Graceland.  With Chips Moman's American Sound Studio, the site of the historic 1969 sessions, now closed, Stax Studios - only 10 minutes from Graceland - was chosen.  Two separate sessions were done, in July and December of 1973, and RCA released the material rather haphazardly over three albums between 1973 and 1975:Raised on Rock,Good Times, andPromised Land, as well as various posthumous compilations.This new Legacy Recordings release finally collects all of Elvis' Stax material in one place.  Disc 1 contains 17 R&B; and country outtakes; Disc 2 has 10 pop outtakes and the ten July 1973 masters, and Disc 3 contains the 18 December 1973 masters.  You'll hear Elvis in top form on classics like \"My Boy,\" \"If You Talk In Your Sleep,\" \"I Got A Feelin' In My Body,\" \"Promised Land,\" \"Spanish Eyes\" (just as good as Al Martino's original), \"Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues,\" and many, many more.  Disc 3 is my favorite, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the rest of it.  Legacy has packaged this set similarly to the Elvis MSG collection,Prince From Another Planet (Deluxe 2 CD/1 DVD Box Set).  This set is a must-have for any Elvis fan."
A1A7BH2GUDDEHY,B00COCY67A,5.0,"This is another lovingly compiled collection of Elvis's 70s recordings at the great Stax studio. Critically dismissed at the time of their original release, these songs put Elvis in one of the great rock and roll studios ever and use a mixture of Elvis's guys and Stax greats to record a typically diverse group of songs including rock, pop, country, blues and gospel. As with all of Elvis's 70s recordings, they were surprisingly uncommercial for American radio of the day, with just a few songs clearly designed to be singles (Raised on Rock the best example), which showed that Elvis had stopped trying to make hits and just recorded songs he liked. The result is an collection that shows that Elvis could still shine when he liked the material as he clearly did at Stax. It's Midnight, Honkey Tonk Angel, and Loving Arms are great country songs. If that Isn't Love is a classic Elvis gospel. And then there's Promised Land, the greatest recording of one of Chuck Berry's great songs, a song that showed what Elvis was still- capable of doing with quality rock material."
AAOCRGZTGY0LQ,B00COQKDT6,5.0,"This cd is even better than their first, & I gave their first a 5 star rating, so what's that tell you? It'd definitely different. They throw in a little bit of everything on this cd... rap, rock, metal, alternative, pop, dubstep, etc. One thing I will say though is that this cd DEFINITELY needs a Parental Advisory sticker. The only song I truly don't enjoy is &#34;Born to Lead&#34;, that song is a bit much, but every other song gets 20/10 rating!"
AZTZ61W23JET0,B00CP4RZIO,5.0,"I must admit, without Rob Arnold, I didn't have high hopes for this album.  The replacement for Arnold, Emil, can definitely shred.  He'll definitely remind you of Arnold. Funky time signatures and that sludgy Chimaira sound is still there!  In all honesty, I'd rate it as Chimaira's 3rd best album after IOR and S/T.  My favorite tracks are Plastic Wonderland, All That's Left Is Blood, No Mercy and Spineless."
A2JHO6E0BCHRGR,B00CP4RZIO,5.0,"Despite being plagued by line up changes through out the years, Chimaira has managed to deliver hardcore metal and superior guitar shredding to the masses! I have been a dedicated fan since I discovered them just last year, I've have all their albums from &#34;This Present Darkness&#34; to present and can honestly say that I love every single song....I don't know how many people can say that about their favorite band or any band in general. It's hard for me to choose a favorite album, This is a great album but in all honesty I still love their previous albums much more. I absolutely love the track &#34;Wrapped in Violence&#34; and other tracks that stand out are &#34;Plastic Wonderland&#34; ... &#34;No Mercy&#34; ... and &#34;Kings of the Shadow world&#34;. The album artwork is also great! Chimaira is here to stay and this album certainly makes that clear!"
A1HCCW38EQQBTY,B00CP4S03I,5.0,"My co-workers have talked about her, and I took a chance on this recording.  I totally dug it!  She's fresh and in the groove of her music, and I spun that cd around my disc player 3 times.  This is how I want my R&B to be...completely R&B, from beginning to end.  She made it work and I must go back and inform my fellow co-workers that they have converted me to ride the Algebra train.  I just hope that it don't take another 5 years to release another disc.  She's got that vibe that's been missing from music for a while now, and I hope that she never loses it."
A3M459NLAT69P8,B00CP4S434,1.0,"Fortunately for me I did not purchase this...I sampled all the tracks online for the mp3 version and I am glad I did...the quality is atrocious!  Offical Bootleg, you got to be kidding me, no one would authorize this or make an offical release if they cared about the consumers.  I feel for the ones who bought this and were excited.  Great great band, just lousy sound quality."
A24KCU2REK892I,B00CP4S434,3.0,"ITS BOOTLEG QUALITY ALRIGHT.BUT IF YOUR A CAPTAIN BEYOND FAN, ITS A MUST HAVE. WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM LIVE."
A3FHN6AIATT19K,B00CP4S434,2.0,"Don't be hooked/fooled by the description of being \"digitally remastered\".  You can digitally remaster anything but if the original recordings are bad, nothing in the world will make them sound good.There are some great performances within, but it's hard to enjoy because the sound is just bootleg-quality awful.  As you listen through the disc you HOPE the NEXT show will sound better, but it never does.  The last show from 1977 does have a modicum of clarity better than the previous 3 shows from 1971/72 but that isn't saying much.I'm a big fan of Bobby Caldwell's drumming but you'll never be able to judge it from this.  All you hear is a constant hiss of symbols and occasionally a drum roll or something.  The musicians all sound like a wall of pink noise and only the vocals stand out at all, but that still isn't good enough.The package is nice with colorful artwork & photos but that's the only thing that kept me from rating it 1 star.Nobody except hard-core fans and completists should venture into this myopic void.  Casual fans and the curious should buy their first 2 LPs on CD first.  If you have to have a live show, the \"Live in Texas 1973\" is better sounding than this.  This would probably not be listened to more than once by 90% who hear it, and some will not be able to get through it even once.To be fair, the package DOES call this an \"Official Bootleg\", and that's about the best that can be said.  Also the sleeve note does explain the band was never professionally recorded in its brief existence, so that does explain why there arn't many live recordings of this band, except bootleg-quality.  Too bad.Captain Beyond was a good band of their time and genre; this is just not anywhere near where to start."
A1HC367HZKCH00,B00CP78REM,4.0,"He has amazing fingering and playing skills and a decent singing voice.  Some of the songs are for the Bieber crowd but there are others that are acceptable for a more mature audience.  One thing I disliked was the lame intro for the last song, but the song itself was great.  Also had to assume all the songs were written/composed by Quinn, but there was no acknowledgment of authorship with the album.  These are things I want to know."
A325K75JJOGDYZ,B00CPRV8I4,4.0,"I liked this cd. I am a follower of Disturbed and Evans Blue but the style of this cd is closer to the sound of Evan Blue. It is an interesting album with good production and good songs and an overall easy listening cd. If you want a cd of good modern hard rock you liked this album, but if you want a sound closer to Disturbed this cd might disappoint you and you should listen Device"
ATCJFCF5SLCI4,B00CPRV8I4,5.0,"Doesn't sound like any of the bands these accomplished musicians come from,new and interesting sounds,very ,very recommended,can't wait to see them live."
AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B00CPSVAY0,4.0,"The score for \"World War Z\" is well done. There are some minor flaws in my opinion, but overall its a nice soundtrack and one that surely will work within the film. The music seems to walk the line between disaster epic and zombie picture - you can hear the typical elements from both genres in this score.I think that the more melodic tracks are the best here: my favorite track is \"The Lane Family\" [Track 2]. Another of my favorites is the final track, titled \"Like a River Around a Rock\" - its a triumphant cue that really serves as a nice finale to the album.If there's one nitpick I have, its that I think the score relies a little too much on drums.  But overall, I recommend this soundtrack. As always, you should sample it first before making a purchase. I am a fan of composer Marco Beltrami. Although this score is perfectly adequate, I think he has done better work. I actually prefer his scores to smaller movies, such as 3:10 to Yuma and The Hurt Locker."
A3H7HYC9HIQAAQ,B00CPSVAY0,4.0,"Despite initially looking like a potentially disastrous movie, with the whole final third of the movie having to be re-written and re-shot following disastrous initial test screenings, World War Z is actually of the most intelligent and interesting zombie movies of recent years. With the 28 Days Later franchise, the Walking Dead TV show, and countless other imitators, zombies are de rigeur these days, but where World War Z differs is in the fact that it plays more like a tense medical thriller than a traditional zombie-slaughtering action flick, concentrating on the efforts to stem the tide of the potential apocalypse and save the afflicted rather than simply massacring them. Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations specialist who is called back into the fray from his quiet family life in suburban Philadelphia when a pandemic of global proportions erupts - people are turning into vicious, violent zombies at an alarming rate and if Gerry and his colleagues can't find the source, or the cure, it could be the end of humanity as we know it. The film is adapted from the popular novel by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Forster, whose previous films include Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland and the flop James Bond film Quantum of Solace; it co-stars Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz and James Badge Dale.Writing the music for World War Z is the ridiculously busy composer Marco Beltrami, in what is his second zombie movie of 2013 after Warm Bodies, and the third of his scheduled seven feature films this year. Beltrami has always been a creative, innovative composer, and his work on World War Z is no exception; the score features a large and powerful symphony orchestra augmented by the now ubiquitous electronic enhancements, but the really interesting parts are in some of the specialty instruments Beltrami concocted to create the disturbing, menacing sonic world that Pitt's character finds himself. According to the press coverage that accompanied the soundtrack release, Beltrami based all the melody, harmony, and rhythm of the score on the sound of the U.S. Emergency Broadcast System signal siren, and then incorporated non-traditional percussive elements such as the sound of animal skulls and teeth being mashed together, to create his menacing sonic palette.What all this means in practice is that the score is very dark, very brutal, short on melody, but containing enough up-front action to satisfy even the most demanding genre fans. One of the things I like about World War Z is how organic it sounds; the orchestra and samples never sounds as though they are competing for attention, instead blending together perfectly so that one would sound incomplete without the other. Too many contemporary action scores seem to simply layer the electronics over the top of the live instruments without any real thought for why they are there or what they are doing, other than the fact that someone, somewhere decided that they should be there in order to appeal to the kids. World War Z's hybrid sound is not like that at all: at times the electronics are the driving pulse of the score, while elsewhere the orchestra is leading the charge, but it always sounds natural and appropriate.The score, basically, is split into three distinct styles: a tense moodiness that permeates the entire project, balls-to-the-wall action, and brooding, yet vaguely optimistic thematic writing that hints at a brighter future for the inhabitants of this ruined world.The action sequences are intense. Cues such as the opening \"Philadelphia\", \"Ninja Quiet\", and especially the enormous \"Zombies in Coach\" are relentless explosions of rhythm and raw power. The brass section screams and howls in unison in a manner not too dissimilar to the best work of Elliot Goldenthal. The string section churns violently to give the pieces internal pacing and forward momentum, and the rest of the orchestra provides all manner of unusual performance effects, ranging from screeching high register woodwinds to throaty, raspy trombone blasts down in the depths of the mix. Around all this, the electronic enhancements provide interesting textural nuances - there's even a sampled helicopter rotor in the aforementioned \"Ninja Quiet\" - while in several cues a growling, heavy electric guitar gives the score a modern, edgy grittiness. It's quite exhilarating.The tension and moodiness comes via cues such as \"Searching for Clues\", the first part of \"NJ Mart\", \"Hand Off\" and \"No Teeth No Bite\", which are more low-key and downbeat, featuring a lot more understated string sustains, electronic pulses and stark piano chords, accompanying Gerry on his quest for answers in the face of world wide meltdown.After a few moments of brief respite in the pretty and intimate \"The Lane Family\", its is only when we reach the final three cues that score offers a brief sense of hope. The exciting, energetic, highly rhythmic \"The Salvation Gates\" is as close as the score comes to presenting something heroic, and parts of \"Wales\" are really quite lovely in a pseudo-grungy sort of way, while the conclusive \"Like A River Around A Rock\" allows the electric guitar to take full center stage with a lead performance that is world-weary, shell-shocked and resigned, but comes with a bittersweet sense of relief. This isn't a cathartic release by any means - the themes are still grim and firmly entrenched in the misery of the world - but it's a little something for the listener to latch onto in defiance of all the death and destruction.World War Z is full of innovation and creative thinking on Beltrami's part, and in listening to the score you can't help but be impressed at the way in which the score is structured, layered and presented to have the greatest horrific effect. As an actual enjoyable musical experience, however, your appreciation for the score will depend entirely on your tolerance for extended periods of atonal, aggressive, at times viciously dark writing. For all it's intellectual design and thoughtful approach to orchestration and texture, this is still a horror score through and through, and it is with that caveat in mind that I give it a recommendation to those who already know they appreciate music from the genre.One final note: in the film itself, there is additional music by singer/songwriter Matthew Bellamy of the immensely successful and popular rock band Muse - two original pieces called \"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\" and \"Follow Me\" - but none of his music appears on the soundtrack CD."
A1W7N3EWY7CX8H,B00CPSVAY0,5.0,This is a really good soundtrack. It's as action packed as the movie. I highly recommend this soundtrack if you enjoyed the movie.
A1QWA1MZDTANOA,B00CPWTRAA,4.0,"There have been few, if any, careers in opera to equal that of Placido Domingo. I first heard him in 1969, as Manrico in the new Met production of \"il Trovatore\", singing beside Leontyne Price, Grace Bumbry and Sherrill Milnes. He made his entrance at the end of Act 2 swinging in on a rope, the very image of youthful virility and impetuosity. He managed the high note at the end of \"di quella pira\", although he did not linger on it, and that was always his way, like most spintos, with high notes. He spent the next four decades and more at the very top of the opera world with a repertoire truly breathtaking in its range, including well-respected Wagner interpretations alongside the great Italian and French roles.  Here we are almost 45 years later, with a generous (70 minute) recital of extremely heavy, demanding Verdi roles, as a baritone. Among important tenors I can think of only a few who have sung successfully as baritones late in their career; Ramon Vinay comes to mind. Many tenors have begun as baritones, and Domingo might be thought to have done so since he began singing baritone in zarzuela as a very young man. There is much to appreciate here, especially his great energy and engagement with the dramatic requirements of the music. He is not afraid to make an ugly sound: the beginning of the Council Chamber scene from \"Simon Boccangraa\" is a shout of rage, and later his denunciation of Paolo is quite chilling. His lower voice has been developed very successfully; it sounds more baritonal, in fact, than many \"real\" Verdi baritones, who are often somewhat weak at the bottom of their range. He sings with enormous passion and truthfulness, a proud, still-strong old man who has nothing to lose and who will not go gently. There is often a pronounced beat, an inevitable loosening of vibrato, but never a wobble. He sounds better than any of the male singers in the supporting parts--in fact Machado is far less steady than Domingo in Don Carlos' prison cell. He is daring in his choice of repertoire, including the extremely exposed music from \"Ernani\" and the high-lying, treacherous tessitura of \"il balen\", with not entirely perfect success. The angry, vigorous characters are somewhat more comfortable than the contemplative ones. It would be foolish to expect real vocal freshness or consistent tonal beauty from him, from any singer, at 70, and those are not on offer. What you'll find here is complete fearlessness, a lifetime's hard-won craft and an indomitable passion. Verdi never wrote the King Lear he tried throughout much of his life to create, but the spirit of King Lear is Domingo's here. Whatever quibbles might be made, I think old Verdi would be proud."
A2MOREZ3AFKKOK,B00CQGU9GG,5.0,"Even though I have most everything the Top has done, I like this set very much. It has all of the discs that I am really interested in.With all their major hits and great blues guitar music dating to their first album, as well as their 'synthetic' adventures on the newer material here. The thing about this box set, is they re-mastered it correctly. They kept the original sound and feel. A lot of the re-mixes nowadays are just that. They lay in riffs from studio sessions that they recorded in the present instead of leaving the 'original' music and improving the quality. I, personally cannot stand that. Especially on the songs that we were raised with. I want to hear the song as it was, not as they think it should sound now. There have been some great songs by artists ruined because of this. This set keeps that in mind. They improve the sound quality and make those hits sound excellent. Good job !"
A1BHNI68XZ06P6,B00CQGU9GG,5.0,"If you're in love with great music as I am, then this collection of axx kicking music will keep you smiling and eternally young.  Only 'flaw' I saw is the Fandango art  (no blimp shot of the stadium crowd) isn't exactly like the copy I grew up with (maybe I had a fancy version and never knew it?).  Everything's awesome... what a collection... GET IT !!!!  Cheap cheap cheap and a TON of the best music ever made by any three piece."
A30PGMDIGWO7M4,B00CQUNQFS,5.0,Great songs.  My daughter and son love listening to all the tracks!  Good times for long trips in the van.  Beats The wiggles!
A2NG313A8LTHS9,B00CQUNQFS,1.0,"The cliff notes version review of this would be that a bunch of kids try to sing one song, Ho Hey, and then a bunch of garbage produced by about three produces. But Ho Hey, the formula works so keep it up.This series is a disaster on so many levels. I have a couple really awesome kids and thankfully they can't stand today's pop music just like their Dad. My kids grew apart from average early, which is natural when your Dad is the frontman for asschowder. I may not be the best Dad at times, but shielding them from the mess that is out there right now is something that I'm proud of. There are so many awful \"songs\" on this thing outside of the Lumineers, but I'll choose to focus on a couple.Suit and Tie is just a great song for the kids. Let me quote a few of my favorite lines that are just wonderful for the 5-12 year old set- I'll be on my suit and tie, let me show you a few things (Hey Daddy, we is he going to show?)- I can't wait til I get you on the floor good looking (Clearly a dancing reference I guess)- Aww, go on and show 'em who you call Daddy (Yes sweetie, he is talking about his daughter)I'd rather just not take on those questions from my 7 year old at this point.Feel this moment is just an awful song. I really didn't even know it was a pitbull song because I really think it is 75% Christina Aguilera barking out the same refrain over and over and over. I get it, you want to feel this moment. The song was put together to be used for sporting events and advertising over the next 15 years. The perfect textbook pop machine hit.Don't stop the party is another fine message. As another reviewer said, nothing beats wanting the kids to party like pitbull, especially the little ones. You can expose them to an \"artist\" that sounds exactly the same on every song. No one should ever listen to pitbull for any reason, but he makes it impossible to escape him. If you watch sports, you will see pitbull. If you watch prime time tv, you will hear pitbull. Stupid Miami based trendy lyrics and a hook that just comes around over and over, exactly what you want your kids to learn.I don't blame razor & tie, they have found a brilliant hook. It's really not their fault that we may be at the lowest point since the late 70s in terms of popular music. The music has no soul and is making millionaires out of talentless hacks that have good dance beats behind them. The saddest part about this series is that some kids are going listen to this stuff and dream of becoming a future part of the problem. Give your kids some Mumford & Sons, Ed Sheeran or Natalie Merchant to give them a chance. I'd say to let your kids listen to Asschowder, but they aren't ready. The punk alt polka plus mindblowing lyrics are somethings they just aren't ready for until at least age 17."
A3BHF6RKMGW8D4,B00CRDKQM0,5.0,"I'll keep it short. Like many, I have been listening to FLA for many, many years. Again they are able to take their music in another direction while retaining their core essence. When I want the 'Plasma Spring' it's there. Feeling 'Maniacal?' Covered. And right now, 'Exhale' is happily inducing adrenaline. Which reminds, pity FLA wasn't involved in the Mechwarrior Online ST. Ahh well.'Echogenetic:' A+"
AD8GVT0BQ7U81,B00CRDKQM0,4.0,"This is a decent release by the band, but I think they peaked with Caustic Grip.  At least the metal guitar work is kept to a minimum."
A2CZYSQQYM1WD2,B00CRRCEBM,5.0,"Without Eric in the band it does sound a bit different but that isn't a bad thing I loved trouble from Psalm 9 on up but this album is great maybe not quite as good as Simple mind condition but a great follow up and this singer is amazing he sounds nothing like Eric but I find that refreshing that they didn't try to replace Eric with a clone, I like the power of this man's voice it's a great fit and I can't wait on the next album."
A3UYETCMY6Y1JZ,B00CRRCEBM,3.0,Love Trouble but without Eric Wagner and his distinct vocals this is just an average Metal album.  Sorry fans but it's just not the same.
A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B00CRS2TL6,5.0,"These jazz etudes with clever and insightful titles are splendid, and careful listening to musician interactions, especially role-changing, increases the pleasure. It is an atypical piano jazz trio lacking a drummer, so the piano of Carla Bley often takes the task of rhythm. There is a bassist, Steve Swallow, but in truth he plays an electric bass guitar that is modulated into the treble, which makes it a baritone guitar. The third member is Andy Sheppard, who is the tenor and soprano saxophonist. Together, depending on the work, they respectively weave in and out of lead, harmony or counterpoint, and rhythm. The package notes are trademark ECM minimalism, with a photographic essay, production credits, and nothing else about the artists or the music. The music, however, is not the usual free jazz of the label but simply jazz, rich in variety, and expansively abstract. The second track, Vashkar, is a bolero of sorts whose rhythm comes from the bass/baritone while the saxophone swirls in improvisations. The three lakes after art of Matisse, appropriately taken from his abstract Jazz cut-out series, suggest respectively a wind-churned surface via the boogie-like bassline, a serene and placid surface in the warmth of day, and a play of light and shadow with a bouncy arrangement. [Musically and graphically from the particular pieces.] The three forms of Wildlife are of a bluesy ballad, a springy dance, and repeating fluttering calls. The Girl Who Cried Champagne is an ambiguous title. Perhaps it is a romance, in which champagne is a metaphor for sweet tears, and where the music brings to mind a nightclub and city lights with the sophisticated lady foxtrotting, then slow dancing after midnight, and finally returning home in a Monkish walk in the sunny morning. Or it is about a boozy girl who digs champagne. This album offers much in the art of jazz, and the musicians have made an outstanding opus."
A2WXVAY473ST5N,B00CS9NKQW,5.0,This is a top rate gospel CD.  We absolutely love it. It's a good mix of old and new songs.
A1V4VVBQBFXRHC,B00CSCIZRI,1.0,"I'm sorry, but this CD is simply a means of paying the Campbell bills. There is one song that is really nice, but the rest are pretty bad. I'm sorry if Glen has squandered his wealth throughout the years and I'm sorry to see him suffering from such a terrible disease. But Glen has lived a live most will never realize. I give him cudos for having the courage to go public with his disease, most simply fade away and die in peace. I have always enjoyed his music for most of his entire career. However, Glen is not Glen any longer and he really should spend his remaining days catering to spending his life with family. This CD really isn't worth the money, unless your intent is to help the family that has earned hundreds of millions of dollars with their financial problems. Sorry Glen, I'm saddened to see the end of a great era for such a fantastic musician and country artist."
A75KTBJ4A1F4A,B00CSCIZRI,4.0,"I know others have raved about it, but I think his last two (Meet Glen Campbell and Ghost On The Canvas) far outshine this.  It sounds like what it is - outtake versions in the main of his past hits, reworked.  Having said that it's pretty good.  Nowhere near as the Johnny Cash American Recordings series, but still and all, a dignified and interesting final curtain to his career."
A264MKYFJOXDAO,B00CSCIZRI,5.0,It's sentiment that caused me to buy this CD. I love the music and the man. He has a life story that all should take note of in how we live this one life we have.
A1DRUTJB8KKDF1,B00CSCIZRI,3.0,"Having been pleasantly surprised by Meet Glen Campbell in 2008 and then again again by Ghost on the Canvas in 2011, I can only be disappointed in this effort. Meet Glen Campbell, Glen's CD of covers is a desert island disc and Ghost on the Canvas is not far behind, although completely different.I was looking forward to this disc, but can only say I am disappointed. Not that there's anything wrong with it, there is just nothing that it adds to Glen's huge catalog.The recording is intentionally sparse with Glen's voice at the forefront. However, there is nothing to keep your attention.As a huge Glen Campbell fan since the 60's, I was not wanting to write this review. Buy Meet Glen Campbell (with the bonus songs) or Ghost on the Canvas with your money.Of course, can't move forward without wishing Glen the best in his fight against Alzheimer's."
A3NIZVUYSVOGX1,B00CSCIZRI,5.0,I love music and enjoy playing this CD when I doing my bookwork!!!Not lucky like my sister to see him in person!
A2J6XZPU9DRGJB,B00CTCI2UM,3.0,Not exactly covering all the background singers in all areas and genres. Too much emphasis on one style and certain people.
AIM1A1HIA6TAD,B00CTEV72U,5.0,"I had this Odyssey LP and it's good to see it now on CD with the original jacket notes. True, it would've been nice of Sony to have added more material since CDs hold about twice what an LP could. But the trend today seems to be \"original jackets\" which also means original playing times of 30-40 min (or less). Still a highly recommendable release especially with junk like Netrebko filling today's shelves. Here is a REAL Verdi soprano. Grab it!"
A3CA2RTFXDMC2V,B00CTEV72U,5.0,"This is a very easy review.  This is a great recording by a great soprano in her prime.  We opera lovers and vocal recital collectors have waited a long time for this release.1) Steber is in great voice.2) Steber is a great voice.  She was a \"utilitarian\" soprano for the Met and probably was underappreciated and surely underrecorded.  When I say utilitarian I mean it in Steber's case as a compliment.  She had a sound that was bigger than a lyric; yet, not quite a dramatic.  She was a true \"lyrico spinto.\"  Another great American soprano Leontyne Price was also a true Spinto like Steber and it is interesting to see how much repertoire they shared.3) Steber could and did sing almost everything and exceedingly well.  Mozart, Verdi, Strauss, Wagner, Puccini... you get the picture!4) I like the sound on this CD Remastering.  It's cleaned up and it needed to be.  I pulled out my old Columbia/Odssey Lp and this new remastering clears up some compression, muddy mid-range, and strident and shrill highs.5) We the listener get ERNANI, DON CARLO, FORZA, TRAVIATA and OTELLO.  All beautifully vocalized and interpreted.6) We also get the Otello Love Duet and later Confrontation Duet with Ramon Vinay; also in excellent voice.7) Don,t miss this classic recording of a great American Diva.8) Let us have her Mozart album next. PLEASE!"
A11XAIFA10G7TS,B00CTX6EUG,5.0,"I have noticed over the years that a singer does well on American Idol but when their CD comes out, it appears they have been \"handled\" and lose what made them interesting and unique.  Their look is polished up and the album seems like many other album being produced today with over-done everything.  I hate that an artist I came to love is no longer recognizable to me and has lost their \"something special\".Fortunately, with Candice Glover, that doesn't appear to have happened.  I do think that an entire album of love songs is a bit much and would have liked lyrics beyond \"I love you and you left me\", but what is here is good.  Her voice is given the opportunity to shine with simple accompaniments being the rule rather than the exception.  She is at her best when the voice is front and center and the piano/guitar/other acoustical instrument is in the background and compliments rather than overpowers. That has largely been accomplished here.Some of the tracks I like better than others which isn't unusual but there is only one track I dislike enough to punch the skip button.  Most are very, very good and I find a couple of the tracks circulating in my head throughout the day.  Track 4 is that way and I find myself hearing the song and her lovely voice even when not actually listening to the music.I would probably give the album a high 4-stars, but since she has managed to release an album that actually sounds like her, I have to give a bonus star for that alone.  I don't know how much control she had over this, but someone, somewhere (and maybe Candice herself) did something right.  Loved her from the beginning of the season and I am so very happy to be able to listen to her gorgeous voice at will."
A1UIAARQ4VZZ75,B00CTX6EUG,4.0,Lovely voice; I would have preferred a broader range of music styles. Not my usual style but I actually liked the songs. this is due in large part to her gifted vocals. Please don't pigeon-hole this talented performer.
AK0L7D6GAZG4Q,B00CTX6EUG,3.0,I loved her on Idol.. I really don't care for the choice of songs on this album.. if they would have put all the songs she sang on Idol I would have loved it.. I thought they could have done a lot better... she has such a beautiful voice ... I still love her and maybe her next album she can pick the songs.. I will buy her next album.. and hope the songs will suit her better.. love you Candice.. I will keep listening and hoping you will put out that perfect album..
A2DW088P03Z3OF,B00CU8OVIM,3.0,It's like 98 on this album. No club bangers or something you would bump in your car but it is Hip-Hop not Rap.
A184UT64OE1AWQ,B00CU8OVIM,5.0,PRODUCTION: 6/8VOCALS: 6/8CONTENT: 8/8ENJOYMENT: 6/8GRADE: B+Nicely put together album with relevant tracks and a friendly appealPROS- nice concept and a nice collection of tracks- solid and consistent production; a nice even atmosphere- more than solid lyrical performances with introspective and on point flowCONS- tracks are a bit soft
A19XUGMN0Z7ZRR,B00CU8OVIM,5.0,"Let me just start by saying \"Forbidden Fruit\" is my favorite track off the album.I Honestly dont have a top 5 cause i truly love the whole album,only song i skip sometimes is \"Born Sinner\" (featuring @Fauntleroy) cause its slow,and my mood doesnt call for that tempo track,but still a good song,deep in meaning.Musically:ProductionThe production is great,very on point.In the last 2 years its easy to see Cole has learned a lot to progress his production skills. Their arent many,very few & far between MC's who can produce their music on a high level and it carry an album ,which is very impressive. He is the kanye west of my era(im 20 yrs old btw,grew up on Ye,and 90's raps as well).Lyrics: ContentThe content is impressive,well thought out concepts,inspiration,temptation,struggle and self struggle. Lyrically he has grown,once again easy to spot once the first track Villuminati plays.5 stars,9.5 out of 10 easily for me,best album ive heard since kendrick lamars \"Good kid m.a.a.d. city\""
A1D6HK21UH1163,B00CU8OVIM,5.0,"Jay Cole will be KING one day! His last album was great this album is 10 steps closer to the thrown. Amazing artist, Amazing album and Jay Z is just keeping the thrown warm until he hangs it up and it's in my opinion going to go to Cole or Kendrick."
A3Q26PN7A63Z6T,B00CU8OVIM,3.0,I've known about Cole for a while but this is the first album of his i've bought. Lyrically he is one of the best in the game. Each song he hits you with some real talk in a very smart way. The problem for the album is the production. Its not that every song has to be a club banger but they mostly have the same flow and tone from one song to the next. On the ocassions where he didn't produce a track you notice by how different it sounds. I hear his first album and mixtapes are better so i think i'll check them out. As far as this album goes its top notch lyrics with weak production
A3H226O1XUDWVV,B00CU8OVIM,5.0,He definitely won't let Nas down with this one. One of my favorite albums of the year. I hope he slowly starts changing the game like he wants. I'm getting sick of all these guys just rapping about how much money they have or how many women they get with. It's not clever anymore. Thanks J. Cole for putting your heart into this.
A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B00CU8OVIM,4.0,"J. Cole made the release date of June 18, 2013 even sweeter by releasing his highly anticipated effortBorn Sinner (Deluxe Edition)the same day as Kanye West and Mac Miller's new efforts.  While West'sYeezus [Explicit] is receiving the most buzz, perhaps J. Cole should be receiving equal, if not more 'love'.  Born Sinner is an exceptional follow-up to J. Cole's debut effort,Cole World: The Sideline Story, one of 2011's best album.  Intellectual and bold throughout, Cole's lyricism shows growth; he was already 'killing it'.\"Villuminati\" opens, chocked full to the brim with allusions and brainy rhymes.  It may be a bit heady to open, but it successfully shows Cole's skill.  Criticizing what Cole considers falsehoods of televangelism (and perhaps the church itself) is \"Kerney Sermon (Skit)\", in which pastor Kerney Thomas advertises a Prayer Package meant to 'heal' hardships, etc.  He follows up the skit with \"Land of the Snakes\", a cut in which he reminisces on his past, particularly his own hardships and a regrettable one-night stand.  Remaining focused, Cole does not disappoint in the least.  On the ubiquitous promo single \"Power Trip\",  Cole continues to impress, as he suggests his girl has \"Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs...\" Overt about his feelings, Cole claims \"...this has gotta be the longest crush ever...\" while his partner in crime Miguel just 'wants you to want him.'  After the love is gone, \"Mo Money (Interlude)\" proceeds, with J. Cole rapping about his previous lack of money and his 'come up'.If \"Mo Money\" causes problems, then the superb \"Trouble\" is the reaction and effect.  The MC is all about real talk, accompanied by a relatively simple buttressing beat and a soulful sounding gospel choir.  On \"Runaway\",  Cole claims \"The devil got his hands on me...\", again alluding to his sins/vices, which seem to be women, as he brags about the 'notches on his belt' compared to teen heartthrob Justin Bieber.  His issues continue on \"She Knows\", featuring Amber Coffman, in which he alludes to MLK, Jr.'s 'womanizing,' going so far to acknowledge Coretta's knowledge of it.  Maybe it's insensitive, but as Cole suggests at the beginning of the album, \"it's way darker this time.\"  He's angered on \"Rich N****\" claiming hardship will make you do things you don't want to or shouldn't do.  He misses choir practice on \"Where's Jermaine? (Skit)\", only to partake of the \"Forbidden Fruit\" with standout colleague, Kendrick Lamar.  Jazzy, magical, and completely distinct compared to his previous work, \"Forbidden Fruit\" begs for repeated listens.On \"Chaining Day\", while the 'obvious' impropriety that Cole raps about is his overindulgence for Jesus pieces, the bigger picture is materialism in general.  While he claims his current Jesus piece is his last, he 'back steps' on \"Ain't That Some S***\" (\"OK I lied...\"), in which he commits every perceived sin he can.  Cole criticizes the country on \"Crooked Smile\" (featuring TLC), suggesting it's a \"crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten\".  He wishes to please his favorite MC, Nas, but has \"Let Nas Down\" in the past, something he details on one of the effort's 'tour de forces'.  He quasi-repents for his mistakes on \"Born Sinner\", in which he \"...never got to church to worship lord, but please be merciful...\" Unlike some deluxe versions, the deluxe edition of Born Sinner is well worth the extra monetary investment, particularly for standout \"New York Times\" featuring 50 Cent and Bas.Ultimately, don't sleep onBorn Sinner (Deluxe Edition).  It is a superb effort through and through with no misses of note.  There are more than enough 'standouts' to justify purchasing it - it's that good.  Dark, wise, and enjoyable, this is a great addition to any rap music collection. 4 stars."
A2PCNX59G2GLIM,B00CU8OVIM,5.0,"I'm gonna say this Yeezus is by far the worst album I ever heard in my 24 years of living with that being said I listened to Born Sinner and was surprised at J. Cole for his second LP there are some great songs on here, as well as the production my favorite is \"Rich N......\" That song is pure fire, I also like the samples on this album like \"Forbidden Fruit\" feat K. Dot was pretty good being that they sampled ATCQ \"Electric Relaxation\" another song that was sampled was \"Da Art Of Story Telling Pt. 1\" by OutKast which Mr. Cole titled \"Land Of The Snakes\" which also is a favorite of mine \"Let Nas Down\" was a standout on the album that guy who is playing the saxophone needs a raise because that was beautiful those are just some of my favorites songs no need for a long speech just go get the album support J. Cole not Kanye West."
A1FJVIIL3SENF2,B00CU8OVIM,4.0,"J.Cole will never get into that elite level until he lets someone else make a beat for him. All the beats sounds the same to me, and it pisses me off that I know he has more potential but he is in that comfort zone of making beats for himself. I cant give him 5 stars on this album honestly, not even close to Kanye as far as production but every album he is getting better"
AGK58PGAXTDM5,B00CUIVGZS,5.0,"I've seen Chick Corea perform more times than I can remember at this point. The man is just relentless when it comes to putting out quality music on stage, or in the studio. Whether he's performing with Stanley Clarke, Al Di Meola, Jean Luc Ponty or just solo...it stands to reason that Chick Corea is a virtuoso musician who never fails to amaze. His latest effort on The Vigil is no exception. Looking at the cover art, I had no idea what to expect because it just looks overly grandiose. I actually chuckled to myself, thinking Chick may have finally lost his mind! Luckily, I quickly discovered that the music within is sublime, complex and demanding of repeat listens. A true artist is always evolving his or her sound, while maintaining their original foundation. Chick Corea must be a true artist then, and I'm hoping he continues to release wonderful music."
ALQ12GYW884EJ,B00CUIVGZS,5.0,"The Vigil is the new band of Chick Corea, but in the cover of the CD, Corea himself say \"We have been doing it for a long time, just gave it a new name(for now), \"The Vigil\". In fact there is nothing new but you can find in the same album difference approach to the same music. The two first pieces; Galaxy 32 Star 4 and Planet Chia are part of the last period of CBS albums of Return to forever. \"Portals to forever\" is more jazz in classical style. \"Royalty\" is more \"Captain Marvel\", the first period of Corea band. \"Outside of Space\" is a typical soft ballad with his wife Gayle Moran . \"Pledge for Peace\" is probably the best part of the album. In this live recording play Ravi Coltrane and Stanley Clarke, 18 minutes of pure music, fantastic. The last one is \"Legacy\" a homenage to legacy of the greatest composer of jazz.Conclusion; a great album with different Coreas, and the beginning of a new adventure. Tim Garland on sax, Charles Altura on electric and acoustic guitar , Hadrien Feraud on bass, Marcus Gilmore on drums are The Vigil. After years you can find a \"new\" record in the same spirit of Return to Forever. If you like RTF don't miss this experience"
A1JETXMSDZZBZD,B00CUIVGZS,5.0,"Together with fantastic album cover of a romantic warrior in the galaxy, the Vigil presents us the most exiting music Chick Corea has ever created during his career, with eloquent expression constantly changing from bop to fusion/funk. First four tunes are energetic children of forever, which evoke the sound of the &#8217;70s RTF. Chick Corea speaks of the Vigil band as the confluence of artistic spirit outside of time and space, no regard for age and experience. Chick seems to be once again looking forward to the future, after ample years of looking back projects.&#8220;Planet Chia&#8221; starts with the notes reminding of the &#8220;Crystal Silence,&#8221; and soon transforms it&#8217;s atmosphere into latin touch flavor. Featured Charles Altura sends out idyllic transparent guitar sound. He creates a familiar Pat Metheny sound in &#8220;Royalty,&#8221; which fixes the image of the tune. The feel of &#8220;Legacy&#8221; is quite opposite to the connotation of the word. Marcus Gilmore&#8217;s drum sound overflows the listening room. Every players make aggressive sounds powerfully, which becomes my best track in this album. &#8220;Pledge for Peace&#8221; starts in the unmistakable Coltrane sound, which is Chick&#8217;s interpreted version of &#8220;Love Supreme.&#8221; Chick shows McCoy Tyner like piano touch through the sheets of sound rumbles. Stanley Clarke reels off thumping bass sound as if he is singing a word, Lo&#8212;Ve&#8212;Su&#8212;Preme. Ravi Coltrane successfully reproduces his father&#8217;s tone in good health.In the last September the Vigil band performed one night stand at the Tokyo Jazz. Although they played only three tunes within one hour performance, they produced high quality of aesthetic communication, competence and chosen emotion throughout the show. Bassist Carlitos Vel Puerto and percussionist Luis Quintero were replaced to the original album members. The stage began with &#8220;Tempus Fugit,&#8221; the tune recalled Miles Davis in the Blue Note era. &#8220;Portals to Forever&#8221; started with the atmosphere like &#8220;Ife.&#8221; The moment appeared his homage to Miles. &#8220;Galaxy 32 Star 4&#8221; was extended into more than 30 minutes version. Chick took control of the flow while pushing soloist affectionately, every his action during the play reminded me of the late Miles himself. Chick and band members&#8217; interplay were like those between mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. He trained the band members through the live performances like Miles. Impatient for the next album."
A2OXU3ON08Q6AU,B00CUKTG2Q,4.0,"More of the same music as expected, overall, satisfied with the new album. If you like this album, I recommend all their previous albums."
A3QIC8EUUVCQUL,B00CV1P9J8,5.0,"I've followed the career of Battlecross for well over a decade as the core of Tony Asta and Hiran Deraniyagala have weathered all manner of trials. I became a fan when I saw their dedication to craft, showmanship and their iron resolve: It was music or die trying. Having finally assembled like-minded souls, this CD resonates with the force of a collaborative explosion. After hearing this CD, I am a fan because of their talent, virtuosity, song-writing, CD-composition ~and~ all of the above.Specifically, there are 2 guitar bridges that utterly leap out: \"Flesh & Bone\" @ 1:50 and \"Get Over It\" @ 3:50. Totally cool, harmonized riffs, that come from nowhere, sonically surprising, showcasing sublime musical know-how. The guitars' tones are amazing and, yes, they duplicate this live.The guitar solo in 'Never Coming Back' is just sick, crazy awesome. These boys don't try to create heart-pounding, storm-trooping, machine-gun rhythms: they SUCCEED. This is hard-jamming, classy metal, the way previous generations of musicians have only aspired to perform. You can just feel the energy and joy as their hard-work at attaining guitar virtuosity has climbed well beyond their original vision. Now they perform these technically demanding songs with ease. The whole CD was recorded in a month. There is no pretense, no straining, no bumbling around grasping for a \"cool\" rhythm. It's just ~there~ on nearly every second of this album.I would be remiss if I didn't single out \"Beast\" as my favorite. It is a dark, brooding piece, with weird minor, chromatic steps that create an awesome atmosphere -- kind of like you're taking a relaxing, gondola trip with Charon. The rhythms here are the cleverest and unique on the CD."
A2MPOC42G4SN06,B00CV1PD8A,5.0,"I discovered these guys because they're going out on Rockstar Mayhem and thought I'd check them out. Did not like the EP, sound was primitive. I even streamed the preview of the CD and didn't really like it. When it was released I got an ad and previewed it on iTunes where it's good quality and you get a 1:30 preview. I decided to buy it and have somehow really gotten into it. I've even been listening to it at the gym. Now I'm looking forward to checking them out live next week."
A3RVNRMTIBCU7M,B00CV1PD8A,4.0,"Bought this CD in anticipation of their performance at this year's Mayhem Fest and it was better than expected. If you like heavy, female-fronted bands like Kittie, this is up your alley."
A2OK8KEFI6F6HK,B00CVB6SV6,1.0,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I refuse to accept that this album exists...And that Stephen is on the Dubstep bandwagon...I did not see this, i did not see this, i did not see this..."
A283G1M7W78MWZ,B00CVB6SV6,1.0,This is like breaking the finger off a 600-year-old statue. Or painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Just no excuse. Jeez.
A19TDFMOV4468X,B00CVB6THE,5.0,"As always, an excellent output by Ms. India.Arie. This is a good-feeling and positive sounding album throughout. It invites and welcomes me into her world all the way through. She has always had a way of relating to the human condition through her music. This time, she wants us to go forth perked up, ready to deal and unstressed as possible. Unfazed by any manufactured controversy that may have surrounded the first single, Cocoa Butter, India comes off as golden as she looks in that wonderful picture in most of these songs. And from my POV in the PDF booklet, she is golden!Automatic standouts:This Love. I think this sounds experimental actually, with the haunting echoes of the chorus and the electronic sounds throughout. Also has a slight hip-hop feel. But it really works. \"NEVER GIVE IT UP!\" is my favorite part. It's probably the only song that deals in part with hardship and conveys that. But from here on out, be prepared to be filled with pleasant thoughts.Flowers: Beautiful piano, but check out that string/horn/whatever wonderful section that follows \"give you your flowers now.\" So great.We already know the beauty of Cocoa Butter.Break The Shell and SoulBird Rise both start out slowly but build up to be nice anthems of empowerment. And yet they still carry the gentleness of India's music (especially SoulBird's ending). Then they get followed up by some more upbeat songs in Thy Will Be Done (diggin' the reggae and she needs to keep working with Gramps Morgan, they are wonderful together) and Brothers' Keeper. Are you seeing something in these song titles? They radiate positivity. India has not strayed from what has kept her in this business for 12 years.One invites all to listen to her music regardless of affiliation or the like. It's a fantastic ending, and I actually prefer this ending than any of the four bonus tracks, although they are all wonderful in their own right (my favorite of those would have to be Thank You).That's SongVersation in a nutshell. Whatever was troubling India that allowed her to write some deeply personal and dealing with hardship songs on her past two albums seems to have gone away because she is feelin' good, paying tribute to others, and wanting to make us feel good with simple, elegant melodies. If there were a qualm to the album, it would only be that the middle part has more simple arrangements that don't automatically pop out. But that requires you to listen more, which is never a problem with Ms. India. Personally, I'd rather have that than a clearly manufactured top 40 pop hit.I still need to give it a few more spins, but I already knew I'd be happy with my purchase. I give it 5 stars because I now have an album in whic I want to listen to every little detail that is contained within."
AXN2IO1UBOF6A,B00CVB6THE,1.0,This cd is so boring I fell a sleep on it all songs to me are just to slow and I didn't like the music arrangement to me not one good song would I buy from this
A1CD77DIYT342C,B00CVB6THE,5.0,Music for the soul.  I could listen to this cd all the time.  I hope she knows this about her music.
A1HCCW38EQQBTY,B00CVB6THE,5.0,"With this release, India.Arie has proven that she marches to the strings of her own guitar, and she plays it very well!  With this release, I just popped it into my car disc player and I drove, while her voice just soothed me.  The songs ran the gamut, from love to her ode to the armed forces, to spirituality, to just about everything.  This disc stayed in my player for three spins straight. She is the type of artist who is on a totally different tip when it comes to creating music, and it shows in her body of work. She made the money that I spent on the deluxe version worth it.  She is so blessed to be so talented, and we are blessed to have heard it!"
A3U0HH4J5DCLHI,B00CVB6THE,4.0,"So happy she branched out!  Love this effort; hope she does more, especially with the Indan influence in the music."
AURRFEI0X9JR2,B00CVB6THE,3.0,"lots of overcoming songs.  has an overall dated feeling to me.  I was hoping she would go in some new direction, maybe add a little jazz or something."
A1E93U2VRL4UO7,B00CVB6THE,5.0,"This is a very uplifting and inspiring album.  We've waited since 2009 for India to release new music and it was definitely worth the wait! Just Do You is a wonderful way to start out the album. I liked all the songs on here, but some other tracks that stood out to me include:FlowersCocoa ButterThy Will Be DoneThank YouSoul Bird RiseI feel that this album is one of her best album's to date. I highly recommend that you add this album to your collection. The deluxe edition includes 4 more songs. The album is long, about an hour, but it's definitely worth a listen!"
ADDAPWAZXUI1U,B00CVB6THE,2.0,"India left me hangin' with this project.  Her lyrics and messages are deep and moving, however, the music was missing.  Her remake of Strange Fruit was on point and riveting, bringing the memory of Billie Holiday's presentation of this song to mind and how it was received during her time.  I really appreciate that about India Arie and her music, how she infuses history and self awareness in her musical presentation, but I think she got more caught up in the writing of lyrics than the writing of music on this CD."
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00CVB6V22,3.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this CD after purchasing it on a recommendation of a friend. From first track to the last, the music was a delight to listen to."
ASGPXFE7JWOD1,B00CVB6V22,5.0,"Love this band! I could go on and on about them, but I say listen for yourself you will come to love this band just as much as I do. This arrived on time and in perfect condition."
AML9JRK4SP222,B00CW3E8E2,5.0,"Another solid album from Tech.  I wasn't the biggest fan of 6's and 7's, but he came back strong with this one."
A1WGUNGPYRR4TI,B00CW3E8E2,5.0,"Tech just kills it on this record.  Serj Tankian does a beyond epic job on \"Party The Pain Away\".  I have listened to this album now twice and I'd say my favorite song is \"So Dope\".  I loved Tech since I first heard \"Imma Tell\" and have loved his music ever since.  He had a few downfall moments, but every artists has those.  EBAH was a masterpiece EP, but Boiling Point was a huge bust.  But then Tech releases this album and I love ever track except \"Fragile\".  Typically I will absolutely love about 5 or 6 tracks per album, but this one, Fragile is the only one I don't like.  Tech, you have really outdone yourself, and made up for every fault you have ever made musically.  I tip my hat to you sir, this album will be a cult classic!!!"
AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B00CW3E8E2,5.0,"Tech N9ne's Something Else is a fantastic, creative album. The album is worth listening to from start to finish to really absorb the concept and execution. Tech N9ne delivers every song with his wicked, untouchable flow. The production delivers a unique sound where every song is sonically consistent yet distinguishable; the productions is really fantastic and compliments the vocals of all participating artists. On that point, the features are able to keep up with Tech N9ne -- Serj Tankian is killer, Krizz Kaliko is stunning with his powerful vocals and flow, Snow Tha Product is impressive, Cee-Lo Green is fantastic, and so on -- an impressive lineup for collaborations. But, Tech N9ne also shows he can hold songs down on his own with \"Fortune Force Field\" and \" Believe\".I enjoyed the entire album during my first listen. My favorite songs are: \"Straight Out The Gate\", \"Love 2 Dislike Me\", \"Fortune Force Field\", \"Fragile\", \"Priorities\", \"So Dope\", \"That's My Kid\", \"Meant to Happen\", \"Believe\", \"Drowning\", \"Thizzles\" and \"Feels Like Heaven\". The rest of the album is great, too, but these are the tracks that'll be on my mind for a very long time.With a hints of introspection, storytelling, spazzing and partying, Something Else is something for everyone. It's the work of a brilliant artist with a lot to give to his dedicated fan base. For fans of Tech N9ne, fans of his constant growth, and newcomers, this is a fantastic rap album. Oh, and I strongly recommend the All Access Edition, the bonus tracks are standouts."
AIDFLFUKJ657I,B00CW3E8E2,5.0,this is an excellent cd his style and beats are awesome. he carries on the proud tradition and keeps it hard and gangsta. keep the proud addition brotha. save rap for us ogs.
A26XVLPGC85CTD,B00CX7OU40,1.0,"I grew up listening to Travis Tritt & Marty Stuart among others during my younger years thanks to my uncle for providing me with a country side to my musical roots.  However this album is a total rip off ? Nothing has been re-recorded an if it is then only the vocals have been overdubbed.  Tritt add one new track to the album an that is it ? Really should have just released them on ITunes & other media download outlets b.c. other then \"Sometimes love just ain't enough,\" and the exclusive ITunes track \"Why Me Lord\" this album is nothing more then the album the Storm release several years ago now.  I honestly thought the ITunes & Amazon.com sample of the songs haven't yet been updated so I waited until today an sure enough the tracks are exactly the same.  Really Travis ? Really ? The Storm album wasn't any good when it was released in the first place so you re-release it with one or two new songs ?  The two new songs should have been placed on a four track ep with some other tunes an sold on the cheap instead of this garbage.I am really disappointed in this release heck I would have rather had a Live album from Travis with two new studio tracks from above on it instead of this re-release.  Plus the Storm album was one of Travis Tritt's worst efforts ever !  Do yourself a favor an buy a used copy of the Storm cheap an download the track from above wherever you want.  THEIR IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS RELEASE ! Unless you never bought a copy of the Storm an you just want the new artwork an the physical new album.Total disappointment ! Do not buy. PERIOD !"

A3RUY20LASCA6S,B00CX7OU40,2.0,"Maybe the problem for me was that this is the first CD from Travis that I have purchased in 15 years but, I was not impressed.  He sounds old. I was expecting to tap my feet like I did when he was on the &#34;No Hats&#34; tour.  There is very little to tap your feet to on this cd.  Don't misunderstand me, sounding old is not a problem.  George Jones began to sound old, too!!  However, he still captivated my attention.  Travis just does not do it for me on this cd."

A3QR0440G5DTYC,B00CYMHM3K,4.0,"A 4 star album if you compare it to Pills, Thrills and Bellyaches, Screamadelica and/or The Stone Roses, but why on earth would you do that? Truthfully, as someone who lived through that era and remains a great fan to those brilliant 3 albums, this doesn't really sound like any of them. It has echoes of the 'baggy' era, but only echoes. It's like comparing Tame Impala to The Beatles. Or OMD to Kraftwerk. As for taking this album on its own merits, it's fun, unique, dance oriented, funky. As for a modern comparison, I'd say Jagwar Ma is more in the Django Django family, shades of 1960's psychedelia updated for this century.  4.5 stars."

A4HU2DQ09O8FA,B00CZAYL76,3.0,"These last two albums have been more like pop metal, real quick sound good songs right off the bat that have little substance. After a few listens they become boring and I find myself moving on."
A1WGUNGPYRR4TI,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"To say the least, Five Finger Death Punch are on top of the world and are taking the metal world by storm!!  Ivan Moody had a lot of personal struggle through this one and was almost booted from the band.  But despite inner issues, EVERY track on this album is addicting to listen to.  It tripped me up on the track listing as three songs are done twice, but then I realized, the first ones were done by the band alone, the second set featured other artists.  FFDP just gets better and better with each album they make, and it's going to be quite tough to top this one. But it seems they will have no problem producing at least a few more masterpieces.  I doubt FFDP is going anywhere, any time soon!!  If you're a hard rock fan and a FFDP, this album is totally required to get!!"
AAM3O8FOE7BX3,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"They still rock. Hard to do these days. Unfortunately, I was a big fan of Disturbed, but they just seemed to &#34;run out of steam&#34; and couldn't do what 5FDP has, album after album. Thanks guys!"
A2YKU5ZJSDLREO,B00CZAYL76,3.0,"While I have been a fan of this band since way of the fist and even a fan of Ivan's earlier band motograter. Thought way of the fist was a great debut and war is the answer blew my mind. American capitalism came out it was good, had some great songs on there but I couldn't really get past the song that sort of sounded like nickleback. So 2013 rolls around and five finger is expected to come out with two albums three or four months apart from each other the first volume is out now gave it a little while to sink in and sort of digest the album. It's started to really grow on me it really rocks. It already rocks harder than the last album which it is a good thing. The only problem is some of the riffs and songs sound a lot the same. And I feel the lyrics are sort of dumbed down but delivered my Ivan always heart felt and with a lot of passion and anger. Zoltan guitar is stellar as always with a lot of face melting solos. A good metal album but you don't have to thing to hard to listen it to it. And I feel like their not really taking any chances and sort of playing it safe. But still a good head banging album just some of the same old same old going on!"
A1QDW09AD13JT6,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"FFDP and their newly anticipated release of \"The Wrong Side Of Heaven & The Righteous Side Of Hell\" hits on all cylinders...Pure Un-Adulterated Mayhem ;)"
AOIMVO7OJKNW8,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"I'll Make It Short And Sweet. The Best Album Of 2013. Hands Down. Beat The Hell Out Of American Capitalist. Most Bands Have That Time When They Seem Like They've Lost It And Well Kinda Suck, But Death Punch Gets Better And Better Each Album :) Get This One You Won't Regret It."
A2ASAU4Z0JJH2R,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"I did not want to do this. I've mocked this band since their inception. In fact, I stand by my assessment that Vol. II (released in the twilight of 2013) is everything I've come to expect from FFDP. However, I would be remiss if I didn't own up about my feelings toward Vol 1. This album is a triumph. There are so many amazing qualities here -- from visceral lyrics to blistering riffs -- that I don't even know where to start. Traditionally, FFDP has been too mainstream for my tastes, and Vol II certainly fits that bill. The thing is, Volume 1 us a giant among men. \"Diary of A Deadman\" is a brilliant composition all the way around. \"M.I.N.E\" is perhaps the most relevant guttural acknowledgement of human suffering ever written. And yes, I'll admit it. I loathe remakes, but \"Mama said knock you out\" is a very fun listen. This is a great album. Don't feel guilty when you like it. It's hard not to. This is how metal is supposed to be done."
A26533IAFWR68U,B00CZAYL76,5.0,"Was on the fence with this band....liking the few songs played on Sirius Octane...their cover of Bad Company was an attractant...but when I heard them interviewed on the same station, heard some more songs, and listened to the banter,  something clicked so I used a coupon for Amazon and downloaded this album.Listened to it for two days straight. Refurbished my deck, tore thru some landscaping and worked out till I dropped, literally, had noting left. The music drove me, and drove me...I've heard their live performances can be sketchy, but hope to see them on their next go round in the NYC area.Get this album, and get to work!PS - the cover of Momma Said was a real nice sonic surprise...removing all the silliness and throttlng up the beat and missing guitars of the original. Kudos FFDP! This is what a cover is supposed to be, different and a little hard to recognize."
A3AKS9X8SREFMP,B00CZAYLS0,5.0,"Awesome release for those that want what was to become ELECTRIC (previously released as THE MANOR SESSIONS but only as a 5 track EP). Wild Flower is considerably different. LRM has elements of several songs in it, including a guitar run that would later be used in Sun King. Aphrodisiac Jacket and Zap City, The Cult's greatest song ever, are by far the best tracks on PEACE.Oh and Love Trooper and Conquistador as well."
AU5R8CU9J5OGQ,B00D1H9D2K,3.0,I get it. It isn't a Bon Iver record. It has its moments where it starts to stand out and feel strong but then it basically wanes. I like it a lot....I just do not LOVE it.
ATLS4WXCVXDVE,B00D1H9D2K,4.0,"Good:Justin Vernon put together a cool group and they put together an album that is pushing genre boundaries and changing things up.  There are several great moments on the album.A warning:If you're looking for a continuation of what you loved about Bon Iver, Bon Iver, this is probably not it.  The sparseness that you loved about that album is definitely not here - this is more of a collaboration with lots of different people.  That means a lack of sparseness and also a lack of the singular voice that defined Bon Iver, Bon Iver.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, which is why I didn't title this section &#34;bad:&#34; but it is something to be aware of."
A2E1LTSDJXENY9,B00D28TNT6,5.0,"I bought this on vinyl and I sat mesmerized for the first half of the album, then flipped it over and was actually sad when it was over. I wanted more, like a drug addict, I needed more!This music will tell you a story, take you places, but you must really listen to hear the layers of sonic beauty. From the outside this might sound like noise to some, but once you settle in its beautiful and uplifting.This is not what I would call background party music, it must be listened to. Headphones or speakers, park yourself and enjoy."
A38IRL0X2T4DPF,B00D2I8E28,2.0,Costello has always covered a lot of musical territory but most of this doesn't even sound like him. He's singing in a low voice most of the way through and it all just seems too cool. The fact that the drums are way too loud doesn't help. Some of the arrangements are interesting but a remix is badly needed.
AGRHEXZ7D0PGD,B00D2I8E28,4.0,"I have been a fan of Elvis Costello since he broke out onto the scene with his Buddy Holly look and alternative rock sound in 1977 with My Aim Is True.  While I don&#8217;t claim to be an expert on all of the musical directions that he has pursued in his long and varied career, some of which have not worked as well as others, I have always respected his willingness to collaborate with musicians from different genres and create new musical spaces for himself.  This collaboration with The Roots, who are consummate musicians with a killer R&B/hip hop/funk groove, works very well and inspires a lot of repeat listens.  Both his lyrics and vocals provide a nice combination of in your face attitude and restraint.  Highly recommended for fans of both Elvis and The Roots as well as anyone who likes funky music with an edge."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00D2I8E28,2.0,"got a chance recently to sit and hear this album between Costello and the  Roots and the sentiment was  some things are either best left to just doing them on  the  tv show or best left to the cutting room floor period.  no songwriting here that goes anywhere and it just feels and sounds like  a jam session flipped to sell a project and who benefits from it exactly? Elvis Costello to me was always a 2nd tier act at best who was more important to the critics, i could take or leave him The  Roots to me are more famous and known for playing behind other folks and to me they stay as the bridesmaids with their own music and i'm still waiting on them to make a Artistic statement to merit  the hype. this ain't it."
A36L3NRW858ROT,B00D2I8E28,5.0,"Elvis Costello is one of those artists that have been around for a long time.  Why?  He isn't afraid to expand.  To try different things.  He will perform in different genres just to, I imagine, expand his horizons.  He is not stuck in one place.This CD will take a couple of listens to get used to - but that is no reason not to have it - especially if you are Costello fan.  I will not go into a song by song breakdown, suffice to say that Mr. Costello puts it all out there.  It is a shame that we very rarely hear him on commercial radio."
A2RX1VW9QMMTSR,B00D2I8E28,3.0,The album cover is a reproduction of city lights books series called 'Pocket Poets'. Check out Allen Ginsberg's Howl and see it for yourself.
A3JASLW6AK06IT,B00D2I8E28,5.0,"My favorite thing about Elvis Costello is that he has never stopped experimenting and stretching, and this album fits that bill once again.  His plaintive voice and incredible lyrics (one of the great songwriters of the last 35 years) combine so well with the musical talents of The Roots that this is a no-lose album for fans of either Elvis or The Roots."
A3DPACNQCR3720,B00D2I8E3C,5.0,"I ordered this without hesitation when I was notified that it was coming out.  It is a very progressive endeavor to capture alot of those stray Sly songs into one location.  It was also a good move to add all the hits in 'mono' not that we needed that, but it will lure the 'Sly curious' listener to this set.Sly, producer for Autumn Records, an independent San Francisco record co (Beau Brummels) tried his hand at recording a few sides which never charted, but revealed that there was something different about this guy.  When he formed the Family Stone, that's when things stared to heat up.  A deal with Columbia produced a relatively quiet Debut, with a promising title \"A Whole New Thing\".  That wouldn't happen until their sophomore effort, \"Dance to the Music\".  The rest needs no repeating.This set offers 17 previously unreleased songs and perhaps 23 when you consider the Amazon bonus disc.  The idea that there are STILL more in the vault is fascinating.  And Sly's brother Freddy said that Sly is 'still making good music' in his own exile.Sly always said that he wanted to explore other non conventional ideas in music.  His idea to release Que Sera Sera' in a slow groove on Fresh was innovative.  And the live 'St James Infirmary' makes you wish that he had lead the Family into recording a jazz tinged album, like what happened with James Brown.The only complaint that I have is that when the set was offered as a download, it was less inexpensive than buying the physical box set, by 30 dollars.  But it is well worth it."
A3K9CT31OFXEG3,B00D2I8E4G,1.0,"Sampled it on Spotify, pretty much all the same pyrotechnics throughout. Absolutely horrible, a dreadful noise. Loud and fast doesn't count for a thing."
AZNH6NRP6PVYR,B00D2I8E4G,5.0,"It's a great album and the band seems to just get better and better with each new one they put out.  If you haven't already, give it a listen."
A3T19AW0GJVQN5,B00D2K2008,4.0,"This bargain set is distinguished from its rivals  by the drammatic tone taken by the principals, particularly the prima donna, Alex Penda. While she, Pizzolato, Osborne and Regazzo all deliver the bel canto goods and vocal fireworks, they are not mellifluous, elegant or full of finess. For that look elsewhere. But more than in any other totally complete every single note and then some version, this one packs a theatrical wollop. I still prefer tne DG with Studer, Larmore and Ramey under a driven but wayward Ion Marin, but this has been playing pretty constantly and repeatedly on my mp3 player, and the listening experience has been greatly satisfying."
A2MT3MUVMNBGVM,B00D2K20J4,4.0,"There's something kinda spooky about this record. Pokey sounds like he's channeling the hopes and dreams of my Okie relatives who rode the rail cars out to California in the 30's. At the same time, his songs resonate in 2013, when lots of folks are struggling to stay afloat. I like it better with each spin.The production is as rich and warm as a glowing vacuum tube in an old Magnavox radio. It's encouraging to see Jack White's label fostering real, handcrafted music like this. If you like Gillian Welch, early Andrew Bird and the Oh Brother soundtrack, you should dig Pokey LaFarge. Get the vinyl and cut a rug, baby!"
A37P3IV8758KUL,B00D2PIUAM,5.0,"The fact that Placebo is one of those bands that not only sticks around through the test of time; but they also get better with time.  Each new album they have is better written and better orchestrated to show the emotions of the lyrics through all their beautiful sounds that they create.  LLL is no difference.  Battle For The Sun kicked you in the teeth right off the bat and LLL does that, too.  This CD will get you fired up with some hard hitting songs.  It will get you reflecting on things with some of the more somber songs, like Too Many Friends.  This album has a song for every mood and like Placebo themselves, can be enjoyed by anyone from all over the world.  This CD is just fantastic and I'm so happy to have found a copy in America (Barnes and Noble).  I didn't wanna order it online as I didn't want to wait!"
A26DDRSI90CWS,B00D3AAJ5A,4.0,Viola Wills was one of those disco singers who was never outrageously big but still managed to leave us with a couple of memorable late disco classics - here I'm thinking of the wonderful disco remakes of Gonna Get Along Without You Now and If you could read my mind. These songs are well represented here with various remixes and bring back the disco memories of 12 inch versions of songs with loads of instrumental breaks where you just cruise along until the vocals start up again.  The surprise on this Best of collection is Viola's lesser known remakes of Secret Love and Up on the roof which are surprisingly good and helped along of course by Viola's accomplished and effortless vocals.  I was also interested to see the song Starry Eyed on this album having remembered it on the radio many years ago and not heard it since. it's a nice mid-tempo number well worth checking out. If you are into 70s disco music and want to  reconnect with its typical sound check this release out.
A3DUY3FHH21T3T,B00D3HYLP2,4.0,"I must say that skylar grey has really outdone herself here by releasing a very good new album, it's not really of the norm where i personally like today's acts but skylar will be that exception. I first discovered skylar when she released one or two of her tracks which was \"Dance Without  You\" and \"Invisible\" and felt she was new and unique especially in her sound of music which was being conveyed at the time and still hold's up to today. Skylar grey's music or her style i would describe it as more of an alt. pop style rather than a standard style of pop. On her second release \"don't look down\" she really starts off the album strong with 4 ballads \"Back from the dead\", \"Wear me out\", \"Religion\", and \"Final warning\" that set the tone for the album, however i do have to say i was a little bit disappointed that half way through the album the quality of the songs starts to dissipate but then picks up again for one more song then drops all together.Overall i would definitely recommend this album it's full of tales of tragedy, lies, betrayal and heartbreak as usual when it comes to females in the industry, i just wish they would stop subjecting women in music to this kind of pattern of releasing music like this although i'm somewhat kind of a sucker for this sorta music it does tend be tedious and counter productive on the fore front"
A2P8P8FI4PCGBI,B00D3HYLP2,4.0,"There are some great songs that draw on anger, betrayal, and just complicated situations.  The album is a little on the serious side until &#34;Cmon Let Me Ride&#34; comes on; What a fun song."
A2QB8GZ8P7Y2RD,B00D3HYMQK,4.0,"I can't believe Sick Puppies don't get that much hype still.  I like their music and this album is no exception.  They performed on my college campus years back and I'm glad that I discovered them.  There's No Going Back is a great song that was released as a single before the album.  I like the rock music that they still bring and great addition.It's worth noting that there is a Best Buy exclusive version of this album for $14.99.  It has 18 songs instead of the 12.  The bonus songs include What Are You Thinking, No Mercy, Better Waste of Time, There's No Going Back (Rock Version), There's No Going Back (Acoustic), Telling Lies (Leaked Bootleg).  I think it is well worth the extra money to grab the extra songs."
A1IBNDZ8MS5PYF,B00D3HYMQK,2.0,Their previous music is way way better...guess this is what happens when you find mild success in the business...blame it on the d@mn record companies.
A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B00D3HYMQK,4.0,"I became a fan of Sick Puppies after seeing them open once in a concert that included Breaking Benjamin and Shine Down, so I have looked forward to a new album since Tri-Polar was released.  Connect is an album that takes all types of Sick Puppies sound and combines it all into one as there are elements of Welcome To the Real World, Dressed Up As Life and Tri-Polar in one album. You have the hard rock and heavy bass songs such as, Die To Save You, There's No Going Back, Walk Away, Gunfight and The Trick The Devil Did; and you have the ballads, Poison, Where Did The Time Go, Telling Lies, Connect, Run, Healing Now and Under A Very Black Sky. The album has a good flow and isn't overpowering.There is a bit of a different sound though than their previous albums, mixing in the elements of the past and adding some new things.  To me, it sounds like a mix of bands like Skillet, Citizens Way, Evanescence, Lifehouse and others.That doesn't mean it is a bad thing as I enjoy the new album and think it is quite good overall.  Some may complain that is overproduced and that well may be true as compared to their other albums but as bands find their way into the mainstream and gain popularity, this always seems to happen.I as a fan am not disappointed and think this release makes me even more of a fan as this album has a well-rounded sound with good songs, good lyrics and good overall music.  Giving Emma a more prominent role in the vocals has made a good band even better."
A2HK0E5K7RW3BQ,B00D3ZJB1S,5.0,"Same deluxe version packaged with one more excellent bonus track \"Naivete In Black\"! Bought this 13 instead of the standard deluxe release! A definite Black Sabbath 13 upgrade! Sabbath legacy fans, go find and get it ASAP!"
A332W1GRILS1QR,B00D3ZJBLS,5.0,Holy cow is she funny!  She's very funny and irreverent (if I'm using that correctly ;-).  You never know what's coming next and it's going to be funny.

A2WSUPXL63TID6,B00D3ZJBZE,4.0,"Too me, Jennifer Holliday is a vocalist who can bring chills to your spine.  Years ago,she covered Van Mccoy's &#34;Giving Up&#34; and it was so emotional. This collection hasa lot of great moments. I like that she found a way to show different shades to hervoice to re-interpret these classics. My favorites are &#34;Love Me By Name&#34;, &#34;Love WantsTo Dance&#34; and &#34;Nobody Does It Better.&#34;"
A212C9LINYTCK9,B00D3ZJF2S,4.0,If you are looking for a gospel cd that has it all.. this is the perfect cd for you - You have the &#34;get up and praise Jesus&#34; songs - You have the &#34;jesus is rocking me slow&#34; songs - I have been listening to this cd every day...
A2RZY68AP11NOS,B00D3ZJF2S,5.0,"This is THE BEST Tye Tribbett CD yet! This blessing is now my ULTIMATE FAVORITE album of all the favorite albums of various artist that I have in my collection! If you don't have this CD yet, please go and get it! You will not regret it!"
A38H8TX713D4RW,B00D3ZJF2S,5.0,There is nothing trite about Tye Tribbett's gospel messages.  Tye brings an energy and passion to his soulful music that can only be attributed to a deep love for Jesus Christ.  Incredible.  And I don't EVER purchase gospel albums.
A1KLZA0GF7H9CV,B00D3ZJFBO,5.0,"I waited weeks to get this one because I really wanted &#34;Chaos is a Ladder&#34;, but fell in love with &#34;A Lannister Always Pays His Debts,&#34; &#34;Kingslayer,&#34; and &#34;Mhysa.&#34; I was surprised by &#34;For The Realm&#34; - it's a soft acoustic guitar (?) tune that's lighter than this soundtrack's usual darker cellos and whatnot, so I quite like it. Probably my favorite season's soundtrack so far!"
A1YC6LCZFEZF1A,B00D3ZJG8G,5.0,"He had never heard of Keiko Matsui, but she is now on his favorites list.  I gave a gift that will last happily."
A26WUEKYKQA361,B00D3ZJG8G,5.0,"Love the CD. Bought is it as a Christmas present for my husband. Once he played it I stole it! Very soothing and original, as is all of Ms. K's music. Keep rocking!!!!"
A2K1TSFOL8L40X,B00D3ZJG8G,5.0,"Very good, smooth easy listening Jazz. One the first jazz artist to be trained by the Yamaha Music Academy and she learned her craft well."
A1LFRJ3CSQFCI6,B00D3ZJG8G,4.0,"My heart is torn with this album KEIKO is supperb as expected but the mastering quality is a let down,also so many wasted top musicians and producers.Lets face it this album could have been a masterpiece if someone took it seriously.The production quality is low buget the over use of drum bass the poor mixing and mastering...its very frustratiing to listen to good music gone bad....for me its about sound quality and production so its a good cd but not up to my standards so 4 stars still a good buy."
A1OLUFOJ6XJYC3,B00D3ZJG8G,5.0,"Even though this album is not the usual Keiko, It is still at the top in her music. Believe me it will get it share of ride time in my player while I am driving to and fro."
ASJPUDKJKO0RG,B00D3ZJG8G,4.0,"I love Keiko Matsui.  She is an extraordinary pianist.  This wasn't my favorite CD by her, but I would definitely recommend it especially if you love the piano."
A3VVIMX2OVW7JT,B00D3ZJG8G,5.0,She absolutely loves Keiko Matsui. She says it allows her to become invisible at work once the ear buds are in.
A2EI61B34OKF52,B00D3ZJGTU,5.0,This band and album are both freakin amazing. Seriously buy this album!!!! There new unclean vocalist sounds amazing and fits well with the band. I look forward to their next album!
A1DHO28IKRHYKA,B00D3ZJH3K,5.0,Great album . Never heard of this band . Just found out about them while browsing other albums / soundclips here on AmazonMP3 . This is an excellent album . Hook filled melodic hardrock / aor !  If you like this genre ..Buy this ! .... Also buy albums I suggest from these bands : ROYAL HUNT -- MAGNITUDE 9 -- SILENT FORCE
A20X9H03PZP4AT,B00D3ZJHC6,3.0,This cd is just OK.  Nothing stands out here---nothing like their first 4 albums.. Missing the original singer so badly.  Forgettable after 2 or 3 times listening to it.  Need more upbeat songs and rocking guitar.
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00D4AA73I,5.0,"I love this CD! Not only are the women beautiful, but so are their voices. From beginning to end you are enchanted with the magnificent sounds of the riveting music these girls have produced."
A92F571Y9MTW6,B00D4AA73I,5.0,"Several months after the release of their 2003 album \"Home\", the country group the Dixie Chicks were mired in controversy. Lead singer Natalie Maines made comments about then-president George W. Bush, which turned the group from media darlings to public enemy number one in a nanosecond. Protests and blackballing ensued, but that didn't stop the trio. In 2006, they released the Grammy award winning, Rick Rubin produced \"Taking The Long Way\". After a few years of silence sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire wanted to record a new album- the only problem was Natalie wasn't ready to go back into the studio. Instead of waiting on her, the sisters continued on as a duo and named themselves the Court Yard Hounds. They released their self titled debut in 2010, which was produced by Jim Scott (best known for producing Robert Randolph & The Family Band's \"Unclasssified\"). While their debut was critically acclaimed, they didn't stop there.In 2013, they released their sophomore album \"Amelita\". They teamed up again with Scott as producer- only this time around their music is gear3d more toward folk music. On the opening track \"Sunshine\", they sing of a person who has a difficult personality. The song was co-written by Massachusetts singer Jonatha Brooke- former member of the short-lived duo The Story. The title track \"Amelita\" shows them extending a helping hand to a woman whose heart and spirit is broken. Songwriter/producer Greg Kurstin helps out on the song about finding happiness \"The World Smiles\", while they sing of being realistic on \"Aimless Upward\". They take an optimistic approach to a new relationship on the ballad \"A Guy Like You\", and celebrate having a good time on \"Rock All Night\". On the melancholy ballad \"Divided\", they try to fix a marriage that's slowly headed towards the end. On \"Gets You Down\", they address a man who's afraid to fall in love. The Court Yard Hounds' \"Amelita\" is a great sophomore album from the duo. Though they may have tried to appeal to a wider audience on their debut, they are more at home with taking an artistic stance."
A2OHW7D1MUKY0J,B00D4AA73I,5.0,"This album is truly, just perfection! It feels a lot like the 'Home' album by the Dixie Chicks which is my favorite DC album; except 'Amelita' is brighter. Of course we're missing Natalie's strong vocals in the Court Yard Hounds, but Emily & Martie hold their own with their strong musicianship & great compositions. Their voices are good, with Emily's being the stronger of the two, but Martie's voice is so lovely (as heard in 'Guy like you' & 'Gets you Down'). There's a really sweet, nostalgic vibe to the album; it sounds like quality, vintage country music, yet fresh. It feels like such high quality, especially compared to the country/pop crap spewed all over the radio.Again, even though there's no Natalie, it still feels like the Dixie Chicks in their finest form.'Sunshine', while faster in pace, has the same spirit of 'Wide Open Spaces' and along with 'Amelita' both songs feel like some of the very best singles of The Dixie Chicks like 'Ready to Run', 'Long Time Gone' & 'The Long Way Around'.'The World Smiles' is one of the most beautifully uplifting songs I've ever heard. If a song could glow, this one would. Aside from the inspiring lyrics, the song just sounds great; the way the guitars slide about 3/4 the way through the song are so joyous and give it that pure country feel. I'd compare it to 'More Love' & 'I Hope''Aimless Upward' is comparable to 'The World Smiles' in it's  beauty, but this one is softer and more tranquil- along the lines of 'Landslide' and 'Cowboy Take Me Away''Guy Like You' is so cool and chill the way it chugs along; fun to sing along to and cool hearing Martie sing lead. Comparable to 'Never Say Die' & 'Baby Hold On''Rock All Night' is really good. A great party song that could be played along with 'If I fall you're going down with Me', 'Sin Wagon', 'Some days You gotta dance' & 'Let er rip''Phoebe' stands out as the most anthem-like song on the album and a personal favorite. It's by far the most fun song on the album. Like 'Goodbye Earl', 'Hole in my Head' & 'Lubbock or Leave it''Divided' is full of yearning and somehow feels like 'Travelin' Soldier', 'Loving Arms', 'Bitter End' & 'Silent House''Gets You Down' is soft and lovely, like 'Lullaby', 'Godspeed' & 'Let Him Fly''Watch Your Step' is the most edgy and sexy of all the songs. It has a really cool groove, like 'There's Your Trouble', 'I Like It' & 'Truth No. 2'& Finally 'The Road You Take' is an appropriately grand closer, along the lines of 'Heartbreak Town' & 'Top of the World'All in all, I can't say enough good things about this album. I'm legitimately so happy it exists because it's such a gem."
A25VIJ228PQZA,B00D4ABSZ4,2.0,"I personally don't hear any &#34;Standout&#34;, tracks in this album.  Andrew Belle's debut was one of my favorite, think we have the sophomore curse happening. Holding out that the third album will blow his career up ; to the level he deserves."

A1KLIE6N3X38PC,B00D4ABYA8,5.0,I knew that after making aan album like dopium his next one would be more in the same fresh new direction. I was right. He seems to be more engerized and full of his old wu tang spirit. he isn't a gza or method man hes golden arms a slow and stready courgous rhymer check this if you need your next wu fix
A2RNV0BWW4VG83,B00D4ABYA8,5.0,"The beats on the album are realy good. \"Heads Up\" with GZA and \"Mt. Everest\" with Inspectah Deck and Elzhi are two of the strongest tracks of the album. U-God's flow and mic presence are the best they have been in years."
A12W8NRSYR593I,B00D4D90D8,5.0,"If you liked \"To Lose My Life\" or \"Ritual\" the other LP's White Lies did.....you will love \"Big TV\" as they have not deviated from their genuine gazer-esque, sub pop, or what I call #mindpharma style music as it so relaxing and easy to enjoy immediately. Unlike other bands...say Cavo, Pop Evil, Godsmack, I need to be in a mood for those.....#mindpharma style music just sucks you right in and if you go with the flow...you'll be relaxed in no time. If it is a really, really bad day....then try some David Lanz and a full glass of your favorite wine (if you are over the legal drinking age!) or a big glass of your favorite lager. Enjoy!

A31OPSNAXK3UA7,B00D605EZW,5.0,Y&T; has been one of my favorite bands since 80's!I even have their earlier 70's albums. This is agood place to start with some of their best albums!Dave Meinketti is one of the greatest guitarist andvocalist of all time! the songwriter is always greatand one of those bands that should've been bigger.Black Tiger is a monster album every hard rock fanshould have in the collection but really all theiralbums should be in your collection! if your a real rocker!
ACRX7PE6S65ZM,B00D6CZ1C6,3.0,"I bought the album because of the lead song which is so catchy, fun and sexy.  I find the rest of the album not as good musically and way too explicit sexually for my taste."
A1OKWI3JUDFX6S,B00D6CZ1C6,3.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE THE NEW SONG BLURRED LINES and there are a couple more songs I like on the cd but if I had a choice I would just buy those few songs but I love Robin Thicke but this one was just ok
A3V0DWFLHV9D1D,B00D6CZ1C6,4.0,Since Robin hit the scene he has not slowed down he has something to say and says it well OK a little heavy on the language but you were for warned another platinum to go Keep it up
A1PWV12BKHFYKK,B00D6CZ1C6,5.0,I have all of Robin Thicke's albums and this is one of the best collabrations.He is surely getting better with time.
A2YYQQEMIKF103,B00D6CZ1C6,1.0,One good song on a CD.  Robin has a great talent.  I hated to see it wasted on a sorry CD.
A826ZVZ577P50,B00D6CZ1C6,3.0,"Haven't given this album a decent shake, but the titled song has been my summer jam and expect the rest of the album to follow the same vein and previous albums and be 70% decent."
A3PP26BA94F0WS,B00D6CZ1C6,2.0,"Blurred Lines and Give It 2 U, are the only two songs I've listened to more than once. I also have Now 48, with Blurred Lines, but, I appreciate the unedited explicit version much better, so, just to have that, it's worth buying Robin's cd."
A1WFJ04YJEJVA7,B00D6CZ1C6,1.0,"It is easy to say that Robin Thicke's soulful and romantic manner has disappeared gradually after the popular hit \"Blurred Lines\" hit the radios and became a viral success on YouTube. It can be mostly proved by the fact that this album is not his best at all, it is disappointing, uncomfortable, poorly created, rushed and sexually driven in contrast to his last albums. Instead of focusing more on touchy romantic subjects as usual, which is mostly his thing, he focuses more on being sexually aggressive. Songs like Blurred Lines, Take It Easy on Me, Give it 2 U and Feel Good pushes it too far. While on the other hand, songs like For the Rest of My Life, Top of the World and Good Life take a calmer and better route to his usual style.Most of the songs sound completely rushed, quick and most definitely mainstream. It is basically an album that lacks meaning, not even the collaborations from Pharrell, T.I. and Kendrick Lamar can help this album be as interesting. In sum, if you prefer listening to an album packed with 8 out of 11 mainstream-like songs about sex, Robin Thicke flaunting his humongous penis, \"giving it to me\", taking it easy and going stupid for people, I suggest you buy. If not, go out and buy Justin Timberlake's 20/20 Experience, an album Robin Thicke could have topped. This album will be completely a forgettable one that lacks a lot of catchy songs with the exception of Blurred Lines."
A280KHZO2L7GKA,B00D6CZ1C6,3.0,"Overall, it is a solid album but if you buy it based on Blurred Lines alone, you will be sadly dissappointed.  So why did I give it 4 stars anyway.  Simple.  If you judge the songs individually and NOT based on expectations from Blurred Lines, it is actually good.  If anything, Blurred Lines sticks out like a sore thumb...it just isn't cohesive to the rest of the album. Also, some of the tracks are a bit too vulgar (Give It 2 U) when it need not be. That's why I dinged the album down to 3 stars."
A2VKTAMS2WCTQJ,B00D6DVRX2,5.0,"Sting and I are from the same part of England, the one-time bustling ship building area of the Northeast where we have our own language and culture rooted in the shipyards and the seafaring vessels built there. The closure of the yards during the Thatcher rule of terror was devastating to the area, coinciding with the shutting down of the coal mining industry s well.  Sting has created a monument of exceptional beauty to the area in this finely written and well recorded collection of songs.  It has an intimate collection to his earlier CD, 'Soul Cages'."
A3BCV98F6W4LAF,B00D6DVRX2,4.0,"I've been a fan of Sting's work ever since The Dream of the Blue Turtles came out back in the 80's.  I was a Police fan before that, but I quickly recognized that this was a newer, different Sting, who was capable of reinventing himself.  This appears to be the case once again with this new album.  I bought this one after reading many reviews, mainly because of the links back to The Soul Cages (an album that I absolutely adore, especially after seeing him live while touring for that album), fully expecting that I might not like this new Sting anyway.And at first, I didn't like it, really.  Played it through a couple of times and thought, \"Oh, well, that's $8 bucks down the drain.\"  But there were a couple of songs that drew me in (Language of Birds and the Ballad of the Great Eastern, I believe, there are those Soul Cages links again), and I decided to give it one more listen.  And another.  And another.  And I have to say, it's growing on me. Even the Sea-Chanty type songs (Dead Man's Boots for one) have an underlying message and story that I find intriguing.Yes, the Geordie accent is a little odd, but he does a pretty good job of it (as far as I can tell; admittedly I've never been to Newcastle, so I don't know what the real thing sounds like) and it does sort of fit in with the theme of the songs, so after a few listens you sort of expect it and it doesn't seem so foreign.Those of you who are strictly fans of the earlier Sting will most likely not find much on this album to enjoy.  Those of you who loved The Soul Cages, especially the references to the sea, shipbuilding and cages, and enjoy a song as much for its story as its melody, should give this a go.  I'm glad I picked it up and am happy to see new music from Sting after all these years."
A6IJYDBNKVNN9,B00D6DVRX2,5.0,"Sting is one of the most creative, and innovative  artists around today. Never content to rest on his considerable laurels he continues to explore and expand.In recent years he has explored music of the Middle  Ages and collaborated with a symphony orchestra. With The Last Ship tells a musical story of the city in which he was raised and how it's shipbuilding industry disappeared and how that affected the lives of the people who lived there at the time. It's an homage to his father and that generation. The songs are engaging and the music is definitely up to his high standard. I'm looking forward to when he takes this project on the road it really will come to life on stage!"
A1PL470Q9XEBXZ,B00D6I7EMU,5.0,"Love soundtracks to movies/tv shows. You don't hear this style of music a lot, it works. Lost count of all my soundtracks, I have lots of movies. If the soundtracks is very good, it's mine."
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00D6NKMUQ,5.0,"I absolutely love this CD and Chris Young. I mostly buy country music by female musicians, but Chris Young put out a product that was hard to pass up. Buy this and you won't regret it."
A3HW7JU11T5ZQW,B00D6NKMUQ,2.0,I love chris youngs voice!!!!!! I just don't know why he's going a little off the beaten path. I will still enjoy him in concert with paisley and bradbery.  Chris bring back 100 percent the old country. Wont buy this cd but did buy some invidual songs.
A22FRLKZ3KYRLT,B00D6QU6RW,4.0,"Their sound on this album is a lot like The Script and OneRepublic. I enjoyed this one from start to finish, but I miss the original BSB vibe from the 90's. Long live ol' school!"
A21HF7PKHVJWOP,B00D6QU6RW,2.0,I am very disappointed. I did not hear that usual Backstreet themed style anywhere in this CD. I'm still a fan nevertheless.
A1TX3VNWII1TOJ,B00D6QUMWG,5.0,"Reading the glowing reviews for this disc had me wonder if there's just a bit too much hype.  After all, we live in an era when record companies issue less and less complete opera recordings (and when they do - they're not really done in the studio, but in concert settings, which is a lot cheaper) and this leaves the opera fans in perpetual state of hunger.  We're purchasing more and more remastered recordings even if we already have them in earlier remaster forms or LPs.  So I was just wondering if we would swallow pretty much anything these days.  (I mean, some of us are purchasing Bocelli's CDs, no?).  Well, I was wrong to think that.  There's nothing hyped about Anna Netrebko, all the praise heaped on her is completely deserved.  What a voice!  And what a smart choice of programm&eacute; for this disc, too, as it showcases different sides of Netrebko's talent.  Several times it demanded both high and low extreme of the voice and she delivered with such apparent ease, it's quite stunning.The voice itself has definitely matured since the days Netrebko sang Natasha Rostova and Juliette.  But, like good wine, it became smoother and richer, not looser and shrill like many voices unfortunately become.  The lower and middle registers expanded even further, while the top notes are still there, just more refined and focused than before. Most notably, Netrebko's enunciation, which sometimes suffered before, even in her native Russian repertoire, is now on par with the rest of her vocal assets.  She has really become the leading dramatic (should I say \"spinto\"?) soprano of today.The recital starts out with a bang - the high-strung and grueling role of Lady Macbeth.  Previously (with the exception of Callas) this role brought to mind mezzos like Cossotto or Verrett.  But due to her strong lower registers Netrebko easily copes with the role's tough demands, and her Mad Scene is actually far more effective because of that change from strong & defiant to wounded and ethereal that she's able to demonstrate.  This is followed by a beautiful scene from Giovanna D'Arco, a rather neglected early-Verdi work that's brimming with great tunes.  Here Netrebko masterfully lightens her voice and makes it \"float\" ravishingly beautifully. Two arias from \"I Vespri Siciliani\" (another neglected work, this time from Verdi's mid-period) follow, the second \"Merche, dilette amiche\" is more familiar to the casual listeners and sometimes referred to as \"Bolero\".  It has some fioritura (or is it coloratura) demands, and here again Netrebko bests her former self - it's very clear and effortless.  Elizabetta Valois's great aria \"Tu che le vanita\" is full of sorrow, as she bids farewell to her youth and hopes, and Netrebko's voice is achingly beautiful and plangent here.Switch gears once again, and meet her Leonora, one of the most beloved heroines in opera.  All her Act IV arias along with the famed \"Miserere\" (with Rolando Villazon, who, just like I described hereVillazon Verdisings an imperfect first verse and a perfect 2nd one) are here, making me pine for a complete recording (maybe with Kaufmann and Hvorostovsky?).  What a splendid Leonora she is - noble and powerful, yet very vulnerable.  I listened to this CD several times and it's unlikely to leave my weekly rotation for quite some time. Don't miss and do yourself a huge favor by ignoring the nay-sayers."
AKUY1DNKBM0IU,B00D6QUMWG,4.0,"I love Anna Netrebko!  I think she is the real deal in being a great singer who can act.  I liked, but did not love this Verdi album.  She got through Macbeth and Ernani OK, hit her stride with Don Carlo and fiished well with Trovatore.  When I hear Macbeth, it is hard to get Callas out of my head and the same with Ernani and Sills or Don Carlo and Trovatore with Caballe. Nevertheless, Netrebko does well and her success with Verdi in the opera house is a good sign that she is well on her way in becoming a good maybe even a great Verdian soprano."
A2AIMXT9PLAM12,B00D6UV0V4,5.0,"Decca made a famous Verdi Requiem under Solti that was a sonic blockbuster, and now they have released a new one that also breaks the sound barrier. It is rackety and thunderous, and although Barenboim makes some effort to evoke religious reverence - Solti threw that out the window - every great climax tries for a knockout punch. As a demonstration of what digital sound can do, ranging from the bass's whispered \"Mors stupebit\" to the cataclysm of the Dies Irae, I can't imagine anything with more impact.The bane of large-scale choral works, when transferred to disk, is the muffled sound of the chorus, whose words are generally unintelligible. So it's startling to hear how perfectly the La Scala chorus has been recorded here. When the orchestra is playing softly, as in the very opening, you can hear the choristers breathing; they are captured in a natural ambience, and the real beauty of heartfelt Italian singing comes through. Karajan's multiple recordings of the Requiem used the Vienna Singverein, and Giulini's classic EMI account features the Philharmonia Chorus as trained by the great Wilhelm Pitz - wonderful ensembles but not as emotional and dramatic as the singing here - this is Italian music, after all. (Elsewhere the engineers let us down by miking the soloists so closely that each one blares into our ears, giving the impression, not of a blended quartet but of four opera singers fighting for the limelight. This effect is worse in the Kyrie and improves, thankfully, when there is softer singing.)The old saw that the Requiem was Verdi's greatest opera reminds us that the ideal solo quartet should be the same as for Aida. The Reiner recording from Vienna, also on Decca, comes close to the ideal thanks to the presence of Leontyne Price, one of the greatest Aidas, and the unsurpassable tenor Jussi Bjorling, even though he was caught late in his career. But perhaps the unsurpassable has been surpassed in the Ingemisco of Jonas Kaufmann, who sings like a true Radames but with nuanced feeling and inflection - not a single note is bawled.  The other singers hover around the same high standard. Pape uses his magnificent voice impressively, even if he never sounds Italianate. Garanca is also lovely vocally, but the words seem to mean little to her; it's as if she learned her part syllabically.Barenboim's first Verdi Requiem from Chicago continues to hold up well - it's in the running for the best modern recording before this one arrived. Marshalling large forces is one of his strengths as a conductor (his Missa Solemnis from Chicago is also excellent). Here he employs a little extra rubato and holds back the tempo in some slow passages, but he doesn't cross the line into milking the score. Since a listener's attention will be so focused on the singing, it doesn't matter that the La Scala orchestra isn't a serious rival in this work to the Vienna and Berlin Phil., the Philharmonia, or the Chicago Symphony. There's some excitable playing in keeping with the choral singing, and that's enjoyable. The brass aren't disciplined or refined, but who can complain when they blast away with such enthusiasm?The soprano steps forward in the Libera Me, which has been a showcase for divas fully equal to anything in Verdi's operas.  We seem to be at the end of the great Italian tradition (Muti's recent account from Chicago featured a distinctly stressed Barbara Frittoli, although she was nearly perfect in her prime).  Leading German soprano Anja Harteros, who happens to be Kaufmann's favorite opera partner, made a fine showing in a previous Italian-based Requiem from Rome under Pappano in 2009 (EMI). Now the voice has grown in strength and security. She even sounds credibly Verdian, no surprise since Harteros successfully sings the lead in Trovatore and Don Carlo. Is she Scotto, Price, or Caniglia? No, so don't expect the all-out pathos and tenderness of yesteryear. Harteros delivers no heartbreaking moments, but I can't think of anyone on the scene who is better in this part.In all, here's a Verdi Requiem that skims the cream of the crop, an account to rival and surpass any from the past three decades.  Only the great ones stand above it."
AFPD8B050ILB4,B00D6ZCVRQ,3.0,"This is a nice little nugget but it shows Billy is a better vocalist than Marilyn and unfortunately the songs at some point or another sung by Diana Ross are nowhere near as good has hers. Why does Billy and Marilyn's version of \"I Thought It Took a Little Time\" feature the exact beginning of \"You Are Everything\"? Has anyone ever through the years caught on to this? Plus the remake of \"Stay With Me\" is nowhere near as soulful as Miss Ross'even though it was recorded around the same time as Miss Ross' but does prove Billy is better than Marilyn. Just listen to Diana's take on it from her \"To Love Again\". They  recorded \"I Thought It Took A Little Time\"(Pamela Sawyer) for this set 2 years after it was a Top 50 hit for Diana Ross and a Top 5 AC hit for her as well and they could not make their version even better? So many people have recorded \"I Thought It Took a Little Time\". So many - Gloria Estefan, Miss Ross, McCoo and Billy Davis. It would be interesting to hear what others feel is the best version."

Now, on to the album. This is an eclectic mixture of soul and R&B; that just meshes so well and works. This is an album that has great writing, production, and lyrical content that deserves accolades and Grammy nods. I do not give out five star reviews regularly, but this one definitely fits the bill in my humble opinion.Favorite tracks (all are great, but these are the standouts to me):Her Favorite SongReach Out RichardRobot LoveCorsican Ros&eacute;CrimeAllie JonesWhere Does This Door GoI basically wrote down half the tracks on this album, but it is worth it to get the deluxe edition if you can."
A1HS29ROT18AW8,B00D7DTRWY,5.0,This cd blew me away totally. I would recommend this cd to anyone.
A1EO5YR1238VL3,B00D7DTRWY,3.0,"The songs where Zakk departs from the BLS formula - and it's very much a formula now - tap his more melodic side.  The star attractions here:  Empty Promises, Scars, Angel of Mercy and Shades of Gray are all refreshing heartfelt tracks.  I don't think it's any accident that these tracks stand out because they require a little more effort from Mr. Wylde who can surely write 5 metal tunes in that many hours of the quality often found here.Compounding the problem are several production issues that have diminished the quality of the last handful of BLS releases.  Every metal track on this recording sounds like it was recorded with the same guitars, the same everything.  It's like they just set up the band and plowed through the recording process.  It's kind of funny that Zakk makes references to Dali adding different colors as pieces develop (see editorial review), because that's the last thing that happened on many of these tunes.Zakk has also fallen into the trap of playing too fast on many of the songs and falling back on many of - what are it this point - are cliches of his own style.  You could toss many of the solos up into the air on this record and they would fall into place on any of the tunes.  They sound like the same riffs reshuffled into different orders.  A furious run past the twelfth fret followed by a long bent note accented with wah wah is heard waaaay too often.  Of course, there are always jarring moments of creativity like the solo in Heart of Darkness which sounds like an elephant took over the lead halfway through - very inspired and jaw dropping!Another thing Zakk should break himself of is singing his own harmonies, which are always exactly the same.  He's very fond of the Alice In Chains harmony style, and it makes repeated visits on these tunes.  But the problem is the harmony vocal is Zakk straining above his range and it just drills into your ear after a while, and many tunes sound more similar than they actually are as a consequence.This isn't a bad record by any means, it's just that it could be so much better with some input from a real producer.  Zakk has been at the wheel for a long time now, and I think he tends to get into a &#34;time to make the donuts&#34; frame of mind which holds his records back from reaching that next level."

A2AIMXT9PLAM12,B00D7OXZTY,5.0,"Since his triumphant sweep at the 2005 International Chopin Competition, where he won all five gold medals, Rafal Blechacz, now 28, has moved in opposite directions, becoming a musical hero in his native Poland but pursuing advanced academic studies too and giving relatively few international concerts. His debut album on DG of the Chopin Preludes gave indication of a superb talent, but the follow-ups have been rather low-key or specialized, as in his recital of piano music by Szymanowski. Now he returns to mainstream appeal with a disc of Polonaises.These works weren't meant to be performed together, and even though the \"Military\" and \"Heroic\" Polonaises are world famous, putting together an entire recital devoted to this one musical form is tricky. Pollini wasn't at his best when he tried, and unless you favor Rubinstein's rather refined approach to these extroverted pieces, there aren't any exemplary sets in modern sound that I can think of (I haven't heard Garrick Ohlsson's selection, however). So if successful, Blechacz's new set, which selects, as almost everyone does, Polonaises 1-7 (out of a total of 23 written in all phases of Chopin's career, back to age 7) would be a marked addition to the catalogue.Happily, this is a great recital, encompassing the two most popular Polonaises and one of the most artistically challenging, the Polonaise-Fantasie Op. 61.  On a fine instrument that is very well recorded, Blechacz has everything one would want - brilliant technique, panache, musicality, and a feeling for the peculiar inner rhythms that link the Polonaise to the Mazurka as the two most \"Polish\" of Chopin's output. Horowitz and Cziffra may be more electrifying - each was a unique showman - which takes nothing away from Blechacz's mastery. As much as I admired his Preludes, this album is better, with every mark of the mature interpreter and no trace of the over-trained competition contestant.I had heard knowledgeable grumblings that the pianist was consistently too loud on his recent U.S. tour, and at least once here, in the Polonaise no. 4 in C minor, I felt that Blechacz was too forceful and emphatic. Others might hear the same in the repeated \"drum\" chords in the \"Heroic\" Polonaise or the opening of the Polonaise-Fantasie. There's also a tendency to lean into the line a bit impatiently. Of course, with volume controls the issue of playing too loud is fairly moot. I hear no vulgar banging, always a temptation in the two famous Polonaises. Blechacz encompasses the thrilling F sharp minor Polonaise (no. 5) in one confident sweep. I can't imagine any rival doing better at conveying Chopin's heroic intent without resorting to Lisztian rhetoric. Although the Polonaise is a dance, these are often nationalistic demonstrations of patriotism, and keeping rhetoric out is an achievement in itself.In the end, such a long stretch of musical chest-thumping tends to be exhausting, and pianists are probably wise to program no more than two or three Polonaises at a time. Blechacz gives no quarter in his headlong enthusiasm to make these pieces thrilling, and the fact that he can is recommendation enough. For me, excess of charisma can hardly be considered a fault."

A1LH63LHZD4H1A,B00D8HNQZI,1.0,"OK, so I will admit, I bought this album on a whim.  I was a fan of NIN way back in the day.  The last album of theirs that I purchased was Downward Spiral.  Actually, I lied.  That was a gift from my cousin Scott.  But I loved that album.  Pretty Hate Machine was awesome.  Broken was great.  This album?  Not so much.  What happened to the angry thrashing guitars?  What happened to Trent's voice? What the heck is this garbage?  It sounds like he took out his laptop, pushed a bunch of random buttons and said &#34;Hey, this sounds kind of like that modem noise crap that Skrillex guy puts out that the kids like so much.  I can make money from this!&#34;  Maybe it's because I'm in my thirties that I don't get this.  Heck, I bought it on LP to add to my collection where as most people that this is targeted toward will probably just illegally download it from some website hosted in a third world country.

I listened to about the first minute of each song before clicking the skip button, praying that I hadn't just wasted almost $30 on this mess (I downloaded the accompanying CD to my computer and listened to it that way... haven't put it on the turntable yet).  Not one redeeming song.  There is a song called &#34;Disappointed&#34; which pretty much sums up the entire experience.  I may have to just hurt myself to see if I still feel. (See how I did that?  That's a lyric from... no, that's not a Johnny Cash song.  Yes, Trent Reznor wrote that... No, Johnny Cash didn't write that and NIN didn't cover... you know what, forget it.  Shut up and go listen to Skrillex on your Beats by Dre.)"
A1RJU2FLXZ4OTA,B00D8HNQZI,4.0,"Trent is doing more great music, is not like all classic Downward Spiral or With Teeth but is a good album, it has some great songs and others that sound just like previous works like Goths or HTDA, and that' not bad is just that is not the characteristic NIN's sound. In general I think is a good album."
A2NB25Z28CEWTI,B00D8HNQZI,5.0,"I like the new Nine Inch Nails album. It's different, controversial among NIN fans, with some jarring surprises, but I think it's his best since The Fragile.To some Hesitation Marks sounds like a follow up to Pretty Hate Machine. Actually it sounds like Pretty Hate Machine is a darker angrier follow up to this.I'm a long time NIN fan. They were my favorite band when I was 14 in high school until I really dived into Tool. This new album isn't on the same level as iconic classics like Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral, or The Fragile, but it's pretty good, and A LOT better than With Teeth or Survivalism or The Slip. So I'm glad to see that Trent has regained his footing here. I don't mind that Hesitation Marks is different, because it's creative cool music.There was a progression arc of getting angrier and darker after Pretty Hate Machine, and it feels like the ethos of this new album actually fits right into that arc, but placed BEFORE Pretty Hate Machine. Which is kind of cool actually, because I was a bit disappointed since With Teeth, and even though Hesitation Marks is so different in some ways, it also feels to me like the Nine Inch Nails I love is back!There are a couple low points (Everything and All Time Low). Satellite sounds like it's a song by Apparat on hisWallsalbum, but that's a good thing, Apparat is amazing. I really love Copy of A and In Two.Trent Reznor is pushing 50 and he still pushed himself to come up with something fresh and clever. Respect."
A35B1IURYB9EVM,B00D8HNQZI,5.0,Trent Reznor puts a nice mix together of what fans have come to expect. The album is a great listen from top to bottom!
A1L37A25H9YOEE,B00D8HNQZI,3.0,"I really don't understand what everyone is talking about. This album is not \"different\" or an \"evolution\" of Reznor's sound. If anything, it sounds derivative. I have never been bored by a NIN album until now. What's worse is that I realized the few shining moments of this album only stand out because they almost directly mimic better songs from his better albums. How many times can Trent write about things slipping away, things being put inside him, things he tells himself, etc. By now, we already know that he wishes he could stop himself, but nothing can stop him now. I just wish he'd stop writing such generic lyrics. I don't like being able to predict what words will rhyme in these songs.With the exception of \"Everything,\" I could take any song from this album, stick it on a b-side to With Teeth or The Slip, and be done with it. That's the only song that gives us a hint of something new: a bombastic power-pop anthem that's hopeful and sonically aggressive at once. Sadly, the excitement ends there. Had Reznor taken a bold new direction with this album, I would have supported it, even if it was a drastic departure from his past. The problem is that Hesitation Marks is too aware of its past. It's like how your mom is always self-deprecating about her age and you wish she'd just let it go and be happy with herself.Hesitation Marks is not too poppy. It's not a \"new direction\" I can't accept. It's just boring."
A1FBATXBDIYQBT,B00D93NFMU,5.0,"Basically what I just said. The sound quality has a lot of proximity with the listener, it's very immersive - not a speck of noise besides the music. The pacing Gergiev has is even better than his already genius Parsifal. But the singers add a whole dimension to Das Rheingold, it's as expressive as story-telling. Many vocal effects, and the orchestral playing is beyond gorgeous - comparable in terms of delicacy to Solti's mighty recording with the Wiener. I actually find Gergiev better, because of the audio quality, but also because the intonation is PERFECT - the horn-chorale in the prelude is flawless. Get this recording now. I cannot rate this recording high enough"
AVYHWCIW5LNAX,B00D9FTNFQ,4.0,"The Scottish pop-rock band Travis is back in 2013 with a CD release titled 'Where You Stand' (11 tracks). The CD has a good mixture of alternative/indie rock sound as in the tracks \"Moving\", \"Reminder\", \"Where You Stand\" (title track), \"Warning Sign\" & \"Another Guy\"; classic rock sound in the track \"On My Wall\" and pop/rock sound in the tracks \"Mother\", \"A Different Room\" (wonderful track with a great melody and harmonies), \"New Shoes\" (very interesting sound effects/instrumentation sound), \"Boxes\" (incredible melody, guitar chords and vocals. This is my pick for the best track from the album) and the closing \"The Big Screen\" (slow-tempo track with great keyboard playing). One can see why this band has inspired other British rock bands including Coldplay and Keane.Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \"Boxes\", \"A Different Room\" and \"Mother\".On overall, the pop-rock outfit Travis has a good album in the CD release 'Were You Stand', a recommended CD listening.Suggested downloads are \"Boxes\", \"A Different Room\" & \"Mother\"."
A3TUFHEE8KSD6R,B00D9FTNFQ,5.0,"Often it takes a second or third listen of an album to get a solid sense of its quality and know whether you're going to listen to it again.  Travis' Where You Stand falls in that rare category of an effort that won me over the first time through.  From the energetic opening \"Mother\" I knew the band was back in grand style.  The title track \"Where You Stand\" moves the other direction with a driving depth and determined maturity.  There's new creative force behind familiar sounds in tracks like \"Warning Sign\" and \"Another Guy.\"  My personal favorite is the penultimate \"Boxes,\" a perfect mix of transcendent sound and lyrical longing. From start to finish this album deserves many listens.  Travis is back and confident."
AYH87FUOPOAQ0,B00D9PUX5A,4.0,"Not as good as Fury of Our Makers Hand or The Last Kind Words. However, after Beast and Pray For Villains it's good to see them trending back towards the old direction of songs that have build and crescendo rather than songs that are intense, but flat."
A1650I94SH53EH,B00D9PUX5A,5.0,"THIS ALBUM MADE ME AN INSTANT FAN!!!!!! WINTER KILLS BY DEVILDRIVER IS INTENSE, BRUTAL, CHAOTIC AND MASTERFULLY CRAFTED......\"PREPARE TO RAGE!\"."
A2IYQHCLPV4C5H,B00D9Q8JIW,4.0,"This CD is a great tribute to a man who made great music. Although his passing leaves a void in the world of smooth jazz, the music he left with us will live on as a testament to his ability as an accomplished musician. If you are not a fan, this CD is a must buy for your collection. He was great as a basketball player in the NBA; he was even greater in the world of music. Wayman Tisdale - you will be missed! To view a documentary detailing the life of Wayman Tisdale, consult NBAtv programming in your local area."
AT5SG6ZYM2ZJM,B00D9Q8JIW,1.0,"The songs on this CD is not his \"Absolute\" greatest hits.  9 out of the 12 songs are from Wayman's last 3 CD's.  I have 7 of Wayman's CD's and the first 4 have much better hits than his last 3 CD's."
A7TZ1KOGA4A01,B00DAPOHU6,5.0,Another great cd from Jack Johnson.  This is much more mellow than I expected but I didn't know what to expect.  Jack is a master at word craft and melody.  Another great cd that will not disappoint.  Great addition to any collection.
ARD0370K9J7LF,B00DAPOHU6,5.0,"Love this album, but then again I don't think Jack's ever put out a bad one! Just writing in to say that I was surprised to get two discs inside the cover, I thought it was a 2-disc set until I discovered they were the same! I will donate the extra disc to the local community radio station."
A2J8CAP9SED53I,B00DAPOHU6,5.0,"If you like Jack, you will love this album. Light and breezy and always content with depth and emotion. Love his voice, love his writing, love his playing. Big Fan!"
A3A1JYOG384DRP,B00DAPOHU6,1.0,Not  worth  a  dime!!!!
AWPTIEL7CNS20,B00DAPOHU6,4.0,This is another good cd from Jack Johnson.  All the songs are well written and I like it more each time I listen to it.
A1OQUM7JUXZ0IP,B00DAPOHWE,5.0,"Though I'm a Mariah fan til the end of time, I was starting to think that maybe it was Mariah's ending time.  Don't get me wrong, I love MOAUP and MC2U, nothing really moved me from either of those CDs.  Except, maybe, for \"Languishing.\"  Now as for this CD.  THIS IS THE CD I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!  I'm listening to \"Camouflage\" as I write this.  My God, if you could feel what I feel when you're listening to this song -- you'd never long for another song.  So extraordinarily beautiful.  It's great to hear DemBabies on \"Supernatural\" and \"Meteorite\" is destined to be a dance floor anthem.  \"Cry\" is perfect -- just perfect.  Finally, I gotta say \"It's A Wrap\" ft Mary J Blige is THE S***!!!  Welcome back Mariah! You've been missed!!!"
A3KL7QYWXUXI2M,B00DAPOHWE,5.0,Pretty solid album
A3VP3WQS32ZDTZ,B00DAPOHWE,5.0,Let me start off by saying I love this album.  But it's only because I've been a Mariah Carey fan since 1995.  Everything about this album is why it's going to be her worst selling of her career.  Me I am Mariah...  NOBODY WANTS THAT...  They want to see the hunger and drive in your eyes just like in 1990.  They want you to stop being DIVA Mariah Carey and be the music talent you use to be.  This is just not what I wanted to see...  and truth is 55k in the first week says you need to go back to the drawing board or just retire with some of honor you once had.  Drop all the crap and go back to making music the right way.
A237UQWA01EGVD,B00DAPOHWE,1.0,"What? A Chanteuse, dull and over done, I am tired of her and her music sounds all the same. There are new and better sounding female singers, you time has come, and gone, I wont buy anymore of your music. your past it. times up."
A1NS9WO1VACAUN,B00DAPOHWE,5.0,"When listening to this gorgeous new album, I cant help but be transported back to a time when Mariah Carey was first starting out and you would hear these powerhouse vocals on the radio or on TV.  She took a break from this style of singing in the last decade chasing after fresher beats and muted vocals which resulted in major success with her song of decade, \"We Belong Together.\"  I am so glad to report that Mariah focuses on showcasing her lyrical prowess and THAT vocal magic on this album. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM.What you get here is a jam packed album of beautiful melodic music from an iconic artist who becomes eligible for the rock n roll hall of fame next year.  What you may not be getting is immediately accessible made for radio tracks, which I am relieved about.  Mariah no longer needs to be recording music for radio to respond to.To describe this album, lets start with her tradition of doing a cover or two on her albums.  My favorite track on the album happens to be one of these covers, the George Michael track \"One More Try.\"  For you 80's fans, if you really want some nostalgia, listen to this one immediately.  Mariah also dips into disco dance sounds for two tracks and she sounds right at home.  One of them, You Don't Know What To Do, could be 2014's summer dance jam and features Wale while Meteorite is a magical disco house jam which rockets her into exciting new territory.The balladry is just near perfection on tracks like Cry. and Camouflage while tracks like Thirsty and Dedicated have super fresh urban beats that could easily find a home on today's radio playlists if given the opportunity.  There really is something for all of her fans on this project all while maintaining a full project experience.Here's my breakdown of the album GEMS:1 One More Try - Stunning emotional balladry makes this all her own.  This could be a giant international hit for her. I hope to see this released as a single.2 Cry. - This haunting, emotive ballad feels like it comes from the \"Butterfly\" era.  Her vocals are at their most powerful and this is going to go down as a major Mariah fan favorite.  This may not be the type of track she should release as a single but this wiill be the \"Petals\" and \"Close My Eyes\" of this album and is truly the perfect album opener.3 Meteorite - Q-tip produces this spacey, disco jam and her voice is just sheer magic on this out of the box dance track.  Send this to the clubs ASAP.4 You Don't Know What To Do - This seems like it is going to be a single based on Mariah performing it live during her album promotion.  With its highly addicting chorus, this could potentially be a big summer dance jam if promoted properly and embraced by radio.5 Camouflage - heartbreaking, emotional and highly dramatic with vocals, piano and some background vocals.  Just beautiful.6 Heavenly - A powerful, uplifting anthem with choir and all and a perfect album closer.7 #Beautiful - This became a top 20 hit on the Hot 100 in the summer of 2013 but it's highly disappointing this track didn't do any better. I firmly believe it is because the featured artist is so prominent on the track.  This should have been a Mariah only track or Mariah mostly track.  Nonetheless, it fits perfectly on the album.The Good Stuff:1 Dedicated - Think 90's Mariah in the vein of \"Always be my baby\" or something from the \"Daydream\" album with minimal guesting from Nas.2 Faded - seems to borrow heavily from her monster hit \"We Belong Together\" in structure but doesn't quite hit the mark for me.  This is the whispery Mariah vocals of the 2000's that ends with a bang.3 Thirsty - bound to be a single. Very addictive beat and chorus.  Think \"Migrate,\" \"Its Like That.\"  This may in fact be one of the only US radio friendly singles on this album.  While I would love to hear any of the tracks on radio, this one seems to have the most potential.4 You're Mine - This is one of the more vocally balanced tracks on the album, where Mariah does her whisper vocals and then also kicks in a little into powerhouse vocals.  This was also released as a single but didn't even crack the top 50 of the hot 100.5 Supernatural - This reminds me of many tracks from the last decade from Mariah.  I wont give this track \"gem\" status because the baby sounds become too distracting as the song progresses.6 Art of Letting Go - Another beautiful ballad that should not have been considered as a single but beautiful as an album closer.The Tracks I can skip (which dont necessarily mean they are bad tracks but just not my cup of tea):1 Make it Look Good - Not a terrible track but Im not a fan of that jazzy sound and she always seems to include one track that sounds like this on every album since Mimi.2 Money - This sounds like a Mariah track from the last three albums and doesn't work for me especially because Fabulos' vocals are just too prominent.  I don't mind a featured artist here and there but Mariah's vocals should always be front and center.The Memoirs tracks:1 Betcha Gon Know - One of my favorites tracks from her last album.  It hasn't been changed at all in terms of beat or arrangement.  This is the version which features R. Kelly on the second verse.  This was released back when Memoirs came out by R Kelly as a male response to Mariah so not sure why it's here.  This is a stunning track in general and I think should have always been a single on her last album so excited that it's getting an opportunity to be re-discovered.2 It's a Wrap - This was one of the weak tracks for me on the last album and doesn't do a thing here either.  I would have replaced one of these Memoirs tracks with her \"target\" bonus track, \"America the Beautiful.\""
A3U3W7URZU9259,B00DAPOHWE,3.0,"I purchased the Deluxe Edition from Target, which included an extra bonus track and BETTER cover art. Mariah's latest CD is pretty good, and IMO, they chose the wrong songs to release as singles. The CD features a wide range of styles and Mariah does sound good vocally. The only track that I gave 5 stars is 'Camouflage', while quite a few others recieved 4 stars, and other tracks recieved 2.5-3 stars. I didn't care for '#Beautiful' (2.5 stars) when it was released last year, and I don't like it now. 'You're Mine (Eternal)' (3 stars) is decent but seems to be missing something. I was REALLY looking forward to hearing Mariah take George Michael's 'One More Try' to another place (like she did successfully with her other remakes on previous albums), but her version fell flat IMO. Tracks that I awarded 4 stars include 'Cry.', 'Faded', 'You Don't Know What to Do', 'Supernatural', 'Make It Look Good', etc. 'Thirsty' (3 stars) is simply WACK and will not be Mariah's 19th #1. As for the bonus tracks, I wasn't blown away and awarded the duets with Mary J. Blige & R.Kelly 3 stars each. 'The Art Of Letting Go' (4 stars) was VERY nice, and 'America The Beautiful' (3.5 stars) features a good interpretation from Mariah. IMO, the Remix Duet of 'Angels Cry' with Ne-Yo would've been a better bonus track than the R.Kelly collaboration. In closing, I enjoy quite a few of the tracks on 'Me. I Am Mariah...The Elusive Chanteuse', which is for all intents & purposes a decent project, but it won't win any new fans for Mariah, and I'm not sure if this CD will reach platinum sales. My rating for the CD is 3.5 stars!"
A3PVGP3C9ILZMB,B00DB2JQ2M,5.0,"Government Mule is amazing.Warren Hayes is an extremely talented and hard working guitarist.They taken their music to new levels.This CD is highly reommended.Thanks,"
AKPGZF0FFHYAM,B00DB2JQ2M,5.0,"Jam packed double album, second side live tracks with guest artists, Dr. John and many other well known guests. Warren Haynes and the rest of the band great value blues album."
A2E5GLJPQAMOBS,B00DBISUN2,4.0,"It seems there are two versions of British duo Goldfrapp: the glammy electro-pop one, and the one that specialize in laid-back, hazy dreaminess. 'Tales of Us' definitely falls into the latter category, with an overall vibe that's reminiscent of the pastoral folk of 2008&#8242;s 'Seventh Tree,' only darker and more dramatic, resulting in a cinematic sound that's both beautiful and sinister-sounding.Opener \"Jo\" provides the general template: languidly strummed acoustic guitars, ethereal background atmospherics, and minimal percussion, with Alison Goldfrapp's sensual vocals acting as a focal point to the moody ambiance. Continuing in this vein is first single \"Annabel\", a gorgeous, deceptively simple song with spare instrumentation and moving lyrics dealing with gender identity. It's a rather emotionally stirring listen, and one of the strongest tracks here.Most of the songs have haunting undercurrents, as heard on \"Drew\" and \"Simone\", both of which feature dreamy, blissful acoustic soundscapes that are underscored with eerie strings and piano. The combination of beauty and freaky on these tracks and others create some conflicting emotions within the listener, where one is never quite sure whether to be scared or just drift away to a relaxed, serene state. \"David Lynch-ian\" is an overused adjective when describing music, but it suits this album perfectly.\"Thea\" is the only song that really busts out of the calm waters, with its slowly thumping electronic dance beat backing layered vocal tracks that intertwine with the synths beautifully. It's a fine song that provides a nice change of pace, even though it doesn't quite fit in with the rest of 'Tales of Us,' an album whose strength lies in its ability to transport the listener not to the dance floor, but into a narcotic, hypnotized state.It's also an album in which the sum is greater than its parts, meaning it works better when listened to as a whole, as if it were a film. Each song builds off the previous one, to the point that the quiet beauty of string-laden closer \"Clay\" feels like it's almost soaring after the gloominess of all that came before. Taken individually, there are only a few standout tracks here. Collectively, they're nearly all standouts.(Originally written by me for Earbuddy.net)"
A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00DBISUN2,5.0,"&#34;Tales of Us&#34; is very different from the elector-pulsating albums many Goldfrapp fans are likely most familiar with. This isn't a dance party: it's a collection of moody, hypnotic, entrancing tracks that are hauntingly beautiful and mysterious. Goldfrapp constantly reinvents itself, and this might be the group's darkest album to date: and it's amazing. Love, love, LOVE it!"
A2I8B2GU6DPOB9,B00DBISVEU,4.0,"Loving his last album I picked this up the day it came out.The packaging is really sweet each of the flowers pop out a bit on the cover adding a nice effect.The vinyl came with an mp3 download, and came on a sweet clear pink purple vinyl that looks really cool (In my opinion better than the loser edition green).Unfortunately I wasn't to impressed with this album at first.The drums and rhythm was really bugging me. The vocals are pushed back in the mix and I wish they were a bit forward. After a few months of this album popping up on my Zune mp3 player I decided to give the album a full listen again on my turntable.I started to really enjoy it. I believe this album is a start to finish album and It really belongs on vinyl. Also, I had upgraded my speakers to Jbl 530 and started to hear a lot of detail on the vinyl that had been lost in the mp3 version. The drums and rhythm were more defined and the vocals stayed the same, but It blended well together.So If you were on the fence about this album just know it will grow on you; at least it did for me."
A10MUGGVSH49Z2,B00DBISVPE,5.0,"He's gotten some bad press lately...can't comment on his shortcoming...but as an artist he is my absolute favorite.  My car CD player has six slots, and everyone of them is Billy Currington.  I love his voice.  Truly a very gifted man."
A2Q4HZUGLXP6F1,B00DBO1YMK,5.0,"I put it in my car, and on my computer at work. It felt like Christmas wherever I went. The arrangements were interesting and comfortingly familiar."
A35QGTNWJTRGUG,B00DBQ0AV4,1.0,"If the look of desperation on the cover of the CD doesn't warn you, then nothing will. Other than an almost too lovely high Db at the end of the Macbeth Sleepwalking scene, the rest of the singing sounds like labored sight-reading. The voice lurches from one register to another, some of the trumpeted high notes are only approximate in pitch, what passes for coloratura/leggiero singing (e.g. Vespri) is clumsy at best,  and there isn't a characterization to be heard. I don't know who or what convinced Netrebko that she can sing Verdi roles any heavier than Violetta, Nanetta, or perhaps some of the very early lyric roles at this point in her career. This sorry album is more a tribute to Ponselle, Callas, Caballe, Price, etc., who were really qualified to sing this music and portray these characters on stage or in the recording studio with far less effort and far more credibility. This voice and this art form are both in big trouble, based on this recording."
A10ZTNFSUVSUDS,B00DBRT57S,1.0,"This is by far the worst band, and the worst \"music\" I have ever heard. I don't understand how they are supposedly number one with this album. What happened to imaginitive lyrics? Melody? Singing voices that do more than screech?? I love music, but this duo doesn't fall under that heading. If you want a good cd, I suggest purchasing ANYTHING but this. It's depressing, screechy \"music\" that will have every dog howling for miles. Seriously- check the racket out on youtube before you buy it!  Perhaps this is harsh, but sugar coating things does not alter the truth. I am sick of hearing this supposed band being lauded for their wonderful music when this is what they sound like.To those who rate this review as \"unhelpful\": May I remind you that you have your opinion, and that it does not necessarily coincide with my opinion or that of others. It is unreasonable to expect everyone to like this mess."
A24XQKM79FYFV0,B00DBRT57S,5.0,This was one of the best Alt Rock/Country/Folk albums released in 2013. That's not just my opinion. The album actually hit No. 1 on Billboard's 200 Albums back in August 2013. I only hope that whatever has happened between these two great artists and torn this fabulous duo apart will be healed and that they will once again create and perform great music such as on this album.
A2DDVIRY8OVYE1,B00DBRT57S,3.0,My first thought when I heard it was WHAT HAPPENED? As in why aren't they singing together and harmonizing perfectly and were they even in the same room together when they recorded this??? I loved the Barton Hollow album and how perfectly their voices meshed. This album was a let down for me because it's too much Joy and not enough John Paul. I'm not sorry I bought it but it was not at all what I expected. I played Barton Hollow almost every single day for at least 6 months and still play it weekly. This new album has been played 3 times and I've had it a month ... and only played that much to give it a chance. It's okay but it sure isn't near the complete perfection of Barton Hollow.
AJ4N7IY170DVQ,B00DBRT57S,5.0,"This album is quite different from their first album so it took me a few listens to get into it. But, it is a great album.  Both members have incredible voices and their harmonies are always spot on.  This album feels a little more country/gospel then the first album."
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B00DBRT57S,5.0,"It's tough to say what we should make of the back story of this album, which is that two artists whose voices and timing so beautifully matched (but were happily married to other people, and never romantically involved), apparently now cannot stand one another.  They called off a tour and the duo is, for all intents and purposes, disbanded.  Lover's quarrel?  Spousal jealousy?  Creative differences?  Who knows.In the meantime, their sophomore album is beautifully crafted and follows logically in a musical sense from \"Barton Hollow\".  The songwriting an musicianship is very good, but it's the vocal performance that sets them apart - I could listen to these two do an album of covers.  In fact, they effectively cover Smashing Pumpkins' \"Disarm\" and Etta James' \"Tell Mama\" towards the end of the album.  Here's hoping we get more from them because you can never have too many \"guitar and vocals\" groups when they do it this well."
A1Y51ENNZM6TVL,B00DBRT57S,5.0,Its no Barton Hollow but its pretty damn good to me! Im just happy they made another record after breaking up!
AQIA5GSVGL75I,B00DBRT59G,2.0,"' \"The most potent album of her career.\" --Pitchfork ' -- um, huh?  I feel like this critic is venturing dangerously into awkward hipster territory, saying something that off-base.  Here's mine: I LOVE Neko Case, but I just don't like this album.Now don't get me wrong, lyrically it's wonderful just like everything she's done.  Musically not so much. I am just not that into verbal poetry with a refried, vaguely Neko-case-like atmosphere in which to hear it.  That's my description of the album.  Maybe it hasn't hit me yet and I need to sit with it for a spell longer.At any rate, when I think of quintessential Neko Case, I think of both Blacklisted and Fox Confessor, not this.  The other albums just seem like fun house reflections, permutations, 2nd order derivatives of those two awesome albums, one spookily dark, and the other adventitious and sprightly.The track Local girl is obviously a hit.  But they can't all be winners or else none would stand out."
A4DPC95OZ6V18,B00DBVY66O,4.0,"This is one of the best debut album's I have had the pleasure of listening to in years.  The songwriting and musicianship is top notch and highly enjoyable to listen to.  So why 4 stars and not 5?  Simply put, the production quality on this album is terrible.  The producer and sound engineer did the band a great disservice in the way this album was cut and produced.  Most noticeably there is no sonic bloom, the quite portions of songs sound very similar to the louder more dynamic portions of songs.All that being said, this album is highly recommended and I can't wait to catch them live next time they come through town!"
AQV142R2H69QK,B00DBVY66O,4.0,"This is good old fashioned Heartland Rock which pays homage to bands like the Allmans, Black Crowes, The Eagles and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The Wild Feathers are: Taylor Burns - Lead Vocals/Electric Guitar, Ricky Young - Lead Vocals/Acoustic Guitar, Joel King - Lead Vocals/Bass, Preston Wimberly - Vocals/Lead Guitar and Ben Jarvis - Percussion. They hail from Nashville and they are brilliant in terms of channelling heartland rock into a fresh sounding approach which demands a brightly lit highway and a pair of Raybans. The more attentive Amazon reader will also notice that the band in effect have 4 lead vocalists and all write songs. When all the elements come together it works very well. Their single \"The Ceiling\" is a joyous example of the the type of seventies rock that colonised FM radio in the States and led to the possession of Lear Jets for its perpetrators. It is full of gorgeous high harmonies and wide open chords, the type of music that will sell by American Imperial Measure of the \"truckload\". With song titles like \"Left my woman\" you sort of get the drift of the subject matter they cover and this song brings flooding back the memories of the great \"Desperado\" heyday of Glenn Frey and Don Henley as the Feathers head off in the pursuit of Rock `n' Roll glory. Further tracks worth checking out include the funky rock \"I can have you\", the crunchy riffs of \"Hard Wind\" and the joie de vivre of \"Backwoods Company\". Unfortunately other songs such as \"I'm alive\" are straight out of the Tom Petty mould and on times the band are in danger of not so much wearing influences on their sleeve as sounding like karaoke.As a debut album \"The Wild Feathers\" shows real promise, but two points should be noted. Paying homage to your illustrious forebears is a well worn path which many new bands follow, yet in future releases it would be good to see Wild Feathers develop a clearer identity and seek a more distinctive voice. The biggest weakness however is the bands lyrics which need work often falling back on the use of cliched imagery and rudimentary basic rhyming. But let us end on a positive note since there are some clear signs here that a potentially great American band is in the making. They are certainly not there yet but The Wild Feathers are a band to watch and this album is worth the investment of your time and dollars."
A2XPG5G2MHCSRQ,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,"Buddy Guy sounds great, as usual. The guest tracks are some of the weakest, especially the Keith Urban number, but even those are pretty good. Amazing stuff for a man in his late 70s."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,"Its next to impossible to be a seriously into rhythm and blues and never have heard the name Buddy Guy for the last few decades. During the 90's blues revivals when a lot of younger musicians such as Johnny Lang and early John Mayer began carrying the blues torch, Buddy Guy was one of the last remaining people who'd lived the blues lifestyle. Came up with Muddy Waters,Howlin Wolf,John Lee Hooker and all the Chess greats and learned from them. Then after decades of plugging away starting getting all these special honors during when he was in his 50's. Somehow I never listened to his music. If you ever read my reviews, you know my feelings on the blues during that era. Well know that I understand the blues's intention,I am not mistaking its sentiments based on some of its listeners misinterpretations. In any case,its not easy to misinterpret the level of personality,attitude and sheer technique this guy possesses in abundance.This double album begins both of their discs with two enthusiastically nostalgic numbers in \"Best In Town\" and \"Meet Me In Chicago\"-both strongly funk heavy blues with some amazing horn charts and a right on time rhythm. \"Justifyin'\",\"Messin With The Kid\" featuring Kid Rock,\"What You Gonna Do Abut Me\" with Beth Hart and the brief but potent guitar jam of \"Rhythm Inner Groove\" are all hot grooving funk fueled R&B; with some amazing amped up solos from Guy. \"I Go By Feel\" has the cleanest organ/guitar breaks this side of Al Green and is lyrically very likely the manifesto of his whole musical ethic. Keith Urban shows up for \"One Day\",a really good linkage between sleek country and blues guitar at another kind of crossroads. \"The Devils Daughter\",\"Whiskey Ghost\" and much of the second disc such as \"Evil Twin\",featuring a spirit appearance by members of Aerosmith along with \"Never Gonna Change\",\"All That Makes Me Happy Is The Blues\",\"Blues Don't Care\" and \"My Mama Love Me\"-quite possibly the best \"mama song\" ever written go deep into Buddy's soul on everything from drinking to knowing the wrong kind of women.Buddy Guy is a very very astute person. He makes no bones on this album about the fact he's definitely been around. Somehow or other,his life experiences haven't been forgotten among all his accolades over the years. Hes still very much Buddy Guy-a cool man with a whole lot of groove. Even the guest stars on this album are extremely appropriate. They all bring in something very personal of their own front and center. And they always step back a bit and led Buddy just told the floor as he truly deserves. Another great aspect about this album is Buddy's maintaining the \"giving it back\" attitude he's always had with younger musicians-often jamming with them in his own blues club. Here is is doing the same thing with more contemporary people-a couple of whom have themselves been influences,and showing them just how its done. His music may seem like its from the guts. And maybe it is to a degree. But Buddy Guy is a great teacher too. And understands his music and how it should work. And speaking for myself when I hear the blues on this album,it makes me want to dance and makes me want to smile."
A14G7WIBGAPOQA,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,I got the cds on Monday from Germany and keep listening to it - the guitar is scorching and songs well done and written - it is a same milestone in his discography like damn right or bring em in
A1R4QJTMX111SJ,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,Very good double CD set.  Buddy Guy has that Muddy Waters feel and in the music you can hear the influence he received from others as well as that he had on Stevie Ray Vaughan and others as well.  The nice little surprises like Steven Tyler and others added some interesting and good twists.Pour a martini and kick back and enjoy!
A16BBY26HH1ZKO,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,If you like blues this is the album for you. This CD was recorded very well. This blues cd was put together very well with that I gave this blues album 5 stars
A3MN5U5RB7YR3P,B00DC3DGSK,4.0,"This is a double album of Buddy Guy at his finest. Classic Chicago style Electric Blues. I had the privilege to see Buddy Guy live in a small venue, and live he is really something to behold. This double album is Buddy at his finest. I'm surprise he still has it in him at his age, but he proved to me that he certainly does."
A3HV4VH1IWKXZS,B00DC3DGSK,5.0,Buddy Guy at his absolute finest!!!  We saw him a few years ago at the Hollywood Bowl along with BB King.  It's hard to believe that he's as old as he is.  Buddy shows the youngsters how it's done.
A2YHLBUF1OTDNN,B00DC8O7FG,5.0,"Wonderful!  This would be a good workout CD - not just for listening.Happy, up beat and lively.  Awesome lyrics too!Especially love &#34;In The Eyes&#34; -  I would have bought this CD for that song alone, but the other songs are just as good too."
A3ON1MH6X9B2LD,B00DCP006E,4.0,"Annihilator has always been one of my favorite bands. Seeing the fact no one knows them in the metal word is disappointing so hopefully this review will shine some light on this obscure band from Canada. 2013's \"Feast\" isn't the best album of all time, but it is a great surprise. At times it may be inconsistent but somehow, Jeff Waters makes it work.\"Deadlock\" is an old school speed metal track reminiscent of the old Alice In Hell days. The bass work is audible and the drums are powerful. Water's solo is good (as always) \"No Way Out\" Strange intro, but it builds steam and releases yet again another thrashterpiece of a song. The opening solo is great. The lyrics are thought provoking. Quite possibly the best song on the album. \"Smear Campaign\" Good head banging track. It gives your neck a break after the opening two tracks. \"No Surrender\" A jazzy bass intro starts things off (like an old Megadeth feel) The main riff is something you would hear from King Of The Kill (I love that). \"Wrapped\" NWOBHM intro. Incredibly old school. The low point of this track, lyrics are corny and popish. \"Perfect Angel Eyes\" Intro will remind the listener of something from Never Neverland. I will say I do like this song, the lyrics are strange especially for a metal band and for Annihilator but Jeff's guitar work makes it stick somehow. \"Demon Code\" Return the thrash. Highlight of the album, the lyrics deal with insanity, demons etc. Riffs are melodic and catchy and the main riff causes me to destroy random objects around town when I drive. \"Fight The World\" another hauntingly beautiful intro. Depressing with intricate bass work. The drum kit is demolished in the making of this track. The solo is killer. \"One fall, Two Rise\" Another melodic intro. Then will pick up to become a testosterone fueled thrash song.Overall, Annihilator has managed to release an album that surpasses the last one and (in my mind, ranks up in their top 5) Not saying that \"Feast\" is better than the classics as the lead singer is weak compared to the likes of the older guys. But he does manage to carry the weight of this technical thrash juggernaut of a band. Jeff has proven that time only increases his guitar mastership. And we also have an impressive showing from Mike Harshaw, the new fella on the drum kit. Annhilator's \"Feast\" is a worthy album of your hard earned cash, despite a few flaws here and there, this album will leaving you craving seconds!"
AYFW47AXYC1C,B00DCQ2DD6,4.0,"Witherscape The Inheritance is another fine release from the mind of Dan Swano.  Is this his greatest release, no it isn't, but it is very good.  I would describe the music as a mix of Heavy Metal, Death Metal, Doom Metal and Progressive Metal.  It's not really that straight forward, but mixes different elements together to make something a bit different from straight forward bands of one style.  My only real complaint is the CD is a bit short at just 40-minutes...can we get a new Nightingale record sometime soon Mr. Swano?"
A3TKL7X26QKKMO,B00DCRE1OE,5.0,"If there is one word to describe a band like Revocation, and that one word would definitely have to be impressive. Revocation are absolutely one of the best and most impressive bands in today's metal scene with such an amazing fusion of technical death and thrash metal with absolutely mindblowing results. Now as for the band's 2013 self titled album (their fourth full length release overall), I was very fortunate to come upon this CD at Best Buy just last year and I was extremely amazed with what I heard while listening to it, and the album immediately blew me away and I quickly became a fan of Revocation as a result afterwards. This epic monster of an album from it's straight ahead bludgeoning thrash attack of an opener \"The Hive\" to the floating in outer space feeling outro in the closing track \"A Visitation\" will rip and shred through your eardrums and have you coming back for more. The songwriting here on this album is very tight and very technical with extremely phenomenal musicianship throughout each song here. David Davidson is such an amazing young guitarist whose incredible playing skills with just blow your mind away. The album is just filled with amazing technical riffs and brilliant shredding leads and solos guaranteed to please any metal lover. David also proves himself worthy on lead vocals as well as his vocals are a mix between mid-range rasps and screams and occasional death metal growls and roars. His vocals definitely fit the music on here very well. And let's not forget about the rhythm section that consists of bassist Brett Bamberger and drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne who both do an excellent job at rounding off the rest of the band with Brett providing strong, solid bass work (especially on track five \"Fracked\" in particular), and Phil delivers a tight and commanding performance behind the drums with hammering fast thrash metal style beats mixed in with death metal blast beats along with plenty of ripping double bass pedal slamming and everything else in between.The self titled album kicks off with \"The Hive\" which is a blisteringly explosive opening track that starts with a creepy, haunting intro, and then before you even know it, the guys fire off their guns in a blazing, rapid steamrolling onslaught of rapid fire technical thrash riffs and double bass drumming as well as some blistering, jackhammer-like blast beats included, plus ferocious vocals as well as some great intricate soloing is also included, meanwhile the following track \"Scattering the Flock\" is a powerhouse groove metal oriented song featuring all around amazing riffage throughout, plus some drilling machine gun double bass pedaling as well as some more death metal blast beats thrown in too, plus more awesome soloing to boot. Next up, we have \"Archfiend\" which is my personal favorite song on the album and another brilliant monster of a song as it is highlighted by yet more brilliant technical riffs and leads throughout with a nice brief shredding solo by second guitarist Dan Gargiulo (who also shares guitar duties with David on the album) at 1:37, and then near the end of the song, things get very exciting when the band ventures into some progressive territory with a beautiful acoustic guitar passage which is then followed by an amazing melodic shredding solo by David to end it. The fourth track \"Numbing Agents\" meanwhile is another blazing and blistering thrasher that is highlighted by tight, fast and muscular riffing and fiery, air tight drumming, plus a very addicting chorus which also includes a really cool and gnarly riff to go along with it, and meanwhile \"Fracked\" is a more straight forward chugger which boasts heavy, meaty chugging riffs, plus some sweet, humming bass work as well as some outstanding melodic soloing to boot.Track six \"The Gift You Gave\" is yet another brilliantly epic song that starts off with a great opening melodic riff which then leads right into another series of amazing riffs, great double bass drumming and intense vocals throughout. The song later on features yet another beautifully executed melodic shredding solo by David, and there's also an awesome outro riff featured as well. After that, we have track seven \"Invidious\" which is another one of my favorites song on here that starts with a great building intro riff which then segues into a wicked banjo riff and the song then kicks straight into a pounding, headbanging onslaught with stomping drums, blistering riffs and raging screams, and it is also highlighted by an awesome bridge, plus yet another amazing solo by David, as well as a crushing, whiplash induced djent-ish outro riff to end it. Elsewhere, \"Spastic\" is a fantastic instrumental track that is filled with great riffage and excellent soloing throughout as well as some great odd time signatures added too, and track nine \"Entombed by Wealth\" is another fantastic mid paced epic that has a very sinister atmosphere and vibe to it throughout, and is highlighted by yet more killer riffage and great drumming throughout including some more blast beats during the first half of the song, plus a memorable chorus as well as an awesomely melodic yet very technical and lengthy dual solo section from David and Dan. The album's last track \"A Visitation\" is a very dark and ominous album closer that is highlighted by some stiff, marching double bass drum patterns, as well as some more occasional blast beats included, plus more awesome riffing and soloing, great vocals and an awesome outro riff that makes you feel that you're floating in outer space is also thrown in before fading out, thus ending the album.All in all, this is definitely an amazingly brilliant release from one of modern metal's best and fastest rising bands, and I've also have had the recent opportunity to check out some of Revocation's past releases as well, but this album thus far is definitely their best one yet in my opinion. Overall, I definitely recommend this to any metal fan young or old whose looking for something new and fresh. Trust me, Revocation is a band that truly demands your listening attention, and now that they have just recently signed with the legendary Metal Blade Records earlier this year and they're also working on a new album for release later on in the year, Revocation's fan base is guaranteed to grow even bigger and they truly deserve it...HORNS UP!!!\\m/"
A1IUUMOU9DNQYG,B00DCRE7W0,5.0,Memorable and very well put together.
A379KXLM6IJHIY,B00DCRE7W0,5.0,IS A GIFT TO A METALLICA FANS COULD NOT LISTEN FOR THE MOMENT AS YOU GIVE ME I WILL DO THE SAME COMMENT.
AAKSLZ9IDTEH0,B00DCRE7W0,3.0,"first i'm a BIG Jason Newstead fan he is solid from fltsam to vio-vod(which I believe he brought back to life F***yea!!)his work is normally top notch driving ozzy old ass to new life after years of boring!! this is nothing new or very original sounding to me Jason should have and could have done much more and much sooner.I hear he was doing project,touring,writing and surgery but he should have came out swinging in 2002-04 showing he WAS the energy in Metallica and the youth still at 40? Rob was good in ST but Jason remade Metallica juiced it up live better that he was allowed in the studio recording-and justice was godly but it need ed a bass player not 4 guitar parts and bass doubling the guitar riffs.Everyone know what I 'm saying but Jason needed to pull a metallica level not clone  LEVEL  sound and cd out to stuff james and the rest some thing great this is not it sub-pare! I wanted a lot more something I could say that's what metallica miss out on or maybe old school flotsam & jetsam feel but not rehashed just hard!it's not in this sounds like a young bands demo that had nothing to show,sadly."
ABGREXVTS8SHA,B00DCZCPAS,5.0,"I chose my rating based on what I heard on this cd. The music is new, fresh and ever so pleasing. What I liked about this cd is Paul Taylor always brings something new to the \"table\" that you didn't expect. He never repeats himself. Always giving you his latest and greatest effort. I would recommend this latest cd \"Tenacity\" to all smooth jazz listeners that value great sax playing coupled with smooth arrangements. A friend of mine made me aware of Mr Taylor about 10 years ago. An since that time I have purchase all his works from that point on. The year 2014 just just got so much better musically because Paul Taylor's sax is in the \"Mix\"."
A1CI5HBWL0C86N,B00DCZCPAS,5.0,He's such a fantastic artist ! I think he's so unappreciated as an sax player ! Great cd as always !!!!
A23KAGUO5T7VAX,B00DD348M2,5.0,"Meav is probalby  best known for being one ofo the founding members of Celtic Woman. While Meav was with CW for only a few seasons she helped set the standards that have made CW the international sensation that it is. Since leaving CW Meav performed as a guest vocalist on Orla Fallon's, also a fmr member of CW, 2009  Christmas CD/DVD and a c2011 PBS special \"Live at Chambord Castle\" with tow ohter international singing sensations. The Callng is Meav's first sollo CD since her pre CW days. It is a sensation. Her v ersion of \"First Time I ever Saw Your Face\" would have made Roberta Flack's mouth water with envy. The song \"The Calling\" shows why Meav is a power soprano.  She hits those high notes with perfect pitch with a voice as smooth a velvet. Listenning to Meav is a uplifting  ethereal experience. Other songs include the classic \"Shenandoah, Wayfaring Stranger Black is the Color and Glasgow\"Burning. All traditional music that Meav loves. Next to the Calling my favorite song is Sovay. Its a funny cheeky verson of the highwayman theme except its the woman who dresses as an outlaw. In disguise she robs her sweetheart demanding his gold, watch and diamond ring. He yeilds up his gold and watch but refuses to part with the diamond ring which is a token from his true love. Later when the ruse is discovered she explains she was testing him to see if he was a man or not. If he had given up the ring she'd have shoot him dead. Lession being don't mess with Irish women. You do so at your own peril. I fully expect Meav's newest CD to be nominated for a Grammy next year. If it isn't then the judges are deaf as well as being very very dumb. Thank you Meav for sharing your wonderful talent with your fans. If you love great music order this CD you will not be disappointed."
A1UCY0HSO92VRT,B00DDORVR0,3.0,"Well....we have enjoyed others in this series, but this one...not so much.  Perhaps it's just too foreign-sounding.  But don't let what I think deter you if you really love the kind of sounds Yo-Yo puts together."
A16M9D1CAK9JPU,B00DDRKDUO,5.0,Great band great music you will enjoy this music love it with headphones. They are also now touring America. Enjoy
A3VT7VGDWCIYYQ,B00DDVPXTG,5.0,"Good to be able to get several out of print CD's all in one.  This is the no frills approach - no extras, but to just have the music is worth the price."
A36GONCJEN8XLR,B00DE2G1DQ,4.0,"As a longtime fan, I enjoyed the new CD. At the same time, it really doesn't seem to add much to the Gogol Bordello canon. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the new songs. A standout for me was 'Malandrino', a sort-of romantic ballad (&#34;...I was born with a singing heart&#34;). Beyond that (and the driving 'We Rise Again', for example), most of it was more of the same. I guess I shouldn't complain. Even if it sounds a little like their last couple of albums, I've gotten some mileage out of all of them!"
A37HEYJWUGJHUK,B00DECS684,5.0,"I love these guys.  Stick it in your CD player, crank up the volume, lower the windows and just drive around late at night.  Yup, you will not be disappointed. This may be their best album yet.  The album has a raw, frat-rock sound that is hard to beat - I'm glad that after a long hiatus they have put out another album - it was worth the wait.  The CD sounds great."
A17JW64L3VICHX,B00DECS684,4.0,"The original lineup re-grouped in 2010, and now they&#8217;ve released a really nice CD of 1960&#8217;s R-N-B and R-N-R.  Nice to hear him and his boyz back in the game.  Hopefully they'll play Dallas."
AKB8X5WG9OA16,B00DEKKE7C,4.0,Blue October never disappoints! Have listened to this entire cd over and over and find a new favorite every time!
A1ZQYVC9PMNHFY,B00DEKKE7C,5.0,"I was really glad to here how good this CD is! In fact I was wondering if this is their best album to date. I've always been a fan, but since Foiled I felt much of their music was missing something. This seems more upbeat and a little different than what Blue October has done in the past. I really enjoy this new album and think many of the songs are really good!"
A3CF1BZ3LETD29,B00DEKKE7C,5.0,"Love this CD!  I've been a fan since I picked up Foiled (a few years back), and this one does not disappoint.  Even when the band and Justin Furstenfeld are expressing darker emotions (like on the Any Man in America CD, 2011) I still love the song structures and production/musicianship.  On 'Sway&#34; everything comes together in a beautiful way - production is lush and detailed, with awesome musicianship (as always), and the subject matter is more positive which lifts this up for a bit lighter experience.  Even so, the lyrics are still very moving and there is still some of the signature dark matter, which makes their music all the more rewarding.  If you are a fan, I'm sure you will enjoy, but if you have yet to listed to Blue October, this would be as good a place to start as Foiled, IMHO."
AR6MY3UPX08AD,B00DEKKE7C,5.0,"I am in love with this album! I haven't listened to any of their other stuff, but I will now. I love how emotional and raw it is but its sweet and hopeful. I recently went through a divorce and this album is where I hope to be soon...Thank you Blue October!"
A2ZQ34DLEU1SU1,B00DEKKEAE,5.0,"Excellent Blues/Jazz from a fave guitar player of mine. Everything is fresh on this cd. The audio samples don't do justice to how the full tracks groove. My money was well spent on this album. Jeff and Brian really work well together, and their chops are great!"
A16CZRQL23NOIW,B00DEPVML4,5.0,"I have been an unfaltering Ahmad Jahmal's fan since two decades ago. But like the good wine he improves with each recording. This album is overwhelming from start to finish.\"Saturday morning\", \"I'll always be with you\" and \"I got it bad and that ain't good\" are the best tracks of the cake.A fabulous CD for listening it at the sunset with a good company and a glass of wine..."
A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B00DEPVML4,5.0,"\"Play like Jamal\" Miles Davis used to instruct the keyboard players in his band, and always cited Ahmad Jamal as his great inspiration. Jamal might justify the title of \"greatest jazzman still alive & playing\" (though Wayne Shorter would also be a strong contender); ironic, as when pioneering the style for which he has become celebrated he was often dismissed by jazz critics in the 50s and 60s as \"a cocktail bar pianist.\"This latest release from the 83-year jazz giant demonstrates he is still the unassailable master of his craft, and shows no signs of retiring anytime soon. `Saturday Morning: La Buissonne Studio Sessions' was recorded in La Buissonne near Avignon, France and features the same quartet as 2012's `Blue Moon' ergo Reginald Veal on bass, Herlin Riley on drums and Manolo Badrena adding additional percussive flourishes to beef out the sound. In many ways BM & SM are companion albums, very much in the same style and with the same high production values.The overall groove on SM is a little more relaxed than BM (maybe due to the Provencal recording setting?) and the frenetic percussive flourishes of Badrena are less in evidence, his playing often taking a back seat. Ahmad's delightful virtuoso playing dominates the proceedings, with no sideman. There are more originals - 7 in total - than on the 2012 album, plus a few standards which receive the classic Jamal treatment of extended improvisation, always inventive, replete with good humor and occasional surprises. Production values are superb with everything sharp, clear and in perfect balance.Jamal is on record several times over the years confessing \"I think about my music all the time\" and it shows. His playing continues to astound and is, almost unbelievably, better than ever. More energetic and at the same time more subtle, you can never predict where his improvisations will go and to what new territories you will be transported.To top off a stellar and exemplary career with an all-time best album at age 83 is a trick rarely pulled off in the history of music, but Jamal seems to have done it. Way to go, Ahmad. Respect."
A1I8WRF2Y4D8ZL,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,This is another great addition to Neil's archive. I must compliment Neil on releasing all 5 of these live concerts he recorded over the years. The sound quality is excellent and I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan. Looking forward to the release of his Archives Volume 2.
ASTK6KKNE1HP7,B00DEPVNZO,3.0,"The LP was defective, not something I'd expect when purchasing a new one.  Skipped on side one between song 4 and 5, on both recordings.  Disappointing altogether experience."
A2SXCHTNMJIWCB,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"Early Neil - every song is outstanding and the performances are excellent and well recorded.Like most of Neil's albums, this one could be titled &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; and it would be accurate.This is a record of his marvelous work in the early part of his long career and the amazing thing is that he continued to meet this very high standard of song writing and performing ever since.  He changed himself a lot from album to album and explored new styles and revisited old ones, but never strayed from the standard of excellence that is so clear right here at the Cellar Door in 1970."
ABTIAH9WOGQL3,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"This album is really good and another slice of life from the time capsule of Neil Young's early years.  I love all the stripped down versions of this solo set and as in previous NYA releases, it reveals a goofiness in banter and stories to Neil that contrast with so many serious/ brooding images I've been accustomed to seeing in photographs over the years.  And I mean that affectionately, after all he was really just a kid when stardom came his way, totally earned with great songwriting and music, a huge contrast to the utterly untalented young &#34;artists&#34; who enjoy success today.  This is a definite add to the collection for any NY fan."
A3RJG9OFS49PJ,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,For fans of Neil Young this is a great live CD.  Almost sounds as if you're sitting there at his live performance.
AKJ87ZCIKUASO,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"I have picked up all of these Neil Archives releases thus far and have enjoyed them all to various extents, but I must say that after a half-dozen listens, this is my favorite in the series, at least to this point. The sound is quite good, Neil is personable, so on, so forth, but mostly this is a very strong collection of songs and Neil was at the top of his game on these performances.While, as a rule, I prefer loud, fuzzy Neil to sensitive, folky Neil, these solo performances could certainly lead me the other way, but I would also argue that they are tough, hard-edged performances. This is simply a marvelous disc. If you are an appreciator, you will want (and need) this. If you are new to Young, there are other obvious places to start, but if you're reading the reviews of a set from 1970, you're simply trying to find out if this one is worth getting. Most assuredly: It is."
A3WZJA30B4E8U,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"A must have for any Neil fan or any fan of 60's and 70's music. Love this CD!!!!! For a live recording, the acoustics are excellent. Neil's voice and musicality are peak."
A4OA4UWH4DPG7,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"A former Washington DC resident who knew the Cellar Door (and their larger productions) well, I can tell you the sound quality of the CD is amazing.  It is a coffee house type concert, sounds like no more than 50 or so in the audience, and it is just Neil doing solo what he does best.  A must for any fan.  Think the acoustic side of &#34;4 Way Street&#34; with better sound, and just Neil."
A2QNGLU29QNCBT,B00DEPVNZO,5.0,"This album is a terrific example of Neil Young's earlier work - powerfully earthy and raw.  I saw Neil when he was with Buffalo Springfield when they performed in a small teen dance club in a small Midwest town in the 60's when Buffalo Springfield was the number one band in the country with the number one hit in the country \"For What It's Worth\".  A memory that I will never forget - two teen-aged girls glued to the stage while the band performed to a crowd of 50 (maybe) like it was arena-worthy instead of a teen club.  Been a fan ever since - some things you never forget.  I loved that Neil put some Buffalo Springfield songs on this album as his song writing skills are exceptional.  One of my favorites is \"Flying on the Ground is Wrong\".  Although Neil states this song is about drugs, it could be interpreted in many different ways.  The lyric \"I wish I could have met you in a place where we both belong\" is a beautiful emotional lyric.  His hit \"Cinnamon Girl\" is great here on the piano - toned down and simplified.  \"Don't Let it Bring you Down\", \"Expecting to Fly\", great songs along with \"Old Man\" another one of his hits.I think it's wonderful when these artists bring back their earlier work so fans can appreciate the beginnings of their career.  For Neil Young fans, this is a must album."
A3P09BMWW9J3RH,B00DETP4GO,4.0,"After being thrillled by his &#34;All Rebel Rockers&#34; and his &#34;&#34;Yell Fire&#34; CDs, although his &#34;All People&#34; disk didn't really sink in (the first time II played it), after a second and third listen, he again impressed me with his special style.

A3GKOOYNYL72P3,B00DG86AKM,5.0,"My longest and probably most glowing review was of &#34;Weather Systems&#34;, and like many followers of Alt/prog music, I find  this band's low profile a mystery.I agree with the glowing reviews of this 2 disc set, the works taken from We're here..., Weather Systems and Disaster....This concert with the Plovdiv Orchestra is an absolute gem, and a kick in the guts for those who think this brand of music does not fit with orchestral treatments.So many concert Films don't do justice to the bands. This is a rare exception.The music is all.Vincent Cavanagh is at his heartfelt best, Lee Douglas Shines, and the playing of the whole band is flawless.Add to that the moody, rather atmospheric yet careful cinematography, and top notch sound and a warm ambience.And, for all that, quite emotional.The vision near the end, of Vincent Cavanagh, standing, arms resting on his instrument, at once soaking up the audience adulation, yet offering himself in some strangely humble way....great cinema.For those of you trolling the modern music world for something new, start with this DVD/CD set.For Anathema fans wondering, wonder no longer.Buy this or I'll phone yer Mums."

A5KLI4C6QAJN1,B00DG9PR3M,5.0,"Remember hearing that Ace was nice on the mic by several different people never won me over. But I coped the trials & tribulations CD and while driving from out of town with a ear that was at full attention.WOW! This hands down will be the most slept on album of the year (ALONG WITH N.O.R.E). It has real topics and story lines that most listeners can relate to or at least appreciate. Ace gives much respect to the man up above and with great guest appearances (Chris Brown,Lil Wayne,Meek Mills,Anthony Hamilton,Rick Ross & an All-Star Remix Cast)also.The best part is he's doing it at this level minus all the profanity. LOVE IT BUY NOW!"
A1MYXMFYTY0607,B00DGGIXS6,3.0,This was not the Cher we're used to.None of those big thumping balladsand far too personal and self reflective for my taste.I prefer the BIG Cher with the great electric music and powerful words that apply to us all
AUNE5MUAWOAY0,B00DGGIXS6,2.0,"After reading all the reviews on here about auto  tune on the vocals(I would assume you people will not be seeing her live then as she lip synchies right ?? ). I'm alittle baffled . If you mean the electronic sound effects on her voice . I think she went with the sound because of the producers she worked with said \" its the  in sound effect and everyone  is doing it \" . Similar to the garbage w/ the robot sound effects that Madonna has put out as of late... I question the accusations here it is because her voice is too weak on its own  but being more about Cher not saying \" Hey, i'm Cher and i'm not going to have my release sound like Lady Ga-ga or Pink with all the electronic voice crap . I'm doing this my way , with MY voice not having effects !!( remember the 70's bands that followed the trends of the 80's that the producers and labels told them they should do from the production of the music to the clothes and how bad that is looking back now ? )The real problem here is the songs. I was very excited to see that she was going to put out another release but, the upbeat songs are typical, boring, sound like everyone else ( except for the vocals ) and , have the same stupid club beat thru out that we started seeing on Living Proof with one minor difference. Those songs were good !The ballads are very boring and generic too.Living Proof and especially Believe ( although they didn't have her biggest hits  ) were the best releases of her career  imo . Song after great song . And, great songs for her to perform to live .Too bad as all the people that work around her and Madonna all drink the Kool-Aid and are too afraid to say anythingI know when she sings songs off this release in concert I will be going to the bathroom and getting another beer."
A23I4TZSZYSY1Q,B00DGGIXS6,5.0,"Nobody but Cher could be releasing a passionate banner release some fifty years after her original album debut to such a tremendous amount of deserved fanfare, make no mistake stellar release \"Closer To The Truth\" finds the wild Diva in peak form, distinctive glorious passionate voice brilliantly showcased in a richly varied set of songs tailor made for the iconic legend, from many recent appearances the amazing lady looks as great as she sounds!Out of the gate \"Woman's World\" is a jammin' grand slam #1 dance hit sensation making one want to get up and move, exactly what thousands of excited fans were doing in New York during recent exhilarating & eventful live morning performance, showing Cher as musically relevant today as in the sixties, seventies, eighties on through to the nineties when \"Believe\" became the mega-blockbuster to date of her phenomenal recording career.\"Closer To The Truth\" grows fast on the lucky listener upon repeated play, filled with a diverse collection of captivating gems each having their own unique feel, soaring & passionate ultimately soul-deep inspired heart & soul vocals from Cher being among the finest of her prodigious recording career...just announced Spring 2014 tour \"Dressed To Kill\" is certain to be the must see sold-out event of the season!

A1CK4J7YRAUQ53,B00DGGIXS6,5.0,This is the album of Cher's career I absolutely love it. This is an album most artist never get  fantastic from start to finish. Great going lady & I'll be seeing you on tour next year!
A2VXIOXUPGGZQ5,B00DGGIXS6,2.0,"I was expecting that this would be her best album ever, based on the hype.  It did not live up to expectations, and certainly not to the hype.  The music is okay, but nothing special.  If you are a dedicated Cher fan, then you might want this to complete your collection; but it will not be in the same class as the &#34;Best of&#34; album."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B00DGGIXS6,4.0,"Great to have a new album by Cher. I knew WOMAN'S WORLD from seeing Cher perform it on TV months ago. It's a good song with hooks galore. The first 6 tracks are all loaded with dance music. Cher going EDM is nothing new, and some of these songs will become anthems, just by the titles alone indicate. TAKE IT LIKE A MAN is another catchy track. DRESSED TO KILL is going to be the name of her new tour. Mark Taylor , the writer of BELIEVE produced and wrote half of the songs on this album and loaded it up with dance tunes, but also contributed a couple of surprises that veer away from the dance floor. I wish that the Auto-Tune effect was not used on some of these songs. It has become old hat now, and Cher can sing and belt out a song. She does not need a novelty effect like this on another album. After 6 songs that are pounding dance tracks with programming overload, and quite wordy as well, I am glad to hear another side of Cher on the next 5 songs. Thinking of it as an album, Side 1 is dance/EDM, and Side 2 is pop and rock. I WALK ALONE is a splendid tune that starts with banjitar [ that's what the credit lists it as ] and sounds like an influence of of I Walk Alone with Turn Turn Turn lyrically with some marvelous footstompin' effects. SIRENS is a beautiful atmospheric song with Cher giving one of her greatest vocal performances. SIRENS is the strongest song on this album, with Cher's powerful vocals, a guitar solo and a haunting ambience that surrounds this song. For fans that like Cher's rock side, the mesmerizing SIRENS is up there as one of her best songs ever. FAVORITE SCARS, I HOPE YOU FIND IT and LIE TO ME all complete the rock ballad side. Cher has said she's not a big fan of her music, but the last 5 songs are more traditional Cher pre-Believe.  In her long career of nearly 50 years, Cher has sang a wide variety of styles and genres. Everyone has their favorite sides of Cher, songs, and albums or films. I like this one, though it's not her high water mark. She's done it all, and everybody loves some Cher."

AYD5G172A3CDP,B00DGGIXS6,1.0,"Anyone who knows me that I love Cher and am a huge fan.  I loved her last album, \"Living Proof\", and had been waiting for 12 years for her to release a new album.  So you can imagine my disappointment of having waited 12 years for garbage like this.This album is flat-out TERRIBLE!  The music is so generic sounding and dated and the Auto-Tuned vocals on every song are horrific.  She doesn't even sound human on most of the songs.  The vocoder vocals may have been cool on \"Believe\" and \"Living Proof\", but in 2013, they are really getting tired thanks to the fact that almost every artist on the radio today goes overboard with the Auto-Tune.  Cher has a good, unique voice and she doesn't need this garbage.  But back to the music - the songs are plain and you can hardly tell when one song starts and when one song ends because they all just run together since they all sound the same.The lyrics are ridiculous as well - on \"Woman's World\", she sings about \"dancing on the club floor\".  I'm not ageist, but lets get real: it's silly for a 67 year old to be singing about going to the clubs.I can't imagine this album becoming a success - the first single \"Woman's World\" was such a flop that it only charted at #125, so that says a lot, especially considering it's the only decent song on the whole album.  Cher really should have ditched the generic dance music and Auto-Tuned vocals and went back to rock."
A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B00DGGIXS6,5.0,"There are legends and there is Cher! Simply put this lady keeps getting better with age and shows no signs of slowing down. Her latest CD, \"Closer To The Truth\", is by far my favorite album by this Diva. Really a collaboration between pop and dance styles Cher wisely chose to record songs for this album that appeals to her ardent fan base and we couldn't be happier. Her voice is strong, the songs catchy and innovative and the production first-rate.On the first week of release \"Closer To The Truth\" went all the way to #3 on the all-important Billboard Album Chart signifying Cher's biggest debut sales of any of her records.Highlights here are \"Woman's World\", \"Take It Like a Man\", the title track and \"I Walk Alone\"."
A3SQAGK4Y1Z9GE,B00DGO8CL6,5.0,Elton just keeps getting better with Age - this particular album gets even better with each playing.  It really grows on you. Hope there's a few more left in him yet!
AJ1EG0GB1QAXF,B00DGO8CL6,5.0,"it seems like before the pop side of Elton took over, the Elton who made his self title album, Tumbleweed and Madman came out of retirment to create this album. Older, Wiser with a deeper voice but wonderful talent intact, he created a modern verison of those early albums. Elton;s melodies and Bernie's lyrics have never sounded better:) Producer T.Bone Burnett really knew the direction to take this new music. I welcome comments."
A2AJ57CG4T153E,B00DGO8CL6,5.0,"When I was young I had all the Elton John albums (pre-CD days).  This was a &#34;must have&#34; since somehow all my old vinyls haven't made it with me into my golden years.  This is solid, frequently introspective and mature Elton John.  The flame of the old days is still there in about half the selections and I found the balance to be more subdued and inward-looking.  A thoroughly enjoyable disc.  The various recordings are uniformly well-balanced and all the inner lines in support of John's vocals are just as they should be.  Glad I got it."
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00DGO8CL6,5.0,"2012 proved to be a horrible of year in the music industry. No artists or legend has ever felt that hardness and heartbreak further than Elton John. With so many losses from artists he had befriended from Donna Summer from Cancer, Levon Helm of The Band, the unbelievable Whitney Houston and her passing before the Grammy Awards, to friends and people he had lost who worked behind the scenes of music from the deaths of Dick Clark years after his stroke in 2004 of American Bandstand fame and Don Cornelius from Soul Train, which Elton had appeared in 1973 on the show performing Bennie & The Jets. Elton had so much heartbreak he had faced. But what was suppose to be a joyous year for him and Bernie Taupin which would celebrate 45 years of songwriting together, proved to be sadness down the road. It set the intimate scene for what had been his strongest record since the 90's with the albums Made In England & The One.The Diving Board is definitely a straight forward return to the simplicity of the piano and what made Elton a great performer in the first place. The songs and record shows the down to Earth stripped-down appeal from the piano well, and the somber moods from the piano, guitar and drums. Elton shows that appeal well from his songwriting on great songs that range well from the moods from the Blues on songs like Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight,) and The Ballad Of Blind Tom, which focuses on younger artists thinking they have fame but get screwed up along the way like Lindsay Lohan who has no career right now and Justin Bieber whom thinks he has everything but has lost it in his fame. The moods from the ballads speak loud in the piano as well from songs like the beautiful and somber Home Again, to the opening song Oceans Away and the mood-shattering The New Fever Waltz. It definitely shows well from the intimate set of the song. The settings from each dream track each work out too from the settings of the songs. While My Quicksand might be the one off-shoot that might not work, the feeling catches up with you in the song well.What David Bowie tried to attempt with The Next Day earlier this year, Elton John took it very well to that next level with The Diving Board. It definitely holds up nicely with Elton John's classic records from the past well. While everyone from Katy Perry and Rihanna try too hard to overexpose their music and they became tiring and more wasted, Elton still has found his heart well and wanted to make the records he has wanted too. While he is past his success from the 70's, Elton has no signs of stopping. I absolutely recommend this record not only because it is one of Elton John's finest masterpieces, but we really do not have legends making music for the way it should be heard anymore. What T-Bone Burnett did with Elton John and Leon Russell on The Union 3 years ago, he took it further with The Diving Board. We really do not have legends anymore delivering masterpieces, but I am glad Elton John is still standing with great strength after all this time.Album Cover: B+Songs: APrice: A 1/2-Mastering: A 1/2-Overall: A-"
A1FE60PSQ2SWR9,B00DGO8CL6,4.0,"What can be said about Elton John's  new CD - The Diving Board, that hasn't been said already?Some people thinks it his best work and remind them of his past CDs of the 70's, some people don't get it and others are disappointed.Elton has been recording great music since 1970 and it is undeniable, throughout his career he has provided us with some of music's best loved songs and biggest hits. And like any real creative person in this business, he will never stand still for too long, it is expected he will always do something new. But what ever Elton does you can be sure it will be full of heart, integrity, and good music. And The Diving Board is full of these qualities. On the Diving Board, Elton is being true to himself, and in the process has created a very strong and musical CD, stripping away the layers of production on the songs and revealing true quality musicianship. Of course part of the credit must go to Bernie Taupin, his song writing partner for most of Elton's career.Basically this is a piano CD fill with great mid tempo songs without any over dubs and big production in the songs. There are no fillers on this CD, all the songs have something special and mentionable in each of them, whether it is Elton piano playing, which is up front throughout the CD; his performance of the songs, which vary from song to song; the lyrical content of the songs and how well they translate into the music.It was believed that The Diving Board would probable only resonate most with his long time fans, but it should be noted that this CD debuted at #4 in the Billboard's Top 200 albums. This for an CD that the first single, Home Again is not being bombarded on the airwaves. Maybe the buying public is ready for some real music from a real super star!Personally I think Elton is once again on the edge of the diving board ready to make a splendid dive into the wide unknown.Good luck Elton!!!"
A12224Y2TZG4BY,B00DGO8CL6,3.0,"Elton John will never ever sound vocally or even remotely musically like he did in the 70's.  For those of you like me who bought this thinking maybe things were going to get better and Elton would sound like he did in his heyday, you are going to be disappointed.  The songs on this album plod along a track and never seem to go anywhere.  Elton simply cannot hit the high notes like he did when he was younger and even his keyboard playing reflects this.  As far as the quality, music will never sound as good as it did before anyway because of the way engineers record music all on the same level now with no dynamic range.  Bernie Taupin's lyrics have changed as well so you cannot expect the same sort of songs that were produced back in the 70's either.  Elton has always bragged that he can write a song in less than an hour.  I'm afraid it's starting to show.  That's hard to say because I've been a fan of his since I was a teenager - back when Elton used to be a real showman and do handstands on his piano.  We cannot expect that sort of drive from Elton anymore.  He's aged and his music has aged but not as well as we would have liked it to."
A1TMCZ13AXWV5,B00DGO8CL6,4.0,"For one thing, the piano is front and center, not drowning in a swirl of session players, and Elton is simply one of the three or four best rock piano players in history.  Secondly, the songs are stripped down and a little bit country-tinged, the melodies are strong, and Taupin's lyrics are more direct than usual (mostly).  I've bought two or three of his last LPs out of a sense of duty and then stopped listening.  This one I'm playing all the time."
A2S7XWDFR9GSPZ,B00DGO8CL6,5.0,"It's obvious that Elton put an extra amount of time into this album.  I've been a fan of his since a very young age and I find myself not getting tired of this one at all.  Any person with an ounce of good musical taste won't be disappointed in this album.  Also, Elton sounds great for being 66 years old and his playing seems to have an added touch of passion to it.."
A3AIPY438KNXUS,B00DHIVFZQ,2.0,"Jourgenson reminds me of George Carlin.  No, wait; hear me out.  Like young Carlin, young Al was creative and groundbreaking.  But like old Carlin, old Al is bitter, strident, and disappointed, and that's what this album is.  It's Al the Producer on automatic, and with his skill and experience he can't fail to create somewhat interesting audio landscapes.  But as songs, these landscapes are failures.  The lyrics -- never Jourgenson's strong suit -- are incredibly weak, more like spoken-word rants devoid of any kind of imagery whatsoever.  The music itself, like I said, can be interesting to listen to a couple of times but there's nothing new in their bags of tricks and no groove in most of the songs, just overproduced samples, programming, and exploding drum machines.  I can't say I'm hugely disappointed -- I pretty much knew what I was getting in to after listening to RELAPSE a couple times -- but this album proves that Al needs to hang up Ministry and just produce."
A1K3NQAO49LXL2,B00DHIVFZQ,4.0,"It's easy to deride this album as being Ministry's final-final-final album (there had been so many), but of course this one would never have happened were it not for the sudden death of long-time Ministry collaborator, guitarist Mike Scaccia, who in true rock `n' roll tradition, died onstage rockin' out. RIP Mike.The album is fantastic, and a great epitaph and eulogy for the great band and the great guitarist. It is also the most eclectic and experimental Ministry album, at least since the early days, and a great listen. The title is a bit silly, but I guess \"eternity\" means something, and Al still likes his beer (he may have gone back into rehab for beer recovery, since - according to his autobiography, released the same year as this album - he had given up everything else and needed at least something to keep his buzz going. \"Hail To His Majesty (Peasants)\" is a weird, hateful thing that is full of bizarre electronic sounds, it is more avant garde than Ministry has been for a very long time, and it zooms around and around in weird trajectories, including a section of great Ministry sounds, some nice stomp, and some interesting industrial sounds, samples, everything. Very interesting. \"Punch In The Face\" is a cool, scratchy thing, quite different from any other Ministry song, that is a bit more measured than the opening track, but just as weird and bloopy, although it still has a cool needly solo. Great layers, and goofy samples! \"PermaWar\" sounds a lot like the opening song from Relapse, with its strange drawling singing style (not Al's best), and there's also a huge female chorus (!?!?). Meh... \"Perfect Storm\" is a big nutso stomp that just goes on and on! It's nearly a punk song... \"Fairly Unbalanced\" is a nutty guitar song about Fox News' reporting, with lots of crazy dialogue samples. It's a pretty big song. \"I would vote for George Bush even if he was barbecuing babies on the White House lawn.\" \"What we want to get back is to where our country was 100 years ago.\" Cool \"pound away at\" sample loop and echo, which blends the song into \"The Horror\" - some great goofing around here, with electronics and sound, and samples like \"God intended\" and \"legitimate rape.\" Yeah!! \"Side Fx Include Mikey's Middle Finger (TV 4)\" goes all over the place, starting off with some righteous thrash that pummels and punishes all over the place. In the middle there's a whole section of weird goofing around, more samples (medical, for the most part), and then it gets back to full rock mode, and then just goes all over the place into nutty remixing. \"Lesson Unlearned\" is sort of a funk song with all sorts of jazzy female vocals. \"Thanx But No Thanx\" is probably the best song on the album, starting off as a reggae bust-up, before zooming into character-speech, Al as some sort of redneck ex-marine William Shatner/Ted Nugent sort of voice. It gets into a very dynamic number that zooms around a lot, with a very silly-sounding guitar solo. \"Change Of Luck\" starts off with some cool near-acoustic mellow guitar riff, then some strange Middle Eastern mood buildup, Over eight minutes, and the longest song on the album. Eventually we get to some chorus, a whole bunch of other stuff, a guitar solo, nice. \"Enjoy The Quiet\" is a short and sweet electronic ambient noise zoom, and that's it.This probably could have been mixed as a Revolting Cocks album, as it's closer to RevCo in spirit and experimentation, but Mike Scaccia was closer to Ministry than RevCo, so this is a proper homage to the man. RIP."
A3M9ULK9QECAMX,B00DI1J680,2.0,"Political music in 2013 doesn't have to be overt. In fact, in an age where EVERYTHING is politicized, people seem to be finding music more and more as a retreat from the political world. That is NOT to say political music no longer has it's place.  However, if you're going to spend your time and efforts being as \"politically active\" or \"socially conscious\" as No Age, then expect some blowback if the music doesn't satisfy enough to activate your troops.Every update from No-Age prior to the release of \"An Object\" was about what they were currently railing against, whether Converse or Wal-Mart or some other corporation run by white men who, if you listen to No Age, wake up thinking about how they can screw over the world.So then the music arrives and it is reverb-laden punk, as expected, but where are the tunes?  They simply aren't there - no classics, but hardly anything that makes you want to stay interested.No-Age's focus here seems to be on the artifact as an agent of change.  That's not going to work.  If you want to inspire then you need to write some \"Masters of War\"'s or \"Rock the Casbah\"'s.  But they present us with \"An Object\".  A sarcastic name playing on the fact that an album is, in fact, an object.  Great, Ian MacKaye was more poignant on that point a generation ago.  This \"object\" you've presented also has music on it.  As a water-bottle is an object serving as a vessel for water, so a CD or Vinyl or MP3 serves as a vessel for music.  If the music is crud, showing signs of a band that spends more time getting attention for the non-musical output, then nobody will want the object.  But, as anti-everything as No Age seems to be, maybe that was their point."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DI1J680,4.0,"I saw No Age in concert recently (more on that later) and afterwards decided to check out their new album. I was a big fan of the band's debut album, 2008's \"Nouns\", but sorta lost track of them after that. This is the duo's 4th album.\"An Object\" (11 tracks; 30 min.) starts off with a fast-and-furious \"No Ground\", which reminds me of the Ramones. \"I Won't Be Your Generator\" is more traditional, if you can call anything done by this duo (Dean Spunt and Randy Randall) traditional. \"C'mon, Stimmung\" goes back to the band's punk roots, as does \"Defector/ed\". But after that, the album takes a left turns and becomes far more impressionistic and introvert, check out \"An Impression\", and also \"My Hands, Birch and Steel\" as well as the album's closer \"Commerce, Comment, Commence\". Somehow it all works. At just 30 min., this album clicks by in no time and you'll find yourself playing this again and again.I saw No Age in concert at the FYF in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago. Live they are a full band, not just a duo, and they brought a loud, fantastic-sounding set that was filled with energy and fury. They played a bunch of songs from this new album, including No Ground, I Won't Be Your Generator, Circling With Dizzy, etc. (none of the slower/introspective songs from the album, you might notice), along with some nuggets from the past like Teen Creeps from \"Nouns\". A great set from an equally great music festival (it was my first time attending the FYF). Meanwhile, check out \"An Object\", you won't be disappointed."
A1YC0PWZDH50HP,B00DJ80VL8,1.0,"im a fan of mark tremonti, but this fortress cd is just plain aweful..they recorded it too loud and with too much on the high end..have to turn  my treble down quite a bit..its not so much the songs in questioned, but hell i cant hardly listen to it b/c of all the screeches..so really, the production just sucks on this cd.."
A26GNODC9E943H,B00DJ80VL8,5.0,Fantastic album AGAIN by these guys.  Things seem stepped up a little bit in regards to some aspects of the music...
A3URKHI41Y29TX,B00DJ80VL8,3.0,"I've been a fan of Alter Bridge since One Day Remains along with being a fan of Creed.  I must say that I am surprised by all of the five star reviews and critical acclaim Fortress has been receiving.  When I first listened to the record I was actually pretty disappointed in some of the songs.  I was not impressed with the first single \"Addicted to Pain\" because it felt like it was just a thrashier version of some songs from ABIII.  I decided to give the album a shot anyways because I enjoyed their past records a lot.  However, along with \"Addicted to Pain\", many of the songs appear to have similar sounding melodies that appeared on ABIII scattered throughout.  On the other hand, aside from those songs there are four outstanding tracks that are among Alter Bridge's best.  These are \"Lover\", \"Peace is Broken\", \"Calm the Fire\", and of course the Best Buy bonus track \"Never Say Die\" (I say \"of course\" because many bands tend to leave outstanding songs as bonus tracks).  It would be crazy if the songs \"Peace is Broken\" or \"Lover\" were not to be released as singles as I believe they would fare better than \"Addicted to Pain\". Two other noteworthy tracks are \"Bleed it Dry\" and \"All Ends Well\".  As for the others, sure they are heavy and have stellar guitar work, but they all share similar tempos, tone, and melodies we've all heard on their previous record.  If you are new to Alter Bridge, then try purchasing their previous records before this one."
A3IONYEMNKKS2H,B00DJ80VL8,3.0,"Similar to previous from them, this is a good CD. There are a few really great songs, but most of it is pretty average.  Not terribly impressed, but not really disappointed."
A1ZQYVC9PMNHFY,B00DJ80VL8,5.0,"This CD is really good, better than all their past releases and it rocks from beginning to end. I've been a fan from the start and after Myles CD with Slash I really think he has come into it and the rest of the band sounds tighter! My one issue with Myles has been resolved and I think it is three times better. The lead singer has slowed down his lyrics a little bit, and you can hear everything he is saying and even sing along a little bit. The band as a whole sounds great, and if you compare how he sings on this album to some of his older stuff you will see what I mean. I think he has a great voice but his tweaking has made it all that much better!"

ASVNSWIXBV72Q,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"It would be both true and misleading to say that progressive metal gods Dream Theater have built their career and almost untouchable back catalogue based on routine. See, New York's finest imports have long ago mastered the art of extreme sports musicianship (and they still, to this day, remain the source of some of heavy music's best guitar work), but they have always left some room for growth in their songwriting. (Or maybe \"growth\" isn't the best word to describe their songwriting -- so, in its place, consider the terms \"expansion\" and \"inventiveness.\") Hence, the only thing you have come to expect from this band over the years is the unexpected.On proper full-length number twelve, D.T. continue to push the envelope and innovate, and when considering what they have already done, that is really, really saying something. Sure, this eponymous 2013 release offers enough heavy stuff to viscerally-satisfy all fans of their aggressive side, but they also traffic in plenty of refreshingly new and inventive songs. (After all, how many Dream Theater records before this one can be said to feature an epic that cracks the twenty-two minute barrier?!) As such, \"Dream Theater\" (the album) is a wildly audacious effort, but it never bogs down too much in prog-rock wankery, or meanders without losing site of what the band want to accomplish.\"False Awakening Suite: Sleep Paralysis/Night Terrors/Lucid Dream\" is a very dramatic set opener, and despite being a largely instrumental piece, it is strangely accessible, especially when considering the source from which it came. See, it clocks in at just two minutes and forty-two seconds in length, and one that lays twin-guitar harmonies and a lightly-plucked string arrangement against cinematic synth lines, and layered, operatic-sounding backing vocal melodies. But immediately following this, though, comes a blistering, full-on metal song in \"The Enemy Inside,\" which displays D.T. at their angriest and most aggressive by charging forward with fiery, thrash metal-derived chugging and fast, dexterous drumming. Even some death metal-esque elements find their way into the mix into this, here, believe it or not, but the guitar leads -- which alternate from harmonic to wah-wah-inflected -- and solos (which are very wailing) remain classic progressive metal. And with all of this going on, it might be easy for one to forget about the vocals, but James LaBrie does, as a matter of fact, have his place in this song, because he soars over the top of the whole thing with a clean singing voice that is unsurprisingly accomplished and infectious.After that comes \"The Looking Glass,\" a tune that plays like an obvious tribute to Canadian prog-metal pioneers Rush, as is evident especially in its melodic vocals, crunchy guitar licks, and soaring chorus hooks. And a big, arena-anthem-esque vibe is also present, here, thus helping to further this point. But \"Glass\" is also of note for its use of twiddly, Yngwie Malmsteen-ish guitar wailing and a solid, underlying bass grumble. The succeeding \"Enigma Machine,\" however, is like the aforementioned \"The Enemy Inside,\" because it is a bit of an album anomaly by bringing the heaviness back in convincing fashion. After beginning with a twinkling keyboard intro, the commanding electric guitars storm onto the scene with huge, lumbering, pure doom metal riffage. This entirely instrumental, six minute-long epic features some deliciously mazy and screaming guitar soloing (seriously, \"Enigma Machine\" is an air-guitarists wet dream, as it is home to some of the album's finest and most complex and technical guitar work). But it also features a grumbling bass bottom, and a pounding, driving rhythm, and terrifically deft and dexterous drumming (including one especially awesome and energetic drum fill at around five minutes in). The song undergoes numerous tempo and arrangement change-ups, but no matter how complex and varied it may get, it always manages to retain a certain adherent groove by frequently returning to its main riff.\"Dream Theater\"'s centerpiece comes in the form of \"The Bigger Picture,\" a dreary, ethereal, and acoustic-strummed ballad that nears the eight-minute mark. And even though this tune gradually picks up momentum and eventually adopts a few heavy riffs, it possesses a certain, concertedly melodic edge, though, which is a fact that is mostly due to Labrie's clean (and at times almost soulful) singing, thus giving the arrangements another distinctly Rush-esque vibe. Up next is \"Behind The Veil,\" a seven-minute-long epic that unfolds slowly, building from snaking, serpentine keyboard lines to a driving metal attack of punishing, locomotive rhythms, groovy thrash riffing, and precise drumming. Some interesting, thrummed bass work finds its way into the thick of things, and, of course, guitarist extraordinaire John Petrucci rips out plenty of wailing, amazing solo flights with seemingly impossible ease, too.Moving along, a lot more steep and epic melodic guitar soloing pierces the air in \"Surrender To Reason.\" But that isn't the only thing that this song has going for it -- it also boasts a steady, chugging main riff, downtuned bass lines, and surprisingly wild and shredding guitar leads. The inclusion of orchestral-like backing vocal chants, richly textured keyboard flourishes, Opeth-flavored melodic vocal lines included, too, to make the arrangements sound that much fuller and epic, as is the occasional spot of acoustic strumming. And the ensuing \"Along For The Ride\" continues in this melodic and subdued vein, as a lovely, warm, and just plain gorgeous, piece of acoustic-based power balladry with infectiously melodic solos, harmonic leads, and inviting clean vocals.But as good -- check that, great -- as all of these songs seem like mere lead-ins to the album closer, \"Illumination Theory.\" Why? Because it is an epically epic and several-parted (there are five subsets in all: \"Paradoxe De La Lumiere Noire,\" \"Live, Die, Kill,\" \"The Embracing Circle,\" \"The Pursuit Of Truth,\" and \"Surrender, Trust & Passion\") anthem that is experimental, complex, technical, creative, expansive, and innovative, even for Dream Theater! Sure thing, by clocking in at a relatively uncomfortable twenty-two-minutes and change, \"I.T.\" is almost worthy of a whole new review, just in and by itself. It begins on a heavy note, with a doomy main riff backed up by majestic-sounding keyboard flourishes and orchestral overtones, and from there it deftly and seamlessly transitions to an up-tempo groove laced with some Frank Zappa-inspired synth soloing. And following the great, bouncy, and almost John Bonham-worthy reverberating drum fill solo at around the 3.5 minute mark, it proceeds to adopt crunchy, chug and churn riffs.Around seven minutes in, the song adopts a chillingly ambient interlude where some creepy keyboard lines and sound effects loom overhead; and at about the nine minute mark, the song takes on a darkly symphonic vibe by marrying some violin accompaniment with Jordan Rudess' always excellent keyboard work. But after that, the number serves up a curveball in the form of a tricky tempo change which comes complete with funky, technical bass riffs and heavy, staccato guitar riffing. The vocals then make a triumphant re-entrance by soaring effortlessly over the top of the mix. And also included, here, are some exceptionally speedy, stomping, and precise drum fills, which lead the song to a climactic part where twin guitar harmonies and an unorthodox, technical, vertigo-inducing guitar-solo trade off/duel run rampant. (Here, the solos vary from melodically soaring and prog-ish to positively blistering.)As multi-faceted as the song may be, though, there are a few constants present in it, like phenomenal guitar craftsmanship, tricky time signatures, math-y arrangement change-ups, and infectious guitar/vocal melodies. \"Illumination Theory\" then seems to reach a seemingly perfect and climactic conclusion at around the nineteen-and-a-half-minute mark, but alas, this is not its end. It returns for one final exercise in prog-rock excess, with a gloomy piano line underscoring a simple, single-noted guitar melody and acoustic flourishes. It all makes for one really breathtaking soundscape that sounds not unlike something that Queen might have thought up, and an excellent conclusion to an astounding mammoth of a track.While this reviewer was still a little bit more taken with Dream Theater's 2009 opus, \"Black Clouds And Silver Linings,\" I have absolutely no reservations about saying that this is the sound of a band at the top of their game. In fact, to say that they are firing on all cylinders would be a gross understatement. And needless to say, this highly accomplished and adventurous affair rates as one of the year's best metal albums."
A1I586IWW7KLE4,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"This is the best album I have ever heard, hands down, everything else is secondary, and probably everything after Dream Theater by Dream Theater will be secondary.  This is it.  This is perfect.  This is the new standard.  This is better than any jazz I know of.  This is better than any classical music that I know of, including greats like Beethoven and Dvorak.  This album is eternal.  I can rest now in my search for great music because this one will probably hold my attention for years and years.I have been a music lover since I was a child.  I can still remember listening to Vivaldi on my Walkman at my now deceased grandmother&#8217;s house, which means my love of music goes back to the time when cassette tapes ruled the market and cds had not yet been invented.  I am now in my thirties, and I have been a fan of Dream Theater since I heard Pull Me Under on the Z Rock 50 on 94.1 WHJY, which was a hard rock top 50 countdown that prided itself by saying Casey Casum (or however you spell his last name &#8211; the guy who did the pop music countdown, which never seemed to give metal a chance) doesn&#8217;t have a clue.Well, now that I have heard Dream Theater by Dream Theater, I can die, and know that there is probably never going to be another album that is as good as this one, especially when it comes to complexity.  I&#8217;m a cerebral guy, and I don&#8217;t believe that it can get better than this.  This stuff blows away Aphex Twin, a computer musician programmer who actually tried to program good music.  Because I am a guitarist, programmed music will never touch me the way people do who are actually playing real instruments, even if effects are used.Reviewing this album, I am so happy to hear my son say one of the songs on this one is his favorite.  My boy already has good tastes, and without coaxing.  He knows what he likes, and Dream Theater is a part of that already.  He likes the song that sounds like Limelight by Rush, but is 10 times as good as it.I completely enjoy the seriousness of this album, as compared to A Dramatic Turn of Events.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, both albums are 5 star albums, but A Dramatic Turn of Events was super dorky with all its silly messiah talk."
A1F48KQEBOLPUW,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"After reading a number of these reviews, I decided to summarize them into one fill-in-the-blank review. This review works for any Dream Theater album.I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater. My favorite album is [album name]. This album is not as good as that album. The songs are too [heavy/light] and also too [long/short]. There's too much [instrument] and not enough [different instrument]. The band just hasn't been the same since [old band member] left. They were the heart of the band. Labrie sings [too soft, too screamy, too high, too low, too distorted, too clear] on this album. The recent album by [band no one has ever heard of] is way better that this album in every possible way. They should make more albums that sounds exactly like [album name] and just forget being creative."
A2VL8OTVS9IKX7,B00DJ80VLS,4.0,"The &#34;IT&#34; I like is Mangini's drum parts. There, that's &#34;IT&#34;, that's all I like about the recordingafter trying to listen to it hoping for more."
A3SAJFC65EGFZJ,B00DJ80VLS,4.0,"Why did I buy this album?  I was kind of getting burned out on Satriani, and I like to collect 5.1 versions (sorry I haven't had a chance to listen to much of the 5.1 mix, but I&#34;m sure it's great.) This had the 5.1 version on DVD. I hadn't bought a Dream Theater album since Falling into Infinity (I do have Liquid Tension experiment, and I saw them open for Yes in 2003 I think.).Am I  a huge Dream Theater fan?  I am a huge fan of the Images and Words album. I really cherish that album. I also really like Jordan Rudess, Liquid Tension experiment etc. Also I like Transatlantic, and Neal Morse which has Mike Portnoy involved. The rest of the albums I like about as much as this album, but this I think is better than Falling Into Infinity, maybe not as good as Change of Seasons. Obviously Dream Theater are like a mega super group, all extraordinary players. There's more to it than just good players, you have to relate to the music, and that's challenging.What do I think of the new drummer? Sounds like Mike Portnoy I guess.  Some spots have some incredible drumming, but I pay more attention to what the drummer does than how technically good the playing is. He does an excellent job.Would this be a good first Dream Theater album to get?  Not really. It is a sufficient sample of Dream Theater, but I would recommend Images and Words as a first CD, unless you want Jordan Rudess, then I'm not sure becuase I don't have all the albums. I think this is better than Falling into Infinity.What's the best thing about this album?  They do not fail to deliver what's good about Dream Theater. I'm glad that John Myung's bass playing is up in the mix in parts, and is kind of like Geddy Lee in places. Actually in a couple places it's reminiscent of Rush.I also like the sound quality of the album.What is the worst thing about this album? Except the last track, the singing is kind of predictable, and samey. It's difficult to hear the lyrics, or follow along in places.Would I buy another Dream Theater album?  Yes I'm thinking about buying the one before this album. When I'm in the mood to hear shredding, and metal, and kind of burned out on Satriani, DT makes a good change. I heard that the previous album was better. I'm not in a rush to get it. Dream Theater is great, but there's also lots of great stuff out there, that's a little easier on my ears like Jazz and stuff. At least DT is making it into my ecclectic mix."
A3B1WM9GDLHYVG,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"Dream Theater is my absolute favorite band. Admittedly, I don't think they could ever disappoint me, but this new offering is still an evolution of their previous work. It has all the hallmarks of a Dream Theater album, instrumental opening, heavy tracks with tons of solos, and an epic piece to tie it all together."
AW97ZK5FDSELS,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"DT aren't messing around anymore. It's like they made a concerted effort to emphasize each of their best qualities with this release. This album is dark, yet uplifting. Complex, yet accessible. Mind- blowingly powerful sometimes, hauntingly gentle at others.  It's even downright weird in places, but all in a good way. Even the production is wonderfully strange- kind of confusing in ways that make you want to listen harder. It's described as \"over-compressed\" by some, which is a criticism I don't agree with. I feel there was nothing accidental about the production of this record. If it sounds muddled at times, it only enhances the sort of dark mystery of the overall vibe, almost like the music swims out of the shadows right before punching you in the face (hence, the title of this review). I love it. The band is at new level now, the music seeming to transcend the players, if that makes any sense. Usually when I listen to my favorite bands -any bands, actually- I picture the players performing the music in my head, as I'm sure many people do. When I listen to this album, I still do that, but it's different. It's almost like the music somehow flows through the band as opposed to coming from it, and, sometimes, the players tend to disappear altogether, allowing the music to hover independently in front of you like images on a screen. I'm aware of how pretentious that may sound, but I'm just trying to describe my experience of listening to this record. There's a strange subconscious unfamiliar quality to this album, which I can't quite put my finger on, nor, however, do I want to. I'm not gonna say any more. If you're a Dream Theater fan, you must purchase Dream Theater now (though something tells me you already have ;))."
A3FW5VXKDXNWIW,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"When A Dramatic Turn of Events was released, I and many other people were pleasantly surprised at the well-executed trip back to their roots. Not knowing what to expect of this album, I was slightly skeptical after hearing the two singles, \"The Enemy Inside\" (Heavy, technical and fast paced) and \"Along for the Ride\" (Slow proggy ballad). But that skepticism quickly changed to joy the moment I popped the CD in my stereo and pressed play.The album opens with a short instrumental score that emits shades of Six Degrees. Brilliantly composed and a great way to start off such an epic album. (4/5)It then moves on to \"The Enemy Inside\" which is a song that most people would probably expect out of Dream Theater. It is clearly influenced by their own more modern style of progressive metal. (4/5)After \"The Enemy Inside\" comes \"The Looking Glass\". At first listen of that Rush-influenced, Images and Words style intro, I could not wipe the smile off my face.  This is also the first song where Myung's bass is very prevalent and noticeable. That is a quality that has been lacking in recent years for Dream Theater. (5/5)\"Enigma Machine\" is Dream Theater's first stand alone instrumental to appear on an LP in 10 years (Train of Thought). In between that span of time, they released a single titled \"Raw Dog\" for God of War 3. \"Enigma Machine\" starts off with a mellow intro but gives you the hint that something big is coming, and sure enough you get blasted with some Petrucci punches seconds later. This is not their best instrumental by any means but it fits the album well. What I enjoyed the most are the flashes of Erotomania. (5/5)The intro of \"The Bigger Picture\" makes it seem as if it is going to be a carbon copy of \"Outcry\" from A Dramatic Turn of Events, but that soon disappears as James LaBrie starts singing along with a beautiful Rudess piano piece. Afterwards one of the most catchy choruses of the album ensues. Although this is one of the more generic songs on the album, it surprises first listeners with quite the epic outro. (4/5)Behind the Veil is one of my personal favorites on the album. The intro sounds like something out of an epic video game or movie followed by one of the heaviest and richest Petrucci licks of Dream Theater history. LaBrie also outdoes himself in this particular piece, mixing vocal styles from many eras of the band. (5/5)\"Surrender to Reason\" is  the second song on the album that immediately gives you a Rush/Images and Word vibe. Throughout the song, there are prog licks galore accompanied by another brilliant LaBrie performance. My personal favorite part of the song is the absolutely monstrous and blistering instrumental section about 4 minutes in. A slick Myung bassline and a brilliant solo by Petrucci. I just wish it lasted longer. (5/5)\"Along for the Ride\" was the second single they released after \"The Enemy Inside\". It is a simple (by Dream Theater standards) prog ballad with flashes of good, but for the most part it is fairly generic. The lyrics are quite moving to anyone trying to relate though. (4/5)Finally, the song we have all been waiting for since it was announced. The next Dream Theater epic. \"Illumination Theory\" starts with an epic orchestral/rock theme that recurs later in the song through a full blown orchestral score. Soon followed by probably my new favorite Petrucci riff of all time. I just could not refrain from head banging at first listen. After the introduction to the themes (Paradoxe de la Lumiere Noire) of the song comes the first vocal section of the song (Live, Die, Kill). Afterwards comes the brilliant orchestral score  with REAL strings nonetheless. It is quite a moving piece. Soon afterwards comes my favorite part of the song and the album. When the orchestral score subsides, the listener gets surprised by some drum n' bass followed by some EXPLOSIVE James LaBrie vocals. He hits some notes I had no idea he was even capable of hitting anymore at this point in this career. Next comes the first full blown instrumental section of the song with flashes of ELP. Also one of the intro theme riffs is refrained at this point underneath Petrucci and Rudess solos. After the outro the song seems as if it may have ended prematurely to some listeners, but there is about 30 seconds of silence until we get the closure we need. An absolutely enlightening and beautiful piano and guitar score that fades out to end off the album. (6/5)Overall I personally thing this is Dream Theaters best work BY FAR since Scenes from a Memory. It has bits of inspiration from every Dream Theater era and even from some other bands. It is easily more innovative and original than anything they have done since Octavarium. I do not take sides in the Portnoy vs Mangini flame war, but this album absolutely proves that Dream Theater can move on just fine without Portnoy. The only \"bad\" thing about this album to me is the production and mix of Mangini's kit. His snare sounds horrendous at times. I guess that is one thing Portnoy probably does better than Mangini. Overall I easily score this album a 5 out of 5. Absolutely brilliant, and if you have not bought it or listened to it yet, I highly recommend it."
A2KDLKDX6J5HXL,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,Solid performances throughout this album. Very reminescent of Images and Words and Awake albums. This is the type of album that has made me a fan of Dream Theater for more than 20 years! Keep up the great work fellas!
AK0F8YQ7NSKR0,B00DJ80VLS,5.0,"Dashes out of the gate, finishes before you realize it, then leaves you wanting more.  If I were to complain about anything I'd say it's not a 2-disc album.  I just can't get enough Dream Theater."
AKXFPTH2TPFCK,B00DJAUP3U,5.0,"If your a Jonny Lang fan you will love this CD.  Saw him in concert a month ago and WOW, so glad I had already purchased his this CD, of course he was perfect in person but can't always have that so his CD's are excellent when you need just some soulful singing and blues."
A2E7FYIYM2EUJF,B00DJAUP3U,5.0,Jonny Lang is a very different performer and is a skilled guitarist. His songs on this album are so soulful and comprehensive. I recommend it highly. Get it if you like Jonny Lang!
A16BBXKAA2PN1W,B00DJAUP3U,5.0,"Most artists lose their luster after a few years, but Jonny Lang has managed to shine brighter than ever. With this album, Lang demonstrates his songwriting, rich vocals, guitar skills and musical arrangement. Each song is spectacular and unique. This album is a treasure for any music lover, and it certainly is a game-changer. From the opening note to the closing, it grabs the listener and leaves them in awe. Well done, Jonny, and welcome back!"
A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B00DJJAXN8,5.0,"This is not your typical &#34;Tribute Album,&#34; which makes it all the more interesting and enjoyable. As you can read elsewhere, or know already, Buddy Emmons was not only one of the greatest steel guitar players in the history of country music, but a true innovator (and inventor) who truly pioneered this special sound. This CD &#34;salute&#34; to him only includes 3 songs that he wrote, but the rest of the material on the album are either covers of songs that he originally played on, or feature steel guitar players who were influenced by his unique style. The result is a thrilling album of steel guitar bliss.Even though Emmons (who retired from playing in 2007) does not play on this album, the steel guitar playing throughout is totally first-rate. The last two tracks on the CD have especially impressive pedal steel performances; Gary Carter performing his own &#34;Shenandoah&#34;, and a cover of &#34;Mansion on the Hill&#34; with Dan Dugmore on pedal steel, Duane Eddy on guitar, and Spooner Oldham on piano. Too tasty for words! In addition to the stellar steel guitar sounds, there are some excellent vocal performances from the likes of Raul Malo, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, John Anderson, and Little Jimmy Dickens --- still belting 'em out in his 90s!The CD includes a very informative booklet that gives details about both the instrument and the career of Buddy Emmons. Fans of the instrument and quality country music, or anyone with &#34;Half a Mind&#34; should get this CD &#34;Someday Soon&#34;, It's guaranteed to give you &#34;Rainbows all over your Blues&#34; and then you won't &#34;Feel so Bad.&#34;"
A20RQB3SXOQCGF,B00DJSUNWA,5.0,"Other reviews link Chris Thile's performance of these works to those of Glenn Gould, and I concur. Gould brought enormous gravity to the lento/adagio movements of these compositions, and highway-dexterity and passion to the presto (&etc;) movements.One must ask where to place these sensitive performances in a playlist or rack. Thile, by offering exceptional an exceptional transcription and performance of these suites to an instrument one associates in America with the vernacular, suggests this wonderful artist and composer have together crossed a bridge. The sonorities of the mandolin do service to these wonderfully noble pieces scored for violin.There is continuity in music, and while the Beatles, with \"Eleanor Rigby,\" tried to cement this bridge between ages, Thile accomplishes more here with his attention to the manuscripts and their markings. The production, overseen by Edgar Meyer, is naturally-\"flat\" and exemplary. Such lovely stuff.The notes provide us with just enough backbone to inquire further into other daring performances in this genre.Beautifully done."
A4KQWXNLSJHCY,B00DJSUNWA,5.0,"Amazing musician meets amazing musician and the result is magical, inspiring, and almost leaves me breathless every time I listen to it. I could string more superlatives together but what's the point of that? If you like Bach and want to hear the music through a new set of ears and a new/old instrument, buy this, listen to it and applaud at the end even if you are the only one listening to it. Trust me, it will make you fell better."
A37ZIEUF0GQDYV,B00DJSUNWA,5.0,Flawless playing. Compares to Itzhak Perlman doing the same material on violin. I can't wait for volume 2. Hope Chris records other composers.
AVYO0TDE30RHH,B00DJSUNYS,5.0,Love myself some K Michelle and the voice speaks for itself! Go girl. I waited a while for the CD but I was not disapointed!
A1LJXCLSWS2IDB,B00DJSUNYS,5.0,K. Michelle you know i love ur music right?! Lol. well i do you did well on this cd. it came from the heart. and the one song you cant raise a man well.......us lady can relate for real. so you did this girl. love it!!!
AHSMPARTQOW3Y,B00DJSUNYS,4.0,"Personally, I  am not a K. Michelle fan, her presentation and delivery as a reality star is not very attractive.  But I took a chance and bit because her singing and ability to birth a song at a split second was interesting.  I have to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed this cd...although a few of the cuts are a bit much...but she is who she is.  I love 'My Life', 'Damn', 'Can't Raise A Man' and 'Sometimes' is my very favorite.  I love her voice, for some reason, while listening to it I felt like I was hearing a country singer.  On 'Sometimes' she made me think of Dolly Parton's 'Islands In The Streams'...great sound."
A1Q3ZJGN3FYKOV,B00DJYJQKO,5.0,Been a fan of DBT since they released &#34;A Southern Rock Opera&#34; and this raucous live set will in no way disappoint long time fans of this band.It is recorded LOUD and PROUD and in your face with great story telling by Patterson Hood and a band in full force.Drop the hammer and get outta the way.
A1J17SF23PA8CQ,B00DJYJQKO,3.0,"I really like DBT, and I really like live cds...but this one is not one of my favorites.  I've tried listening to it loud and with the volume turned down...neither works as an overall cd.  I like some of the individual songs on this one, but I'd rather listen to one of their other cds.  That's just how I see it."
A1GZI2R722NLXE,B00DJYJQKO,5.0,This is what a live CD should sound like.  It is exhilarating listening to live music and this one delivers.  Just listen to the guitar solo on track 2 once and you will be hooked.
AIOJXUQI0F2XQ,B00DJYJR26,5.0,If your a Waylon fan I think you will like this cd. I bought it for the Waylon songs but the other songs were pretty good to. It is worth listening to and the price was right.
A18S5NCHM6HH6L,B00DJYJRZS,5.0,"Thank you Capitol Records Nashville for finally releasing Glen Campbell's \"That Christmas Feeling\" on CD !!! This has always been one of my all-time favorite Christmas albums and it was really a disgrace that it was never available on compact disc until now (it had been previously released in Holland on the Disky label many years back but for only a short time and has been selling on eBay and Amazon for exhorbitant prices since...).This is a must buy - whether your a Glen Campbell fan or not ! Glen does a fantastic job on some Christmas standards and some new tracks that were written especially for this album !5 stars all the way !!!!"
AUNPM9TFKE1K2,B00DJYJTQA,5.0,"I'm sure it is a great cd.  I purchased it for a friend so I haven't heard it.  But, how can you go wrong with these two 'ole men'?"
A1303KD3DN2ULA,B00DJYJX2K,5.0,"Seriously, if you don't enjoy the music on this album, I have nothing for you. J Roddy Walston & the Business is THE BUSINESS! This album is pure rock. Having this album will impress girls, friends, other musicians and more. Those in the know, know how hard J Roddy works. They also know the effort and respect the work ethic. That is all aside from the awesome product. The music is what stands out on this album. If you're new to J Roddy or have heard of them and want a starting off point, you can't go wrong with this album. Great starting point for any new fan, a great addition to the collection of any old fan. Great work, awesome rock."
A32H9SADP6KQ9R,B00DJYJX2K,5.0,One of the best rock albums i'v heard in a while. Very catchy songs that are derivitave of led zep and '50's bop. Energy on this album makes you want to go see them live!! Coming to a town near you
A2P9S0Y2IKI6EK,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,I just got this CD recently and I am already friad tha I am going to wear it out from listening to it too much... Its the best !
A2TVXXFRXRWHCP,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,"I love this CD! Lots of good songs, but then what's not to like about Luke Bryan. He's just a great artist."
A9SFDPGM97XY5,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,I own all of Luke's other full length albums and enjoyed them all.  This one has impressed me from the 1st time I heard it.  Some of the others took awhile for me to appreciate them.  It is obvious to me that a lot of work went into making this a very likeable album with several potential singles.  Luke is getting better with each album he releases.
A3W4C6JFJ3ITCA,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,My wife got this from me for a Christmas gift. She's one heckuva country fan and loves this and the other cds I got her for Christmas
A1MHFO1841U6X7,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,Luke has put forth yet another fantastic album for all his fans! You will not be disappointed! Keep up the great work!
A3FDB5ZMVJYANF,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,This was a gift for my grandmother who she really likes. I listened to it and it's ok. I'm into the older country with Williams Sr. My grandmother loved it and that really all that matters.
A2Y7BR0YCA6Q0A,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,"This CD is jam-packed full of HITS!!I hope I don't wear it out, as it's played at least once a day . . . . most days multiple times!!"
A1RUU0TEW8JRDC,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,"what new  sound? this new CD is great follow up to \"tailgates and tanlines\"  say what you want but all that matters to meis LUKE BRYAN can sing! he has such a strong delivery in every song he sings. he sings with such a energy this guy sounds as clearas always. you can tell he really loves to sing. and did I say LUKE  BRYAN can sing! this is a great CD!"
A3FZHUBBGLNR8F,B00DJYK4VE,5.0,Luke Bryan has done it again with another classic cd.  He continues to get better with time.  I would have liked the extra tracks that Target has because I can't get enough.
A1Z8GATXYYF7T8,B00DJYK7PW,5.0,"Really great recording,. This is not straight ahead Jazz, but uses Jazz format and instrumentation. The tunes have multiple influences and there are tinges of folk, rock, ballads and blues in it.  All the musicians are absolute virtuosos, but virtuosity is not what the message is here.  It's very much a cohesive group effort.  After giving it a few listens, it is clear that there are unifying musical themes which tie the selections to each other.  Great grooves, melodies, and energy.  Buy it....you won't be dissapointed."
ALQ12GYW884EJ,B00DJYK7PW,5.0,"Is not exactly a Dave Holland record , is a CD of two young musicians; Craig Taborn, Eric Harland, and two masters; Kevin Eubanks and Dave Holland. Is a combination of sensations and feelings. Someone say is a \"fusion\" album ,  could be but I dint think so. For me  is electric jazz, that is different . Holland come back to Miles era, and the other ones create a world of feelings, music from different times and different generations, but great music. Three are from Eubanks, and two from Holland, Taborn and Harland. Is the perfect prism that make different colors in each composition. You must buy as soon as you can. Is more than a surprise is a miracle."
A1UY2FDZPGPV7L,B00DJYKF0O,4.0,"While I don't think it's as good as Sound Awake or Themata, I do like this album. I particularly like the songs, Aeons, Aidolon, Alpha Omega, and We Are. I definitely like it more than the last Birds of Tokyo album.(different band, same vocalist)"
AEZJ4AM4SVD9C,B00DJYKFXG,5.0,"The surround sound disc (disc 5) is the reason I bought it.  I would've preferred blu-ray, but the DVD sound coupled with the great job of remixing and remastering makes for an excellent sounding disc.  You buy this this for the sound, not the videos.  They are great, but there's only a couple.  Considering that the videos were not intended to be released to the public, they are more for Band devotees and are not up to the caliber of today's typical music videos.  Discs 1 & 2 (the remastered, remixed Stereo album) are pristine.  The soundboard mixes (discs 3 & 4) are great, in that you get the entire New Year's Eve concert (with Bob Dylan) from beginning to end.  In my opinion, the remixing and remastering brings out the individual instruments (especially the organ) in a way never heard on any version of Rock Of Ages."
A28TLPQVSAXCLR,B00DJYKFXG,5.0,"I actually bought this set..the sound will pin you back in your seat,...These guys and this set is way above any music made today.....the drums sound full and deep-and Garth..amazing.Danko..have mercy..when i grow up i want to be Levon...I know this is not a cheap set to buy...however....forgo your Miley Cyrus and get this..I knew it was coming and saved up...I have been driving around blastin this out of my truck and it sounds spectacular,as if you were there...no lie......And after playing a few more gigs-and had time....I now went  to disc 4 the DVD and what do ya know..there is video...yep..do not believe rumors that there is still pictures ...O yea!!! It's video and it's great...2 songs..THANKS!!"
A1MH1BMEIFS6SP,B00DJYKFXG,5.0,The New Years Eve sound board mix is worth the price alone.  Add the 5.1 surround disk and the remaster of the original and the book that it comes in and you have a great package.I have always preferred this show to &#34;Last Waltz&#34; because of the horns in second set
A2LWEV75PQFK6C,B00DJYKFXG,3.0,"First things first.  The music is incredible.  Truly one of the best live recordings out there and a long time favorite.  The New Years Eve discs are outstanding with a very cool sound.  Haven't gotten to the DVD yet (never been a big fan of audio DVD as my stereo is nowhere near my television)  Now the gripe.  What is it with the Band and books accompanying their CD's?  I know Robbie Robertson holds himself and the legacy of the band in very high regard but this is too much.  The book and extravagant packaging (1 disc each on a 12x12 space... really?) only serve to jack up the price and get away from the original point- THE MUSIC!  So... I will watch/listen (hell, I don't know what) to the DVD once, flip through the book maybe twice and listen to the music a bunch.  Five Stars for the music... One Star for the pompous delivery."
A288VPD5GRZKOT,B00DKY4LBW,5.0,"Believe the hype. AM is a heady mix of swaggering beats, slinky riffs, and sophisticated out-on-the-tiles lyrics. Flashing hints of 1990's Dr. Dre, Paranoid-era Black Sabbath, and early 1980s Hall & Oates, AM is an amalgam of musical awesomeness. Most of the tunes have a not-too-sweet pop catchiness to them, without sacrificing any of the indie-cred creativity and cleverness that the Arctic Monkeys are rightfully known for. This is a much more varied and listenable album than the last two Josh Homme-produced efforts (both of which underwhelmed me). I've been listening to AM on repeat for the last week, to the exclusion of everything else, and it's still not old (I must have listened to R U Mine at least a hundred times, while trying to learn the drum parts; it still rocks harder than anything they've done since their debut). I can't remember the last time that I've been this into an album. Every night a different AM song is stuck in my head and when I wake in the morning another has taken its place. It's quite simply my favorite album of 2013 (so far)."
AQ4QA27NIP2JB,B00DKY4LBW,5.0,excellent
A3N0RO529FPKT0,B00DKY4LBW,5.0,"This album is excellent from start to finish.  If there are fillers on here, which I say &#34;no&#34;, you just have to listen to understand what I say."
AVYHWCIW5LNAX,B00DLC0KR2,5.0,"This new CD has very entertaining melodical pop music from prolific singer-songwriter Sam Phillips. It's her 10th studio album titled 'Push Any Button' (10 brand new tracks). Indeed Sam Phillips has 10 great new tunes, press on any tune you'll hear quite melodical enjoyable pop music.The track \"Speaking Of Pictures\" has a guitar sound reminiscent of the Eagles' \"Hotel California\" in some parts. Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \"All Over Me\" (melodical indie-pop-rock sound), \"When I'm Alone\" (wonderful melody and vocals), \"See You In Dreams\" (great violin playing and melody), \"Going\" (beautiful orchestral base track, vocals and melody) and the sweet closing track \"Can't See Straight\".Good tracks are \"Speaking Of Pictures\", \"You Know I Won't\" and \"No Time Like Now\" (great guitar chhords). Okay tracks are opening track \"Pretty Time Bomb\" (indie-pop-rock sound) & \"Things I Shouldn't Have Told You\".On overall, prolific singer-songwriter Sam Phillips is on the roll in this new melodical pop album \"Push Any Button\". A highly recommended CD listening."
A1HUN5L5NP6XI4,B00DLKXF3A,2.0,"Not really much to it, this album was bland, I couldn't listen to it more than twice before I put this cd away."
ADFLU0LIU44CM,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,"Avenged sevenfold was always a band to me i didnt dislike but at the same time never put them up to a standard of genious mucisians. But this new direction they have taken with hail to the king is something worth looking at, when heard the first single \"hail to the king\" i could immediatley hear the change in style, they made the music more about riffs and slowing down to show their true talent as mucisians. The band really took on a late 80s metallica and megadeth sound. The song planets really shined on this record for me, over all i give this album 4.4 stars. I hope this isnt a one time deal because this album is great."
AIDFLFUKJ657I,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,this is an exxcellent release a few subtle differences. good to have another metal release out right now no need for other reviewers to rate so low they are just losers anyway.
A2NEMGBFLAFR7I,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,I loved every song on this album and I have listened to it over and over and I do not get tired of this new Avenged Sevenfold contribution. I advise everyone that loves metal to purchase this album. I think anyone that purchases this album will love it. It is typical Avenged Sevenfold music and you will not be disappointed with this purchase. Enjoy!
A32H7210WMUXDC,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,"i knew going into this album, i would NOT be disappointed. and i was more than blown away by this album. (again, its a habit saying \"album\"). i have every edition. from the \"Hail To The King Limited Treasure Chest\" to the \"Deluxe\" and the \"Original\". why? because i could and i wanted to see all of the extras and hear the \"Lighter\" song (St. James) to the tribute of Jimmy \"The Rev\" Sullivan who also called himself \"Fiction\". look, they have grown up with every album from \"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\" to this more than beautifully rock filled jam. there is NOT bad song on this album. and who cares about the hair that M. Shadows grew out???!!! i remember when i told (still to me) an awesome friend \"watch, after \"Nightmare\", M. Shadows will grow out his hair\" and he did! HAIR has NOTHING to do with MUSIC. but, if you pay attention, his hair was always different. from shaved to the skin to short hair, from the beginning - he had purple bangs. anyways, this album showcases maturity, growth, but yet still has that Rock N Roll and head banging sides. but still, i can clench my fists to some tunes - \"Shepherd of Fire\", \"Planets\" \"Doing Time\" and sit back, relax and say \"wow, how beautiful that song is\" - \"Crimson Day and even parts of \"Heretic\". i cant wait till Oct. 19 here in Dallas, Texas!!! people have asked me - \"what is your favorite song, album, etc from Avenged Sevenfold?\" my answer? \"all of them\". they all (songs) - \"each one holds a part of my heart\". am i obsessive about A7X??? NO. again, NO. they are just one of the FEW bands that touches my heart. not only that, THEY hold and treat their fans like they are a part of their family. in my opinion Arin Ilejay has earned his stripes and of course i didnt get all worried. the band wouldnt have hired him, if he couldnt keep up and didnt have a particular attitude. im curious what Beast & The Harlot, Seize The Day (which saved my life) and other classics will sound like when Arin hits the sticks. BUT, if all they play is the singles and just the album is fine with me. the change already happened and honestly, in my opinion, from the singles with Arin to a whole album, you can tell he is one killer drummer. he has even went on record and said, \" i dont want to replace The Rev or try to sound like him\", that took guts and earned another stripe of welcoming him to the A7X family."
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,"I'm rating this album 5 stars even though it's not the \"best\" work from A7X simply because it's a very solid album from front to back, and probably deeper than \"Nightmare\", despite the title track of the latter and some good singles.  I don't think it makes any sense to hate A7X for being one of the few \"metal\" acts that can sell albums, or arguing over whether they're metal or not.  Ironically, you hear BLATANT callbacks to Metallica (\"Sad But True\") and GNR on this record, and those were two groups that people often criticized at the time for not being \"metal enough\".  At the end of the day, buzz words and genres don't matter if you're just a great band.  This is a dark period in time for guitar music in general, and A7X is still one of the better guitar bands out there, IMO."
AAH3KOCYCBIQI,B00DLKXF3A,5.0,"A7X another great album. maybe not as great as Nightmare but few albums are. The songs flow well together and show how the guys have went back to their roots their influences. Its still unmistakable A7X album. It really showcases all of their talents. Nightmare show cased the Rev. and Hail to the King showcases the excellent guitar solos, vocals. The only thing I dislike is what its really missing is a longer set list."
A3F7RDVB69RFIA,B00DLSA4B8,4.0,"It may not be my favorite and it does sound a bit like the last two, but it covers enough new ground and has enough highlights to rate very high with me.  I love the lack of vocals and the high energy.  The musicianship is outstanding and the tunes memorable. Thanks again for a great trip! Maybe next time a bit more jazzy???Update: I've now listened to the disk every day since I purchased it and it gets better each time! Outstanding energy and creativity. Thanks!Update 2 - six months later:  I am more impressed with this CD today than the day I bought it!  I listen to it often and it just keeps getting better.  It is definitely now my favorite Lorber CD of all time!  Keep it up!"
A1NX8E04PZG7TO,B00DMEQOXS,4.0,Ok first of all his voice is NOT as bad as people are saying.  In spots it does sound weak but he is also singing some of the verses in a lower register.  The songs are hit and miss here...Most of them are good but few are great.  I really enjoyed the song I'm No Russain.  In my opinion the worst song on here is Too Drunk To Karaoke.  The lyrics are so simple a 12 year old or Justin Bieber could have come up with them...All in all if you like Jimmy Buffett get this CD...if at first listen you are disappointed then listen to something else and then give it another chance.  It will grow on you.
A1D01SYHNZPKLY,B00DMEQOXS,4.0,"VERY MELLOW BUFFETT CD, HIS FIRST IN A LONG TIME. IT SHOWS A MATURITY THAT IS NOT TYPICAL BUFFETT BUT IS A GREAT NEW EFFORT. WORTH THE"
A344M4952B9D8Y,B00DMEQOXS,5.0,A little of everythign here - the oldie goldies and a couple I don't rememeber. But all good!  Love this!
A3JRNTDMAL29IM,B00DMEQOXS,4.0,"Perhaps a good Phd thesis would be to break music down to math to determine why it seems so predictable. The candidate would listen to everything an artist had ever done then generate a algebraic equation for the half dozen or so genre's he has so that we could continue to produce the same kind of music after he retires.The subject is Jimmy Buffett.1. Clever Lyrics. Clearly \"Earls Dead- Cadillac For Sale\" fits into this category. Man + Woman + Car of some kind = Fun story.2. Cursing Mortality. Ok, another tired song about a tired surfer, \"Oldest Surfer on the Beach\". (Old Beach Guy + Board) X Beaches with Waves = Sad Tale.3. Paired up with a younger country western singer to inject some testosterone into the album. \"Too Drunk to Karaoke\". Young Buck + Buffett + a first line that reads \"I was at the bar\" minus any originality multiplied by the square root of the number of country western radio stations in America divided by the sum of millions of pickup trucks and cowboy hats = steady income for JB.4. Filler tune; Nothing really special but needed the track. \"I'm no Russian\". Music + some lyrics less anything interesting to say = something completely forgettable.5. Songs that will stand the test of time. \"Tides\" and \"Soulfully yours\". Actual thought + carefully crafted music probably by someone else named Mac + Nadirah Shakoor = a timeless classic which is why we keep buying these albums, for the gems each one has to have.And that Ladies and Gentleman is the Jimmy Buffet Theorem.You betcha."
A5C5K1K732P89,B00DMEQOXS,5.0,"Parrotheads will easily be able to sing along, (karaoke or not) after a few listens, which is a big part of Buffet fun.  A party driving CD for commuters and definitely the next BBQ.  I love living in the mountains, but this has me feel the need for some beach time!"
A1PJK5EGYP15OW,B00DMEQP2S,5.0,"If you only like MGMT for their early pop singles 'Time to Pretend', 'Kids', and 'Electric Feel', then OF COURSE you aren't going to enjoy this album. MGMT are just as gloriously as all-over-the-place as always, but with even better production this time around. I really loved the visualizer thing they did with this album pre-release, but hearing it on CD quality is a real treat. One of my favorite bands right now. Can't wait to see how they subvert expectations even MORE in the future."
A32VTLSAIW1K5H,B00DMR0AMQ,5.0,"If you have not heard them sing, you are missing out. I saw them on an email and tried to find if they had an album. They did but only in Britain, until Amazon told me it was available. A good mix of modern and classical music."
A2D1UD6WYNRU55,B00DMRNMRQ,1.0,Jay-Z needs to stop making music because this album was terrible and should not even be considered music. Jay-z please stay retired and just keep counting your money.
A2DG2OI09EJXQ0,B00DMRNMRQ,4.0,"First, my perspective: I'm one of the Hip Hop fans that Nas describes as, \"Trapped in the 90's\". I was breastfed on Run-DMC, Slick Rick and EPMD and Tribe and Wu-Tang were the soundtrack to my adolescence.  To me, Jay-Z is one of the few remaining touchstones of that East Coast, lyric heavy culture.  Needless to say, I think that most of what we call rap these days flat out sucks. Lil Wayne can bite it, if you ask me.Magna Carter Holy Grail is a solid but not spectacular entry into Jay-Z's awesome and unprecedented discography. He has assembled most of the heavyweight producers of today, with the notable exception of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Kanye West, and they have put together some of the dopest, multilayered beats you wil find this year. Perfect to play in the gym, on your headphones, in the car or crazy in the club.  The lyrics, on the other hand, are a mixed bag.Jay-Z has what you can describe as \"first world problems\"....dude is rich as hell, popular, connected and he's married to freakin' Beyonce.  He can no longer rap about the streets or the drug game with any authenticity. Some people expect him to spit fiery, aggressive lyrics like independent rappers Killer Mike or Joey Bada$$; about what?, the long valet line at the Met? We'd crucify him if he tried.  So he raps about what he knows, his life, his businesses, his success and yes, his possessions.  Most of the time he does it well, other times he does it offbeat.  I haven't quite decided if this is done on purpose to imitate the current southern \"trap\" sound or if the beats are just too complicated and busy to match his flow.  Either way, the result is music that sounds good, but in no way will make you forget about Reasonable Doubt or Vol. 2.Standout songs include \"Heaven\", \"Part II\", \"Holy Grail\" and my favorite track, \"Somewhereinamerica\" with the infamous Miley Cyrus reference. Curiously, he put two one minute songs on here that, had they been full songs, could have been the best on the whole album.Other reviewers will give you a better track by track listing, but from my perspective, this album is the most consistent and productive Jay-Z has been in his \"post retirement\" phase."
A1IV3HY9SISZ1K,B00DMRNMRQ,5.0,"I love this CD...well love might be a bit strong but I really , really like it.  I don't see a lot of middle ground with this CD particularly when people speak about it.  This is the only cd i played for 4 days when i purchased and I enjoyed it from front to back. I was also trying to listen to it to understand why so many people didnt like it.  In fact friends of mine thought I was trying to either torture them or force them to like it because I played it so much.  This cd is not for everyone but then again I know people that don't like Michael Jackson (rip) or Prince or Jame Brown for that matter and their are all GREATS."
A1WFJ04YJEJVA7,B00DMRNMRQ,4.0,"I haven't exactly been a fan of Jay-Z's rapping, I'm still not exactly a fan, but hearing the entire album for a change made me think that Jay-Z has what it takes to bring a new style of rap. While I believe that the overproduced songs and barrage of collaborations take kind of shows a lack of lyrical content from Jay-Z, the songs are very catchy."
A2ECSD673EMYVB,B00DMWJDCE,5.0,I played this in the car as soon as I received it.  The two new previously unreleased songs were fantastic and the recording quality of the rest of some very familiar tunes will make this CD one I will play for quite awhile.
A10R1M4ALPQ9H0,B00DN713KI,5.0,"Everyone needs to hurry and get this CD. The reason is because of three important factors: Tyrese, Ginuwine, and Tank. These men have been tearing it down for years, and now they have merged together to bring R&B; back. They give you lessons in love that you and I need, so the next time around, OMG, we will keep running back to TGT so they can explode in our hearts and on the charts. I know this CD will be in all of our house(s) because it is one of the best R&B; CDs in a long time. There are a some great slow jams and ballads, but don't take it wrong, these songs will make you tell your weekend love that the sex has never felt better until the both of you burn out because there is no fun if the one you love doesn't FYH. Thanks TGT for this highly anticipated CD.(I tried to give you a summary using the song titles, which I hope you enjoyed)"
A38SB1C1FVVC2P,B00DN713KI,5.0,"WOW!!!  These three sexy men together are excellent.  There voice are strong, yet unique their own way.  All three together in harmony is simply beautiful.  The creativity of the sounds, beats, and lyrics allows one to see what they were aiming for.  I love all three, but Tank is my favorite."
AVYO0TDE30RHH,B00DN713KI,2.0,"I love TGT, but I dont love them clean! I wanted the explicit version and I bought the clean version and then found out that there was an explicit version I felt like I was cheated. I am not into clean music unless that is the only version. If I have the explicit version, they would definately get a five star review."
AMFSCCYV4BM8O,B00DN713KI,4.0,This CD stands up to its name. I  love the music from all three of these singers. They really make you feel good with their voices. Great CD!!!!!
AD3C29MKDX7V2,B00DN713KI,4.0,I like this cd. This is a nice cd by Tyrese  Ginuwine and Tank I would buy this cd they are three talented singers.
A2WLT2JC9DALRK,B00DN713KI,2.0,"Only 3 songs were really good. However, didn't expect to hear vulgar language. So a 2 star rating is all I can give and that's just for those 3 songs I like. For their 1st album together I would have thought it would be more tasteful for all concern. Not all their listeners/fans are teenagers and/or under 30!"
A4AMELBZP8KGA,B00DNDR29I,5.0,"I have been straight fiend for this album since I heard that it was being recorded earlier this year.  A little underwhelmed by the first single, &#34;Q.U.E.E.N.&#34;, mostly because I could see that it tied into the larger picture of the parent album, so I decided not to judge it too harshly, especially once &#34;Dance Apocalyptic&#34; surfaced, video and all, wowing all my ladyparts!The album itself, on the whole, is the best thing she's done since Metropolis Suite I : The Chase, in that it works from beginning to end, makes you want more.I adore The ArchAndroid, and on a song-to-song level, it may be the stronger collection, but all that Janelle has wanted for Cindy Mayweather feels twenty times more believable this time around, not to mention that this is THE most reigned-in her collaborators have ever appeared in cameo form.  Not just the Prince moments, though that sets the standard: song first, guest star second.  I love it.  By the time Queen Esperanza Spalding appears for &#34;Dorothy Dandridge Eyes&#34;, I feel like I've been wooed by the best in the business without even knowing they were there.Props to the Wondaland Orchestra for being all they can be and more - the performances are earthier this time, and even when the influences are obvious (sometimes Outkast, sometimes Stevie Wonder, sometimes both at once), the band sounds like they are the first to discover the notes they're using.I'm already putting this in my top three albums for 2013.  Maybe at the very top.  Maybe.  It's been such an excellent year for music, it's really hard to say.This should be required listening for all composers and all outsiders!Runteldat!"
AGLLS01FC513I,B00DNDR29I,5.0,"Anyone with an ear for real, superior musicianship, needs to hear JM! Prince led me 2 her, and ive been on board since her 1st cd! Brilliant artist!"
A1T0LSFNXPLOBF,B00DNDR29I,2.0,"I bought her last one the archandroid  I thought it was dope. Im always on guard for  artist that &#34;go left&#34; I feel like thats a excuse because if they did mainstream stuff they would be exposed for how wack they really are but with Janelle its different. I think she got a lot of talent I think this album has too many features and I dont know, shes got a lot popular so maybe she felt like dialing it in..it just doesnt resonate with me.."
A3HIEOLVIA1KWQ,B00DNDR29I,5.0,"Some songs off the album were decent, but Ghetto Woman along with few others like It's Code, another song produce with Prince are a keeper."
A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B00DNDR29I,4.0,"When Janelle Monae first hit my radar. I was immediately intrigued. Watching her growth over the last couple of years, especially her true-the-core tribute to The Jackson Five \"I Want You Back\" on award shows, I never fully drowned myself in her debut because there were a lot of tracks and it was the kind of album that demanded numerous listenings from start to finish. It is a perfect example of why allowing less disciplined fans pick and chose their favorite songs to download isn't always ideal. Some albums were created as a complete vision.\"Electric Lady\" with its nearly 20 songs is again a thoroughly creative endeavor. It has interludes that intertwine between songs that while not essential, I figure over time to experience \"Electric Lady\", it will come with new awakenings. Again there are several different styles and genres of music. Immediately, the neo-soul mid tempo pseudo ballads strike a chord. \"Can't Live Without Your Love\", Dorothy Dandridge\" and \"What an Experience\", all near the end of the album, are quite beautiful. The first single, \"Q.U.E.E.N\" and \"Ghetto Woman\" create a different feel.While \"The Arch Android Experience\" didn't exactly set sales records, its wonderful to see how \"Electric Lady\" shows tremendous growth in several different international territories. La Monae seems to have cleverly avoided any sophomore jinx some three years after she first hit the scene. I and probably many more of her core fans are rooting for a Gold or even Platinum album. The lady creatively deserves it. Like Annie Lennox's \"Diva\", \"Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band\" and/or albums like Grace Jones' \"Warm Leatherette\", the concept album is in fine health."
A3P6KETAGL1LAF,B00DNDR29I,5.0,I like listening to this a lot and I'm glad it doesn't disappoint at all. I'm still in love with archandroid :)
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00DNDR29I,2.0,"straight up she needs a Bruno Mars to write and produce a good half of a record for her to give her that foot in the door hit. she has everything going for her, however she lacks that personality that works on record for me.  and this album at times feels like a 80's  throwback attempt to some of the stuff Prince use to do and he is featured on the album and well unless you are getting him at his 80's peak and prime well its sounding  dated and played out in 2013.  to me she has broadway musical artist written all over her a modern day Vanessa L.Williams thing where you make albums as a hobby or for fun. her and Badu do  a broke Klymaxx Meeting in the Ladies room on their duet which never heats up.  the Broke Nona Hendrix  attempt just feels contrived and needs an overhaul.she has something their, however she ain't got the right person writing and producing it it. she is very polished and alot of showmanship, however the bottom line is  MIA.if she ever finds that money track and who she is as a artist, then she will look back and hear the difference, if not being a lounge act at the holiday inn at 3 in the morning or the next big musical is always an option."
A3PBGXJY1T1GPU,B00DNDR29I,5.0,"What an experience as Ms. Janelle says. This album is great. When I first bought this album yesterday I was like &#34;19 tracks is a lot and I'll be skipping some tracks for sure&#34; But that wasn't the case. I am actually pressing repeat! I listened to the album about three times straight through already. It's great. &#34;Victory&#34; deserves a Grammy nod for Record of the Year. Seriously I got emotional listening to it the first and second time. A great chapter of her planned saga of the for the ArchAndroid, Ms. Cindi Mayweather. This is truly an album with a concept and point of view. Every song fits, no song feels out of place, the interludes really keep everything glued together too. Also she is a pretty good rapper, so glad no guest rappers on her tracks. Love &#34;Victory&#34; lovely beat and great message-finding glory in the little things, &#34;Electric Lady&#34; song with a purpose, perfectly praising confident women everywhere, &#34;Primetime&#34; a love ballad that does not degrade nor disgust me, Q.U.E.E.N&#34; one of the most insightful raps I've heard in a long time-&#34;While you selling dope, we going to keep selling HOPE&#34;-beautiful.I love how the guests artists don't overpower the song. Its so annoying when you're jamming to a beautiful song and all of a sudden 2 Chainz or some other equally annoying rapper pops in jacks up the song, sorry Ms. Chrissette. Well that isn't the case here. All the cameos, Prince, Erkyah Badu, Solange, Miguel, and Esperanza are more of a collaboration instead of an apparent scramble for an artist to fill a gap. Ms. Monae seemed to have put thought into selecting the featured artists and how the final product would compliment her work. Overall this album is lovely and will remain in my rotation for a long time. Hopefully I can see her perform next time she heads to Minneapolis."
AGLHCU1KX96DZ,B00DNVJ0IQ,5.0,"While the Dvorak Violin Concerto hasn&#8217;t quite the soaring lines, memorable melodies, and grand Romantic gestures we find in some of the other popular violin concertos, it offers its fair share of pleasures. Certainly this recording from violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Berlin Philharmonic makes the most of them.Dvorak begins the concerto with an Allegro ma non troppo (fast, but not too much), the &#34;ma non troppo&#34; marking used in all three movements. The violin enters almost immediately, and Ms. Mutter caresses the opening passages most tenderly, while still imparting a desired grandeur to the music. Joachim may have felt that the orchestra dominated the score, but Dvorak made some revisions before premiering it, and certainly in this interpretation, Maestro Honeck and his Berlin players share the spotlight equally with the violinist, never overwhelming her. If anything, it is Ms. Mutter's commanding execution of the music that tends to control the reading. The performance is tender, lilting, singing, rhapsodic, and a touch melancholic in every phrase.The slow central movement, the Adagio ma non troppo, is the emotional heart of the work. Again, Dvorak's marking indicates he didn't want the soloist or orchestra to take things too slowly, possibly not to make the music too sentimental. Nevertheless, while Ms. Mutter does tend to stretch it out a bit more than usual, she never loses sight of the music's emotional grip. Even at a marginally slower pace than some other violinists have approached it, she is well able to communicate the movement's pensive yearning.In the Finale Dvorak returns to the radiant, dance-like tunes of the opening movement, and Ms. Mutter shines accordingly. She has a good feel for Dvorak's Bohemian roots, and her violin skips along merrily. It's a delight, and along with Perlman (EMI) we must now count it among the best recorded performances of the work available.Coupled to the concerto are the Romance for Violin and Orchestra in F minor, Op. 11 and the Mazurek for Violin and Orchestra in E-minor, Op. 49. The former is a tuneful cantabile, the latter a more carefree folk dance. In both instances, the soloist and orchestra are at one and execute the music with precision and joy.The combination of one of the world's leading violinists with one of the world's greatest orchestras results in a world-class set of performances that one can hardly fault. Both Ms. Mutter and the Berlin Philharmonic play gloriously.The Berlin Philharmonic is a magnificent ensemble, but too often producers have felt it necessary to record them live, with all the consequent shortcomings that technique implies. Here, we get a big, full, warm sound, slightly close up but not overbearingly so. With an enormous dynamic range, a strong impact, and a wide frequency response, the resultant sound is very impressive, rather like being in the sixth or seventh row of the concert hall itself.John J.

A23M2D8GZPCWCV,B00DOPXC94,5.0,"I first heard of BOO when I saw them on the roster for a Periphery tour.  I wanted to familiarize myself with their music before the concert, so I bought this album and Discovery (I'm obviously a late comer to the band).  I was blown away!  Here's my track by track analysis:Trk 1 - Machine: A fantastic intro to the album, reminiscent of Symphony X's intros.  Features symphonic keyboarding, a dark choir sound, pretty sick lead guitar parts in harmony.  It makes you expect great things.  My only complaint about this track was they didn't take it anywhere and just repeated the motifs.Trk 2 - Divergency: Starts with one of their more memorable riffs on the album. This has has some more distinct guitar riffs than most of the album, as they are usually just chugging along. The outro on the song is my favorite on the album.Trk 3 - Mindful:  Very cool keyboard mix. This is also the first song where they show you their mastery of breakdowns. The layering at 2:38 is absolutely incredible. There are only a couple other layering moments like this on the album.Trk 4 - Exhilerate: I enjoyed the bass glissando's, and the somewhat more pop rock sound at the beginning. This track has the closest thing you'll get to melodic singing on the album.  Really appreciated the short guitar solo and the bone crushing riffage that serves as the outro, another favorite moment on the album.Trk 5 - Absolution: who would've thought you could make symphonic death metal sound pretty? The intro for this song as well as the outro are some of the most beautiful metal music I've ever heard. Excellent use of harmonics throughout as well.Trk 6 - The Origin: excellent multilayered synth intro. I'm not sure how you characterize what happens at 2:26, it's somewhat akin to a slower breakdown, and is a super cool groove with synth soaring overhead in the treble range that makes it like a metal video game.Trk 7 - Aeon III: this song opens up with an amazing middle eastern sounding synth track, and an underlying breakdown type groove that thrusts you right into the song headlong, and if played at a concert moshing would most certainly ensue. 2:41 has some of the ballsiest riffage ever.Trk 8 - Imaginary Condition: at 0:21 has a delightful tragic/epic string part over top of the nice crunchy riffage. 1:21 starts a sort of thrash metal blast beat, which descends into the most layered, intense, poop-your-pants breakdown I feel that I've ever heard in music. I want to see this breakdown in concert at some point in my life, or I will die incomplete. The part from 2:28 to the end again makes me feel like BOO needs to write the soundtrack for an RPG.  It's like Nubuo Uematsu meets metal (which I guess he already did).Trk 9 - Illusionist: this song features a lot of guitar unison's, as well as even a bit of counterpoint at one point between the guitar and the keyboards.Trk 10 - Source Field: this song doesn't waste time with an intro, but jumps right into the gut busting riffage. They also do that that choppy blast beat thing before the break down, like they've done a couple other times on the album already.Trk 11 - Vengeance: great symphonic intro with quick fingered arpeggios on the guitar. Very nice and quick blast-beat thing after that. I do enjoy how they expound upon the arpeggiated guitar part later, as well as the symphonic intro. They even had a strange little electronic drum beat in the outro.Overall, I felt this album is a 5/5 star for what it is. They do what they do rather well. It's not at raw as Discovery, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole album.  I would've like a little more variety on the album, as the whole album basically has the same tempo.  I'm hoping they continue to grow musically and explore what they can do.  I'll lose interest if their next album sounds exactly like this one, but what they did here was golden."
AA8SGVTLXEBQ2,B00DOPXCAS,5.0,"Just awesome... this band has continued to evolve and change their music, while yet retaining their originality.  This album is different than before, but in a very good way.  Even more technical than before, but with more refined vocals and a boosted intensity that would get anyone out of their seat and jumping.  Great buy for those who enjoy technical, heavy, melodic and just awesome music!!"
A3PHGRWNSU3NBC,B00DOQK29G,5.0,"I love listening to Sammy Hagar, this cd is fun and different than what Sammy would normally do.  It's a must have CD!"
A768OB1LNE356,B00DOQK29G,3.0,I expected far more from Sam.  This is a lazy effort.  Very little for music here which has moved me and I'm a long time Sam fan.  I've moved away from buying everything he puts out as over the years things have degraded.  This is a perfect example.  Oh and the package ? they seem to have spent most of their time figuring out how to reuse signatures over and over all over this CD.  Totally disappointed.  Highlights for me are Ronnie Dunn and Nancy Wilson tunes.  Everybody is doing the duet album thing at this point and Sam is on board.
A1Z3J47CVJCUT8,B00DOQK29G,5.0,"ONE OF SAMMY,S BEST. LOVE THE DUETS. GOOD TRAVELLING SONGS. WOULD RECOMMEND OT TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES SAMMY,S MUSIC. GREAT"
A1V4MXF1SLG0U6,B00DOQK2AK,5.0,"When she left Nightwish I knew she would go for bigger and more dramatic songs and sound.Since she has not played live anywhere near me, this was a great 2nd."
ABQ5LKPOUYBKR,B00DOQK2AK,5.0,"Thank you Amazon for the box set. The vinyl size booklet is just a blow-up of the same cd booklet from any digipak. The posters? Well, can live with or without them. The T-shirt is good. L fits me but are we not supposed to hang it on the wall just like the posters? The box itself is beautiful. Now the cd. This digipak is well made with a bit of thought put into it. Now, the music is incredible. I luv Tarja's singing. Every new Tarja cds get better than the previous ones.This is what excites!! ...and thank you Tarja for the music."
A7AWAIVOA1IVR,B00DOQK2OG,5.0,Rainbow is in full form during this live recording.  Love the song selection as well as the power of the music.  Been a Rainbow fan for years.  Love this album as it rocks!!!
AI1HCK9KJ5QX7,B00DOQK2V4,4.0,"It's not a surprise that this composer does movie trailers for a living. The Elysium soundtrack is loud and bombastic synth and orchestra music, full of big emotions. Like the film, it is by no means subtle. The 29 tracks seem to breeze by despite being over an hour and ten minutes; it's a high energy piece. I'm hard pressed to say that there's one memorable moment or even a recognizable melody, but it's very good for what it is: epic action music."
A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00DOQK2V4,3.0,"Elysium is a bit of a Cinderella story for composer Ryan Amon who has scored absolutely nothing but some trailer music until he got an email from Neill Blomkamp. Neill found some of Ryan's music on YouTube and tracked Ryan down to see if he wanted to score Elysium. No reason is known why District 9 composer Clinton Shorter wasn't invited back or decided not to continue the collaboration. Anyway, what Ryan has done here is incredibly impressive for someone who has no film scoring experience and definitely lays down some foundation for him to grow as a composer.Elysium is a bold action sci-fi flick that sort of plays out like a video game. Amon goes above the basic requirements and turns out a score that has a lot of character, textures and a grand scope. Giant orchestral sounds blend with rich electronic textures to craft a futuristic dystopia. The film itself butchers the score in my opinion as Blomkamp himself made Amon write music for 3-4 months or so without letting him see any footage or concepts. Blomkamp also moved a lot of the music around therefore disrupting the natural flow of things, and to add more unevenness threw in lots of source music. Hearing the music here in album form is a much better representation of Amon's intentions. And while Amon himself declared there was no temp track I did find a bit of an Inceptionish/Tronish hangover in the style of the music. Nothing wrong with it, but some of the action pieces lacked a certain inspiration to make an impact on the film. The emotional stuff is a bit heavy-handed in the film, but the score plays it well. In the end the score is an extremely fun ride even if it feels a bit uninspired. The score is expertly crafted and very rich in detail, but it was in its execution and structure where I found it to be very standard.Eysium is a fantastic effort from someone who has never scored a film before. Ryan Amon has tons of talent and you can't doubt his abilities. However, the shortcomings of the score can probably be pointed to inexperience and possibly a director who muddled a bit too much even though he's still a fledgling himself. It would be interesting to see Amon come back for Chappie (Blomkamp's next film) to see what he can do with a foundation already set. I think once Ryan Amon finds his signature voice we'll be in for a great treat. However as a composer who mainly writes trailer music one can imagine how many times he was asked to copy Inception or mimic Zimmer. That echoes into his score here. And while it doesn't hurt the execution and enjoyability it does leave the score feeling a bit familiar."
AE2SDFQQCDLED,B00DOQK2YG,5.0,"What a great collection of music! I'm not clear on why each song was chosen (haven't seen all episodes yet), but I like them all. This gets a lot of play at my house!"
A7YRO6JIVVG7D,B00DOQK2YG,5.0,Who knew NCIS had a soundtrack?  The music on this CD is contemporary and substantial.  I've listened to it all the way through 5 or 6 times now and have yet to find a track I don't like.  Having Pauley Perrette and Michael Weatherly sing on two separate songs is a sweet novelty but certainly not a necessity to the success of this album.  This is music for serious music lovers.
A2308EO9YZALPP,B00DORVS1G,5.0,Good to see someone who is up to the standards of Ramey and Talvela.  He has a large booming voice with an amazing ability to hold the note longer than anyone I've ever heard.
AQL2V899045AV,B00DOZNFRS,5.0,"this seemed different than CSoul's usual groove, but I really liked it.  I love reading all the inside stuff, and I really liked the music that they put in this CD."
A289KF2DQWIDRI,B00DOZNHDU,4.0,"Brace yourselves for chill: The second wave of Bossa Nova, oddly enough, may soon be upon us, and on their seventh album, Saudade, appropriately worldly D.C. Trip-Hop duo Thievery Corporation makes a new case for this often maligned, underdog genre's revival.Though a few scattered but earnest attempts to kick-start a full-on Bossa Nova wave over the past three decades have often come off too heavy-handed, the production falsely loud and glossy, undercooked, or ironic (blame Casio and thrift-store organs), nevertheless, due to the fact that its metronomic, consistently unchanging beats can be easily programmed using modern music-making tools, garnering both easy international credibility and sex appeal, it appears American producers are putting their noses to the grindstone of Jobim and Gilberto songbooks anew and devoting themselves to fake it 'till they make it.Tightly balanced and restrained in form, Bossa Nova is an easy genre on which to screw up the production, so you can expect to see plenty of the bad ideas that have doomed previous revival attempts reemerge as this temperate wave runs its course, especially through established artists already invested in these bad ideas. However, the genre has many stylistic limbs, and right out of the gates the new album from Thievery Corporation nails the core with only a modicum of spectacle.For the uninitiated, Bossa Nova is a complex Brazilian style which slows down to a crawl ultra-fast African Samba rhythms (the parent genre still probably too advanced for accurate regurgitation on an iPad) and pairs these rhythms with slowly morphing, distantly-related Jazz chords. This allows singers to do the heavy melodic lifting, arrangements stereotypically played light as a feather via the exclusive use of latin percussion and classical guitar plucking. This isn't exactly three-chord monte we're talking about here, but it does often serve to separate the men from the boys, so to speak, in several ways, as the genre is often acclaimed by both genders as one of the sexiest this side of Pornbient (ha!).The album at hand's title, Saudade, also a recently &#8220;NPR-ed&#8221; buzzword, is the emotional fuel that propels the Bossa Nova. The Portuguese noun is supposed to be a quality indescribable in English,but ain't nobody got time for that! If we figured out &#8220;Savoir Faire,&#8221; we can do this as well. Basically, saudade is a feeling of melancholy anticipation, of wishing and longing, often applied to unrequited love, encapsulated IN and illustrated AS Bossa Nova. Sort of like Emo, but for people who have clean carpets and some experience with the opposite sex other than resenting them.Enough context, right? How's the album? It's light, clean, but downright masterful, filled with beauty, nearly Bossa Nova perfection. I say nearly because while the physical arrangements here are amazingly well-crafted, some of the digital gloss in the background, like not-quite-convincing synth string sections and cymbal rises, do detract from the otherwise fantastic job the two-piece has done. On paper, the duo followed a solid outline for making an album for the attention spans of 2014 listeners: Most of the tracks clock in under two minutes, all but one feature vocals by different female singers, and rather than bundle strong songs together, every other song is great. The album features soulful but not showy singing in not only English, but also Italian, French, and, of course, Portuguese. This may be a deal-killer for some, but since these languages are the prettiest, spongiest on Earth, even if you're the sort turned off by movies with subtitles you can pretend the songs are about whatever lovely subject you desire while listening.Long time Thievery Corporation fans and dabblers of their catalog alike will be pleased to know that the duo's beats often sound both vintage and impressively timeless here, and the production, while faintly electronic, doesn't always sound like it, approaching the organic qualities of Portishead and early 60's R&B; while often channeling famous 1980's British songstress Sade on its best tracks.Sixties soundtrack lovers will fawn over the patented Henry Mancini strings in the mix of one early standout track that washes up on the album's shore called &#8220;No More Disguise,&#8221; while the closer, &#8220;Depth of My Soul&#8221; has a distinct Billie Holiday vibe. Perhaps the best track is a warm, anglicized curiosity named &#8220;Firelight&#8221; that acts as the perfect overall introduction to the album.Saudade is a breakthrough for the duo because unlike a lot of their work, it doesn't have a real time stamp on it. Yes, the cymbals tend to do that build thing you hear in modern Lounge a little too often on the flipside, like the before and after scenes from an episode of Hoarders, but since Thievery Corporation have made such a good album otherwise, we have to return them to the wild streets of D.C. with only a light slap on the wrists. A convincing illusion, after hearing this breezy cool record you'll want more Bossa Nova - and some of related, classy Lounge stuff the band peppers it with, too - not only because at forty-two minutes the album still felt short, but it acts as an antidote to what ails both modern American music and society.It's an escape to exotic lands, it's respite, it's true romance, and if you're already a fan of the increasingly re-popularized genres of Trip Hop and Bossa Nova, it's an affirmation that you're not crazy for being more into them lately. A likely sign of even more interesting things to come, Bossa Nova attempts a rebirth here, and Thievery Corporation, by subtly tweaking its golden ratios rather than attempt to restuff it in too much tacky modernity, has finally made a keeper.If you're into vinyl, this is a great pick. No other release in the month of April will likely conform to the format quite as naturally, because unlike most modern albums, this one actually works better the lower the fidelity of the device on which you play it. A listen on a phone or a laptop goes a very long way to completely hide the semi-detrimental slickness the band couldn't resist sometimes (but not always) including.An unexpected set of real, live songs from a band formerly known too often as middle of the road and mostly-instrumental, Saudade is an impressive genre family exploration, especially on a technical, engineer-friendly level, but as I said, though actually fairly lengthy by modern standards, it comes off as short &#8211; maybe because the songs are short, or perhaps this reviewer was just starting to get comfortable with it as it was almost over. If you're into Bossa Nova, you can't miss it. If you have no idea what the hell I've been talking about, this album makes an excellent introduction to the sound that you can digest without feeling overloaded by information. It's definitely worth a spin, so for fence-sitters, listen online so you can make up your mind to spend money on it after hearing it."
A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00DOZNHDU,5.0,"I have enjoyed several Thievery Corp albums, but this is my first foray into a vinyl release by them.  Boy was I happy I decided this was the album to purchase on said vinyl!According to the album, the two guys who started the band (Hilton and Garza) bonded over bossa nova and old movie soundtracks.  This album brings the duo back to their shared passion for these sounds.  Some folks might think it a bit... mellow... but that would be a misstatement.  The tracks are actually quite lively and often quick tempo.  The collaborators are very well matched to the sounds.  There is a lot of French and Brazilian influence.  Even with the first opening track (sung in French), I was mystified.  It makes a great album to listen to while otherwise occupied (reading, playing board games... other adult activities if you will).Bottom line: listen to the entire album once.  Then again.  By the end of the second listen through, you should be able to appreciate the album even more - knowing what to expect and all.  Others, myself included, will likely be amazed even with the first listen.  But at least give it a second go if you aren't completely on board with it.Vinyl also includes a ONE TIME mp3 download code.  So download it and back it up to CD just in case."
A2KCKHXP06LBRI,B00DOZNHDU,3.0,"As a longtime TC fan, I was expecting something livelier and more rhythmically diverse. Natalia Clavier's contribution is the strongest cut."
A3OFPY0N0DVTTX,B00DOZNJTM,4.0,"I'm really feeling this new album, im actually shocked, every joint I'm rockin, Very impressed, very grown up but still fresh, cool and sexy. Hes consistently reinventing his sound and not staying stuck to a certain style just because its trendy. The best part is it doesn't have lil wayne or 2 chain on it, thank goodness ;]"
AJNQTSR3IMW8Z,B00DOZNJTM,1.0,I'm sorry fam this is the lp is straight garbage and only as one decent track in my opinion. I've always felt marques had immense talent yet this lp falls on deaf ears and the fans who watched him from immature to imx to his solo career outta know consistency is the name of game and this cd fails to bring it and it seems he just mailed in it then put in work.
A2HT6Z8PP1RTJ6,B00DOZNJTM,3.0,"Marques Houston has released his sixth project \"Famous\"This 12 song project I have very mixed feelings about I'm not going to say it's garbage but no doubt a lack luster project and I'll explain why.I've been a fan of Marques Houston since the Immature/IMx years and by being the lead singer since he was 12 years old his vocals were perfect for singing soprano but now at the age of 32 Houston's voice has gotten much deeper and in my opinion he sounds much better when he sings in his lower register as you will hear on the track  \"Lifetime\" but trying to sing falsetto like a Prince, D' Angelo or Raheem Devaughn is just not cutting it for me although I feel he's a very talented artist but his vocals in my opinion really hurt this project even though musically it's pretty good which is why I give it 3 stars.My favorite track is \"Only You\" and I hope that he got clearance for using Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Get It On\" or else I won't be surprised the Gaye family will try to sue him like they did Robin Thicke...LOL!Other notable mentions for \"Famous\" are \"Take Your Love Away\", \"Nothin' On You\", \"Give Your Love A Try\" and \"Lifetime\"I still believe Marques Houston best album to date is \"Naked\" followed by \"Mattress Music\" but hopefully his next project will be much better than \"Famous\".Purchase only if you are a TRUE Marques Houston fan otherwise just get the singles you like."
A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DOZRRAE,4.0,"I recently saw Icona Pop in concert (more on that later). If you are new to them, Icona Pop is a Swedish duo consisting of Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt, bringing jubilant dance-oriented music (not unlike, say, Lights, Little Boots, Robyn, etc). They have been building some serious buzz with their early releases, in particular last year's EP called \"Iconinc EP\". Now comes the debut album.\"This Is... Icona Pop\" (11 tracks; 33 min.) is frontloaded with the album's strongest tracks, starting with the opener \"I Love It (feat. Charli XCX)\", with its irresistible and thunderous chorus. \"I Love It\" is the band's breakout hit and signature song so far (it also appeared on last year's EP). The songs follow one another fast and with a furious energy (which is a good thing). \"All Night\" sounds like another single in the waiting. \"We Got the World\" features the synth-and-drum sound prominently (it reminds me of Ke$ha actually). \"Ready for the Weekend\" (another holdover from that EP) is yet another irresistible sing-along. Highlights on the second half of the album include \"In the Stars\", which make you want to jump up and down as you scream out the chorus, and the same can be said for \"On A  Roll\", and \"Light Me Up\". The weakest/least interesting song on here is the closer, a short \"Then We Kissed\". But in the end, that's a quibble. If you like fun, dance-oriented music, you cannot go wrong with this album.Just a few weeks ago I saw Icona Pop live at the Laneway festival at the Meadow Brook near Detroit. The girls played in the late afternoon, and brought a tremendous 45 min. which the enthusiastic crowd absolutely ate up. They played just about all of the tracks from the then still unreleased new album, and a couple of older tracks from the EPs. Icona Pop were one of the biggest surprises (in the best possible way) for me from the entire festival. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \"This Is... Icona Pop\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
A3RO4KFTKX54IS,B00DPKQ60A,4.0,"Ok, so maybe with a little bit more time and training she can be the next (dare I say it)....Mariah"
A1S4S0ZPS10KLI,B00DPKQ60A,5.0,"I feel in love with her incredible voice, first time I hear her song &#34;The Way&#34;, I believed she was the love of my life Mariah Carey, but she isn't Mariah, even her voice technique is similar, but at the same time is different."
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00DPKQ60A,5.0,Ariana Grande is hot and her music is great to listen to. I really love looking at her and listening to her sing is an added bonus.
AOF3FCGVF4UO6,B00DPKQ60A,5.0,"There are some voices that just grab hold of you the moment you first hear them. Hearing Mariah Carey's Vision of Love for the first time was one of those moments for me. I can say the same thing about hearing The Way for the first time. Ariana Grande is a talent we will talking about for years to come. So how is the record? Here is my take on each song:1) Honeymoon Avenue: This midtempo cut opens with lush orchestrations that perfectly complement Grande's light airy pitch-perfect instrument. Clean uncluttered production pushes her voice front and center where it should be. Great opener.2)Baby I: Killer groove. Her vocals here are unmistakably reminiscent of early Mariah Carey. This song feels like Grande's tribute to Carey's Emotions.3) Right There: Grande's vocals float over the addictive melody and the hook is strong. She tosses off multi-octave leaps and flips from head to chest voice without breaking a sweat.4)Tattooed Heart: This feels like a 2013 take on a '50's doo-wop song. Here Ariana enters into Bruno Mars territory with retro-soul. A flawless vocal.5) Lovin' It: Grande's lush vocals elevate this uptempo pop confection. Slick production lays her dazzling multi-tracked vocals over a sizzling rhythmic beat.6) Piano: I love this cut. It hearkens back to the work Clivilles and Cole did with Mariah Carey. It reminds me of Make It Happen-inspirational pop at its best.7) Daydreamin': Another song with a 50s doo-wop feel. Listen to the way she bends the notes on the words \"I'll be yours\" in the chorus. This is a singer with SERIOUS musical chops.8) The Way: Irresistible pop, killer hook, perfectly produced. And those whistle tones-OMG.It was love at first listen. And the torch is passed from Minnie Riperton to Mariah Carey to Ariana Grande.9) You'll Never Know: The vocals are spot-on but this tune feels generic to me, nothing memorable.10)Almost Is Never Enough: Finally a ballad and she caresses the melody with her warm silky tones-meltingly beautiful. Nathan Sykes acquits himself well as her duet partner. Reminds me of Boyz II Men's End of the Road.11) Popular Song: This was one of my favorite cuts on Mika's CD The Origins of Love. Mika's vocal dominates this song and she plays more of a supporting role. But another flawless vocal from Grande. (\"Wicked\" fans will hear a snippet from the musical)12)Better Left Unsaid: Ariana meets Black Eyed Peas. She seriously wails on this but the song is kind of a throwaway.I highly recommend this album to fans of either of the first two singles. Not all of the material is as strong as her vocal talents are deserving of, but this is one of those instruments that doesn't come along very often. Grande, I am yours truly!"
A3SGQNA31JB18P,B00DPKQ60A,5.0,"I had been anticipating Ariana Grande's album all summer long and now that it's here, it is absolutely amazing. I had a feeling Ariana's album would become a hit.The album starts out with \"Honeymoon Avenue.\" It may sound different from the original version heard on YouTube, but in my opinion, this version is much better especially with the violin strings in it.The tracks \"The Way,\" \"Baby I,\" \"Right There,\" \"You'll Never Know\" and \"Lovin' It\" have that '90s throwback R&B; vibe to it which makes the album sound magnificent.The songs \"Tattooed Heart\" and \"Daydreamin\" has that '50s\\'60s throwback style and Ariana's beautiful vocals make them sound amazing!\"Almost is Never Enough\" with the Wanted's Nathan Sykes has to be the best song on the album. This ballad is so beautiful, you just want to listen to it over and over again.Ariana is one talented young woman and also a rising, shining star. If you're a fan of Ariana Grande's music, then you don't want to miss out on her debut album."
A21QPN2PEVRRUM,B00DPKQ60A,4.0,"I gave this as a Christmas gift, so I did not open it and listen to it.  I guess I would have liked it."
A2MIJYUH0L6TNE,B00DPKQ60A,1.0,"Slick production sinks this. Rap guest performers are non-talented and destroy any flow this album might have had. Ariana voice is so wasted, the production and songs just plain sucks. It's so bad she sounds like 10,000 other girl singers. She needs to dump the whole team behind this mess."
A1Q2GLZXL2CNJ8,B00DPKQ60A,5.0,NIce that her name truly reflects her vocal power. I am sure the decision to use that last name was a consideration.  Very nice debut with a very delectable assortment of upbeats tracks that uplift and keep you looking forward to the next.  She is definitely one to watch.
A21Q8TYJO50OCU,B00DPKQ70E,5.0,Fell in love with these guys when their first song came out &#34;she is love.  Then to hear it on a tv commercial made it even better.. these guys have talent.
A2A0F32PJAM772,B00DPKQBFK,2.0,I expected the music to all be by Alabama. Only two songs are theirs. The rest are by their &#34;friends&#34;.
AVYHWCIW5LNAX,B00DPKQBFK,5.0,"This is an excellent tribute to legendary country music band Alabama by who is who in country music with their own versions of some of Alabama's great hits in this CD release titled 'Alabama & Friends' (11 tracks). The great and influential country music band Alabama (from Fort Payne, Alabama) has been in the music business for 40 years and they have two beautiful brand new tunes in this CD (their first in 10 years) namely \"That's How I Was Raised\" (a song about being raised in a religious family in Alabama, great tune and my pick of the best of their  two new tunes) & \"All American\".Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \"Old Flame\" (wonderful melody and vocals) by Rascal Flatts, \"Lady Down On Love\" (slow-tempo song with a great orchestral base track & wonderful melody) by Kenny Chesny, \"Forever's Far As I'll Go\" (beautiful melody and vocals) by Trisha Yearwood, \"I'm In A Hurry (I Don't Know Why)\" (up-tempo track with great melody) by Florida Georgia Line & \"That's How I Was Raised\" by Alabama.Other friends/artists are Jason Aldean with \"Tennessee River\", Luke Bryan with \"Love In The First Degree\", Eli Young Band with \"The Closer You Get\", Toby Keith with \"She And I\" and Jamey Johnson with \"My Home's In Alabama\". There is no weak track or CD filler in this tribute album.On overall, it's a no stone unturned effort in this tribute to country great band Alabama: really excellent versions of Alabama's great hits by who's who in country music and the country music party has to be in Fort Payne and thus all roads lead to Alabama in this CD 'Alabama & Friends'. A highly recommended CD listening. A well deserved 5 star performance."
AAUQDL5ZNN040,B00DPKQBFK,5.0,I have been listening to Alabama since they first started singing; I love their music and songs! They are a great group!
A1YOTBQ1FOF1G5,B00DPMFDRA,4.0,"I love BT, and have been listening to him since mid to late 90's. A Song Across Wires, is good album, however keep in mind, that it's missing that amazing flare of These Hopeful Machines, his last album. This album is like BT got in a room together with Skrillex, Swedish House Mafia, Avicii and came up with a dance album to pay homage to this guys, who would've followed BT and then BT even paying homage to his old styles from the 90's and early 2000's too.What lacks is the length of the songs, they're all under 5mins some only 3 mins or so, and that, in my opinion makes the album suffer.It's still a good album, just not as memorable as his earlier work. Standouts: Skylarking, Surrounded, Love Devine, Calling Your Name"
AFTUQKTL3Z4JK,B00DPUB5S8,5.0,"Rather than including lyrics, a member of the band has written a note on each song.Now I can officially say I own every song Rise Against has ever made.Not to mention all the excellent songs on it; Tonight We Dance, Lanterns, Dirt and Roses, and well, the whole bloody thing.If you're a Rise Against fan in the slightest, you will no regret the purchase."
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00DQBWLSO,4.0,"It's difficult to focus on John Mayer's music when he's such an idiot, but the guy can make great music. This album is a continuation of of his ability to make enjoyable music."
A2HOPYNO8PMUHP,B00DQBWLSO,5.0,And mellow together is how to describe the works of this extremely talented artist who masters many instruments and plays them in addition to writing his own lyrics. Meyer does it all.
AWPUJYU4ENQX4,B00DQBWLSO,5.0,love it  best in a long time
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00DQBWLSO,3.0,"After spinning this disc three times, I can tell it's not my favorite CD.  The problem is with the songwriting that seems often melodically unoriginal and lyrically bland.  Two strong exceptions on the disc are the bouncy opening track &#34;Wildfire&#34; that sounds  catchy and radio-friendly, &#34;You and me been catching on like a wild fire.&#34;  The other track is equally catchy with Katy Perry on guest vocals on &#34;Who You Love&#34; which has such a sweet lyric, showing that one can't fake love; you either love someone or you don't.  Unfortunately the rest of the disc blends forgettably for me, but I do really like these two tracks.  Enjoy!"
A3BESD9E51DR4L,B00DQBWLSO,5.0,"I have to say I like john mayer but it was something if I heard it on the radio I enjoyed it but it wasn't anything I reached for - this CD is on repeat in the car and at home. Some tracks on here I can not get enough of Dear Marie, Paper Doll, Who You Love, I WIll Be Found... everyone I play it for says who is this?? it always surprises  them, we all agree this one is a serious winner! He sounds relaxed, happy and his guitar work is brilliant. looking forward to seeing him perform live at the hollywood bowl!"
A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B00DQBWLSO,1.0,"Once upon a time in the imaginary land of Mayerville, a raggedy used up & washed out hobo from the streets accidentally chanced upon a guitar and took to pawing at it with his considerably large talons while contorting his face in a series of expressions that can only be termed as unfortunate. Between this depressing visual spectacle and the sounds that ensued from both guitar and hobo&#8217;s oral orifice, an entire town entered that quaint state of being that we in these times refer to as bankruptcy. Years later, while banging away at the same guitar with a most misplaced gusto, the hobo chances upon a gigantic blow up doll that also dabbles in &#8216;music&#8217;, conjuring up a dream team even Lucifer couldn&#8217;t quite put together if he wanted to. Defying all laws of photometry & biochemistry, the two cadavers traveled the length and breadth of the township reducing infants to tears & sending their elderly grandparents to a very early grave. Now they&#8217;re releasing a duet. Suffice to say this harsh treatment meted out to you, the most disrespected listener, is something one wouldn&#8217;t wish upon Mussolini. A great use for this disc is to fling it in the air, pretend it&#8217;s a UFO, & call NASA insisting you&#8217;ve broken the code. Avoid."
A8SZFVE7R7K9O,B00DQBWLSO,5.0,"If you are a John Mayer fan, this is one fun CD. Great music from one of today's primere artists"
A1A7SPFSGPFMW5,B00DQBWLSO,5.0,Glad I got this on vinyl + free CD in the package. John just gets better and better. May be his best yet.
A3UKLX2A9T589C,B00DQBWLSO,4.0,"Okay, first album was pop, he did what he needed to get himself out there and be able to do what he WANTED. So, he gave us some sweet blues that would make SRV proud. And now he offers up something that is just simple, easy listening music. This is a Mayer album that you don't have to sit and try to deconstruct his blues licks or get past the pop. It is a happy medium where you can just listen, relax, and enjoy. Waitin' on the Day is my favorite track, but there is something here for everybody."
APVSMGDH9XLRC,B00DQBWM10,5.0,"My experience with most musicians is that the older they get, the more they drift away from their original music. Moby included! But the great thing with Moby is that he is still improving his music, where most others are not as good anymore as when they started! Great to listen, great to hear. Part or my 'Perfect Life' ;-)"
A2KP62ZRRNHMGC,B00DQRHMM8,5.0,"Ferg brings the heat with his debut LP. I always liked him from the start when I heard his verse on ASAP Rocky's \"Kissin' Pink\" back in 2011. The beats on this thang go in. The guest rappers all brought the heat. That Work Remix is crazy. Let It Go, Shabba, Hood Pope, Fergavicious are all crazy tracks. Something different. You got to check this album out for yourself, but you won't be disappointed. Ferg is the truth."
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00DQRHNJA,5.0,"After failing miserably a few years earlier with a 14-track collection titled Essential (while Dolly Parton and others were given a 40-track compilation), Tammy's fans have finally been rewarded with a 40-track compilation of Tammy's music. It's not quite perfect as it includes Too far gone, the B-side of one of Tammy's singles, while omitting several other candidates for inclusion, but it does contain all of Tammy's solo top ten country hits.Several top twenty hits are missing, and some of Tammy's big hits with George Jones are also missing, though these duets can all be found on compilations focusing just on their duets together. Although not a hit, Tammy's duet with the Beach Boys (on a cover of their song In my room) would have been more appealing to me than Too far gone. I do like Tammy's recording of Too far gone, which was eventually a country hit for Barbara Fairchild, but its inclusion here does seem odd.Minor quibble aside, this is a magnificent double CD of Tammy's music. I see that one American reviewer of this compilation is suggesting that Bear Family may be planning a boxed set. It's the first I've heard of the possibility, but in view of the recent release of the Porter and Dolly duets boxJust Between You and Me: The Complete Recordings 1967-76on the same label (which encourages me to hope that Bear Family might eventually release of Dolly's solo music from the sixties and early seventies), it wouldn't surprise me. I'm a huge fan of both Dolly and Tammy, so I'll be very pleased if Bear Family release more of their music. So far Tammy's fans have been poorly catered for in the CD era. In the early days of CD, Dolly's fans didn't do much better, but while the situation with her music is not perfect, most of her music is now available on CD. Maybe Tammy's fans don't have too long to wait. Meanwhile, this double CD will help to tide us over."
AXES3BCL6SW3V,B00DQRHNPY,5.0,"I have been wanting some Bill Withers & this is a 2 disc very good collection. It is not as comprehensive as his complete anthology offered as well by Amazon, but it is not as costly. The other set has recordings from the Sussex label if I am correct.. One can check themselves, but I am very satisfied with the majority of work on this set. I may invest in his complete recordings. Thank You"
A262O8WGF760GY,B00DQUQ5VO,5.0,"Neal McCoy is a great person, I love his music.  He sings Charley Prides songs very well. I love Charlie Pride's song's and Neal does a great version of them.  It is good to hear them sung differently and liked a lot."
A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00DR98EYK,5.0,"The success of London Grammar's &#34;If You Wait&#34; is remarkable evidence that trip hop music is alive and well more than 20 years down the road. &#34;If You Wait&#34; has the ambient production values, the ethereal moodiness and the minimalist approach of classic trip hop with it's own unique stamp of of lead singer Hannah Reid's brooding, plaintive vocals. Hannah's vocals have been compared to Beth Gibbons of Portishead, but to me she sounds more like the great Sandy Denny of the 60s era rock band Fairport Convention.I enjoyed this album as much any electronic or rock oriented album released in 2013 and even though London Grammar has yet to break through in the United States, they're already stars in the UK, most of Europe and Australia."
AGRYDACL809GW,B00DRGQZPS,5.0,"Here's the short story - This is as good as anything that Over the Rhine has put out.When I first listened to this I thought it was another very nice OtR cd, much as I have somewhat grown to expect with almost every release they have put out. But the more I listened the more I felt compelled to start from the beginning again and again. Meet Me At The Edge Of The World is a fully realized work in every sense, a genuine cohesive, gorgeous album from start to finish.What do I like about it? Karin sounds as wonderful as ever. Her voice is so evocative and expressive, completely married to the lyrics and the music. The songs are fantastic, great melodies. I usually don't think much about production unless it is noticeably bad or exceptional. This is exceptional. OtR has found a producer, Joe Henry, that has given these songs the perfect setting to showcase the wonderful musicianship here.Linford and Karin's lyrics are remarkable.  They work often as poetry alone, but coupled with the music they really shine. Here are a few of my favorites.From \"Wait\":Life is a beauty that's mocking youShe's a river to drown in while singing the bluesLet the backstroke pull you inOn your lover you descendLeaving your mark without leaving a bruiseFrom \"Wildflower Bouquet\":If I die in the winter send rosesIn the spring, magnoliasIf I'm called in the summer or in the fallBest of all - bring me a wildflower bouquetIn the dirt and clay don't lay me downAnd stare at a cold lonely hole in the groundWhen I go to my Maker in smoke and ashIt won't be your grief I craveYour tears will not be necessaryBuild a blazing fire, drink something merryWhen the sparks fly off into the windThat will be me blowing awayFrom \"Sacred Ground\":Love me like a memory held too longLike the need to feel some forgotten songKiss me to chills like there's only meLike it's hard to kill the last cottonwood treeLove me later when the stars fall downA burning light for a wedding gownDo I have anything negative to say about Meet Me At The Edge Of The World? Only one thing. It's not a genuine double album. My guess is that Karin and Linford wanted to separate the 2 sets of songs which were recorded at slightly different times. But both cds only total 70 minutes, easily fitted on a single disc.But that is an insignificant complaint, compared to what is given to us here. Often I will buy a cd by one of my favorite artists and, even though I appreciate that it is a quality work, have little desire to listen often. Not the case here. Over The Rhine have given me something that I will probably listen to hundreds of times over the coming years."
A3PX0QDC9X7BL5,B00DRGQZPS,5.0,"I'm not a prolific album reviewer and have been only a casual fan of OTR, though I do have quite a bit of their stuff. I'm the first to admit that music is in the taste of the listener, but I don't understand the negative reviews.  This is a top-notch album from start to finish.  The songs are great, the sound quality is great and the performances are great.  It's not an album that will have one dancing on tables, but it's an extraordinarily satisfying listen for those who appreciate this style of music. It's obvious to me that it's be time for me to become more than a casual fan of this band."
A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9,B00DRGR0ZW,4.0,"A few days ago I heard Nick Lowe interviewed on Adam Carolla's podcast.  He just released a quirky Christmas album and performed one of the tracks live and it was rock solid--one of the best live studio performances I've ever heard.According to the interview, Nick Lowe is a Brit who specializes in what they used to call Pub Rock, which is where Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and he sharpened their chops back in the 80s.  Lowe is an older gent now, but he can still belt it out.  The first track is a hard hitting Memphis blues version of the old standard Children Go Where I Send Thee.  It's good enough to make some hairs stand up.He has some great original tracks, like Christmas At The Airport, which was especially poignant for me when I bought this album from Amazon downloads at LAX the same day I heard the interview.I'd give this album a strong 7 out of 10, not my favorite Christmas album, but still fun.  It's in the category of stuff that I'll gladly listen to, but that my wife will hate.  I'll listen to it at work or driving around, but I probably won't put it on the playlist for our Christmas party.  I'd love to hear these tracks mixed in on some of the XM Christmas stations though.Nice work Mr. Lowe.  And by the way, your interview with Carolla was one of the best interviews I've heard in ages.EDIT:  I've owned this album for less than a week and I've already heard two tracks playing in different stores, evidently over XM or whatever Muzak they subscribe to.  Way to go Nick Lowe!"
A2YP74VN60T8A8,B00DRGR0ZW,4.0,"I'm a holiday music collector and these two songs - which I consider the creme of this crop are worth the price of admission.  One is a rockabilly version of a rarely heard carol classic.  The other a wandering, humorous pop singer/songwriter ditty about falling asleep at the airport."
AA1JQ35B4Y3RJ,B00DRGR0ZW,5.0,What  can you say--a  New  Nick  Lowe  Cd--Christmas  typerecord--with  a  Nick  Lowe  Twist--songs  that  I  love on this&#34;Christmas  at  the  Airport&#34;  &  Hooves  on  the  Roof&#34;.Who  says  Christmas  records/cd's  Have  to  be  boring.This  is  not  one of  those.  Way  to go Nick.
A2YHLBUF1OTDNN,B00DRIMVK4,5.0,"Perfect for a bad day.  Can't listen to it without smiling!If you don't have this yet, it's is a MUST have.  It is also good for workouts too.I have also enjoyed her &#34;What If We Were Real&#34; album."
A2CGDLNRPVZASX,B00DRIMVK4,5.0,Every time I listen to this CD I feel like I've had a little breath of God breathed into me. Very uplifting and Mandisa is an inspiration to me.
A21QD0YBZ71TCC,B00DRIMVK4,4.0,Wow!  Powerful vocals and tremendous witness on this CD.  You can tell she believes what she is singing about.  I let my 6 year old niece listen and she took my copy so I will have to et another.  But if a 6 year old likes the music that's saying something!  Very soulful and powerful listening experience.
A347WOIGVPRXR2,B00DRIMVK4,5.0,Every cd Mandisa does Stands out to me. All the songs touch my Heart. As Mandisa continue on i see her grow more Stronger in Christ with each album that she does. What i love about this album is it has more of a Pop upbeat feel. The songs are fun dance to but at the same time the songs are declaring Jesus Love for us. I love the powerful statements in the lyrics of the songs. Her song Dear John makes me cry for the lost loves ones in my family. Her song what scars are for really change my life for the BEST Lord knows why to :) Any time you feel sad or depressed you need to play this album. It is uplifting & it inspired me to lift my head up and smile for JESUS :)
A3UCCGOG903V0W,B00DRIMVK4,4.0,"Mandisa continues to be a voice of encouragement and truth to women facing life's challenges. She returns with her new album Overcomer on August 27th. Featuring the new single \"Overcomer,\" the album's theme centers on the idea that there is hope in the midst of life's battles. That theme is a continuation of the empowering message from her hit song \"Stronger.\" I've been married for 19 years and have 3 young daughters and this entire album really ministers to me and my family. I've seen how women in particular tend to beat themselves up about mistakes and feeling overwhelmed by life.The opening songs, \"Overcomer\" and \"Back To You\" are very upbeat and catchy songs and Mandisa is a surefire GMA Dove Award nominee for female vocalist. I can't get enough of the biblical and worshipful chorus of \"Overcomer\"--\"You're an overcomer / Stay in the fight `til the final round / You're not going under / `Cause God is holding you right now / You might be down for a moment / Feeling like it's hopeless / That's when He reminds You / That you're an overcomer.\" The song is such a great reminder that there is hope in Jesus, who tells us in John 16:33 (NIV): \"In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\" Amen to that!\"The Distance,\" \"Press On\" and \"What Scars Are For\" are all very vulnerable songs about accepting God's grace and forgiveness in the face of self-doubt. Stand out moments of this very solid album include the ultra-catchy dance tempo songs, \"Face 2 Face\" and \"At All Times.\" These are relevant and catchy songs in any music format. I don't listen to much electronic dance music, as I'm more of a rock, contemporary and worship music listener, however the beats on this album are so engaging; this album is already in heavy rotation for me. One of Mandisa's strengths in addition to her soothing and strong vocals are her infectious and engaging lyrics.I love the joyfulness of \"Joy Unspeakable,\" which is another fun and worshipful song, with Mandisa belting out a super-infectious song with an electronic/dub-step/pop arrangement, and more prayerful and sincere lyrics. As God's children, it brings comfort to think of Him smiling down on us dancing before the Lord with a joy unspeakable. That's what Mandisa is all about, loving God with all of her heart, expressed in one catchy song after another.A song that stops me in my tracks is the evangelistic Gospel message song, \"Dear John,\" co-written with Plumb. Thank you, Mandisa for including such a bold message on this album. The album ends with another personal declaration and prayer, \"Where You Begin.\" Lord, thank You for amazing Christian music artists like Mandisa who love You and want to glorify Your Name through their songs. Thank You for giving Mandisa the gift of singing so that she can give her offerings of praise and worship \"Back to You.\"Closing Thoughts (Staff Review, NewReleaseTuesday.com)Mandisa is a great role model for girls struggling with identity issues and has a great platform from her success on American Idol, appearances on Good Morning America, and GRAMMY and GMA Dove Award nominations. This album is loaded with positive grace-filled messages of hope from someone who has struggled with the pressures of life and understands that true happiness and empowerment only comes from her relationship with God. You'll won't be able to help but dance and sing along with the stand-out songs, \"Overcomer,\" \"Back To You,\" \"Face 2 Face,\" \"Press On\" and the ultra-catchy, \"Joy Unspeakable.\" This album is all about knowing for a fact the Truth of 1 John 4:4 (NKJV): \"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.\""
A2FFS0XQH4ILD7,B00DS7Z4IK,5.0,"I'm not sure what this genre is called but these guys are like the Led Zeppelin of it. Was wondering if they could top their last one, well I believe they did. Every sound they make wreaks of soul, whether its the drums, the guitar, the vocals. I feel like I'm drinking a cold Bud standing in a just harvested corn field at midnight when I listen to this."
A2C1JTOEZCIVZC,B00DSAUNXI,5.0,They delivered a true sounding 100% blues album. Great contributions (harmonica & vocals) by Kim Wilson!This CD is very good and it's definitely a good buy.Can't wait to see them live again!
AKAZT5193KFR1,B00DSAUNXI,5.0,"I live in a rural, isolated community devoid of soul and black people. It is our loss. This album is a prime example of what we're missing. These guys play as only those who feel the music, who love the music, and who down right know how to play the music can.This is some bad ass blues!"
A3034NA1R7SJDL,B00DSTBMMU,1.0,I found this album to be a major disappointment. Sheryl has shown the ability to make soulful country music in past performances with Willie Nelson and others. However this album is hardly country at all..... Big rock drums and guitar riffs.... Only not done as well as she has in the past..... Just a boring pandering soulless offering sad
AL6LA0DYESCUG,B00DSTBMMU,5.0,Sheryl Crow's voice is beautiful. For her &#34;first&#34; foray in making a country album she knocked it out of the park. From We Oughta Be Drinking to Waterproof Mascara there is something for everyone to love!!!
AYT8KFJU1DZ39,B00DSTBMMU,4.0,"Although, she is still one of my favorites, the Feels Like Home CD is nothing like her previous one. Actually, I like the last one better because it had a more southern rock sound. Her new CD is very country.....At first I did not like it much but it grows on you. I'm starting to like it now after listening to it many times."
A1U8PM2SXOWNXK,B00DSTBMMU,5.0,"It's been awhile since hearing from Ms. Crow. This LP is well worth the wait. Sheryl is in fine form, vocally and musically..."
A2M37S7ZTJ890W,B00DSTBMMU,5.0,"This is some fine music. Enjoyable and easy to listen to. Give it a listen, kick back, and enjoy! I did!"
A2RL0MEBFHB7YK,B00DT55PB2,3.0,"I love these songs and I have multiple versions of most of them  I like Ry Cooder and this recoding shows off his great production and playing abilities. The arrangements however lack inspiration, and the final product has a gloss to it but lacks emotional depth that can make these songs go from \"nice\" to material that others make me stop in my tracks when performed. The vocals are terrific on a technically level, but arrangements allow very little chance for reach into your soul as the vocal blend is about perfect harmonies not about touching the human soul. Not a bad record (\"Raining\", \"Billy Bee\" stand out for me), but I do recommend searching out for recordings of this material done with a bit more grit."
ADVAF8ZTNROC3,B00DTGSE28,4.0,"Very good folk overview. I hope this is as commercially successful as the O Brother soundtrack, because I feel it is as critically successful. I even like Please, Mr. Kennedy."
A34FLLMO5BTTU7,B00DTGSE28,5.0,"Another great soundtrack from the Coen Brothers and TBone! enjoyable from start to finish.  Nice, stout record sleeve and heavy duty vinyl.  No regrets in buying this record."
A30J0KX6L70X10,B00DTGSE28,2.0,"I suppose it was to be expected with the current popularity of zombies in popular culture that we would finally get a zombie musical.  At least that's what I assume this is considering how lifeless the performances on this soundtrack album are.  I loved the soundtrack of \"O Brother\", but with each new project since then I get the feeling that T Bone Burnett is determined to suck the life and soul out of America's music.  Yes, everything here is extremely well played and tasteful, but the end result gives me the same feeling I get when I see a well made up corpse at a wake.  Yea, every hair is in place and the make-up is exquisitely applied and the clothes are perfect, but none of that can change the fact that the spark of life is gone.  Like that corpse, this music is a comely shell with no soul.I grew up listening to the folk musicians of this era.  I love this music and I always look forward to a new twist, a new take on it.  I love hearing younger musicians taking the music and making it their own.  That's how the music stays alive and vital.  So I'm open to new interpretations by new people.  But this recording has nothing to say about the music. \"A Mighty Wind\" was a parody of this era and music and yet it's soundtrack comes much closer to catching the spirit of the real thing than anything on the \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" soundtrack does.Perhaps these performances work better in the context of the movie than they do standing on their own, but the best thing I can say for this bland soundtrack is that it will probably be quite serviceable as background muzak in your local branch of Starbucks and Whole Foods."
A25W3CAJ9V1JRO,B00DTGSE28,5.0,"I have some original folk music from the 1960's, but none of it sounds this good.  This album is AMAZING...really incredible.  It's so good, it almost hurts.  Oscar Isaac has a truly phenomenal talent.  The harmonies are undeniable in their impact.  &#34;The Auld Triangle&#34; blows me away every time I listen to it, as do &#34;Five Hundred Miles&#34; and the duet version of &#34;Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song).&#34;  The problem is that Peter, Paul and Mary sound so average now."
A143VWWW5CGG2S,B00DTGSE28,5.0,"I just adored this upbeat and musically superior movie which accurately catches the real flavor of the Folk movement.  All the singers in the movie especially Dave Van Ronk, are much better today than actual singers from that period, however.  That is the only part I found unconvincing.Listen to these songs and marvel at how the Coen Bros are able to write a better song TODAY than those of the period.  I mean who would YOU rather listen to?  Isaac or The Kingston Trio?  The Highwaymen?  The Greenbriar Boys?  Bob Dylan?  Meh.Dave Van Ronk and Lou N Davis are better than Joan Baez ever was and it is not fair to make such a moving musical soundtrack today and then somehow accidentally listen to the pathetic offerings from the actual period.  Today's experts have for once grasped how great it is to have movie makers like the Coens around.This movie is the greatest movie in the entire history of the universe and I am NOT exaggerating even one teensy tiny bit, my friends.  I guarantee you will leave the theater stunned.The plot revolves around a magic cat which coughs up Welsh Rarebit on command.  A ravenous John Goodman is in town promoting his new vegan diet book.  The cat interrupts a stage performance of Bob Dylan (who is LOUSY compared to all the new singers here) and the hairball immediately starts a national craze for Welsh Rarebit.Happy, contented, straight Folk singers and Folk songwriters who neither drink whiskey, use cocaine nor smoke weed---now THIS is a VERY accurate portrait of how it &#34;really was&#34; back then.  I especially appreciated the whole cast performing live at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival.  The Welsh sailing songs they sang while holding hands (which closed out the festival) were so powerful and moving it is no wonder Pete Seeger immediately tossed Bob Dylan off the stage for being a no talent loser.The quality of the lyrics here is, however, of a caliber unknown to such performers of the actual period such as John Sebastian, McGuinn and McGuire and Mama Cass and the Mugwumps...  Again, by tinkering a bit around the edges the Coens display an uncanny feel for a great song.  Every song here is a real toe tapper and a hoot to boot!I can only imagine the movie soundtrack, like the movie itself, will win a best Oscar in every existing category and  that a few new categories will have to be invented to encompass the incredible brilliance of the Coens.If you believe in the Coens, clap your hands!  Are you a Coenhead?Hip hip hooray! for this brilliant soundtrack and incredible movie..."
A166HWXRWC92IM,B00DTVVHPO,5.0,I've been a Parsons fan since I got this when it first came out. It was nice to see a remaster along with an interesting booklet and the bonus CD. Keep 'em coming!
A1PKFYJSWZ272J,B00DU11F64,3.0,The playing is outstanding but the sound quality is not very good. I also have no use for live albums with dead space between songs-let it play! The song selection is very interesting but the continuity on this set sucks. Only for a mega fan.
AC1UOIA4ERNS4,B00DU11F64,2.0,"I am a big Jefferson Starship fan (up until Earth) and always liked how rough they sounded live. This is one band that always sounded better in the studio. Live, they were just all over the place. Some call this their \"greatest' concert. It is back when they were actually getting along (would love to see this on video!) and some of their best work was Dragonfly, Red Octypus, and Spitfire. This is still worth having as a collectable, but the sound on this CD is distorted and recorded WAY TOO LOUD. I can barely handle thirty minutes of it. Barely turn it up and IT'S TOO LOUD. Maybe that's what people expect, but I want to control the master volume and not let the mixers control it. This is shocking in itself that this is from RCA label. They should have toned it down MANY decibles for my liking. Maybe now that I am older, I don't need it that LOUD. It's like figernails going down the chalk board.Let me know other audiophiles. Am I right on this? I know the die-hard fanboys will be more forgiving, but this fan has waited too many years for this to be released when the mixers botched it. Let me know what you think.Also on my receiver I turn the volume down to -65 and it is still too LOUD. What is up?"
A3THNIRDXSIS05,B00DU11F64,3.0,"Yes the sound is sub-par, but I have heard worse.  Worse mixing, instrument definition and stereo imaging, and at full, regular price. I'm not an audiophile, but I understand the argument that bad sound is bad music. What I can't get away from is that I like listening to this record. There was probably a good reason for leaving this in the vaults and I'll take off a star because of the distortion and hiss, but I don't mind the raggedness&#8230;it's sometimes a fine line between &#34;enjoyable&#34; and &#34;ouch!&#34; with this type of recording.  It's an historical document, not a live album as such. I compared the levels of this with the FM version, and it is noticeably louder. Minus another star. This over-compression thing has to stop, no-one can blame that on the source tape."
A1MHFO1841U6X7,B00DU1KYMK,5.0,I anxiously awaited the release of this album and I was not disappointed! This is truly a work of art! Great job Justin!
A2SX619MKCU2FD,B00DU1KYMK,5.0,"Great album, love Justin's voice. Shame that he chose to have his &#34;kenwood's banging&#34; a rather a better quality of speakers!The duet with Miranda is one of the best tracks.Justin is one of the most down to earth of the current country singers."
A3NMWU8AUFBZ7L,B00DUE8IXY,5.0,"This is a great record.  Buy it now. Sometimes, it doesn't take that many words to make a review.  This record exceeded my expectations."
A2980CNQE4H3OQ,B00DUGPD1W,5.0,"Terri Nunn - met her three times -  once in 80's (Count Three & Pray Tour), once at The Fillmore West in San Francisco - mid 90's and at the L.A. Gay Pride Parade Concert in 2009. She sound just as good as ever. Great album (yes kiddies - it's called an album)."
A2DX2MMCQHNU6G,B00DURHYWC,5.0,"As usual Pink Martini took unfamiliar music and made it their own.  I love this album and almost cried when Phyllis Diller finished singing.  Thank you, P.M. for convincing her to do that song.  Now I have an audio memory of a lady I enjoyed over the years.  The rest of the album is just as delightful, glad I got it."
A277CZ3P20LH74,B00DUUBCJ0,4.0,"Earl Sweatshirt may be aligned with hip hop supergroup Odd Future, but he's doing his damage in markedly different ways from the group's stalwarts. His 2010 mixtape, Earl, may have been heavily influenced by Odd Future's tropes at the time, yet deep down were core ideas that would compose his identity. Now with his major label debut, Doris, he has finally unveiled his first presentation of a full fledged mission statement.On many albums, the beats are subdued so as to give the rapper the chance to take the spotlight. Yet Doris is in a minority of rap albums that actually presents its own distinctive sonic footprint. It goes beyond being simply a rap album, to being a legitimate artistic statement in itself. Much of it is low key and dreamlike, much like Cunninlynguists's 2011 release Oneirology.The Odd Future guest spots, Frank Ocean's included, are confident and capable, but not extraordinary. The philosophy seems to be focused on not attracting attention away from Earl. RZA of Wu Tang Clan fame has a guest spot on \"Molasses,\" but is confined to a spoken word hook. The lone exception being Tyler's is the only one that doesn't tend to fade into the patchwork. But in some way it feels like it is that way by design.Earl lets us see what's on his mind straight off the get go. Problems with family, grandparents, and the general rough and tumble nature of his existence come together to allow Earl to weave very effective poetry. It's not really street poetry, but you can tell Earl has been through some rough environments without making it sound like stereotypical street poetry. Many songs are often esoteric lyrically, but contain lots of snippets of getting in fights, dealing with rough stuff and struggling to make it. On \"Burgundy,\" he showcases his struggle to keep up with the fast paced nature of the music industry while balancing it with family life: \"Grandma's passing/But I'm too busy tryna get this f***** album cracking to see her.\"Later cuts, such as \"Guild\" and \"Whoa\" boast beats that sound a little more sinister and Odd Future like. \"Guild\" sees Mac Miller drop a totally stoned out verse, before allowing Earl to dive into some of the most sinister imagery found on the album. It's an effort not unlike the works of Memphis rapper Cities Aviv, or even Tyler himself.\"Chum\" has some of his most interpersonal lyrics yet, talking about his relationship with his parents and how he looks to Tyler as a big brother figure, while the beat on \"Sunday\" hits with a heavy blast of nostalgia. Frank Ocean lays down a verse on this one, sort of mellow, almost more spoken word than rap, reminiscing and talking about things from past, schools, fights, but it's all done in a very poetic and lyrical way. Both guys prove themselves as great street poets.The other main fact of Earl is that unlike Odd Future cohort Tyler, he doesn't have that powerful of a voice, and lacks a commanding presence. So he tailors his game to work with his strengths, leading Doris to have a very introspective and subdued nature, but still a very effective one."
A2K17XF5VEOR0S,B00DUUBCJ0,5.0,I love this album because it's underground but it has a fresh sound to it. Earl has also increased his skills on the mic. A very impressive album from start to finish. Buy this album Hip Hop heads!
AT5SG6ZYM2ZJM,B00DV9TXAU,5.0,"I just previewed the songs from this CD and ordered it immediately!!  The old Steve Cole who made great CD's like Stay Awhile, Between Us and NY LA is back!!!  After those CD's he fell off.  Can't wait to get it in the mail so I can crank it up and listen to all of the songs fully."
A2X0GI1H23MFUW,B00DVL094C,1.0,"The fact that sickness like this saw the light of day and was released to infect mankind shows the intensive care state of the music industry. From the cover photographer to the audio engineer mixed the album, to the guy that cut the disk on a lathe for pressing, to the truck driver who reflected on the humiliation of having to deliver this cesspool of greed and ego of titanic proportions in order to earn his daily bread. How all these people cursed their life choices and irretrievably lost part of their humanity and dignity in their involvement of this album for a shameful paycheck. Is there no man brave enough to tell this hag to her snout that she is unwanted anywhere near a microphone? That even after 45 years of exploiting John Lennon - 33 of them after his death - she is no closer to being an artist than when she was summarily dumped by her first two husbands for being a psycho-job? Are museums and art authorities so hard up for money that they'll prostitue themselves and their organizations in order to add That Cursed Name to their lists of clients? I need money as much as anyone else, but even if Adolf Hitler paid me billions, I would not do anything to help a Nazi. It is sad to see how many Beatle fans have found refuge in this sewer with the rest of the rats."
A2XLAJEPT9DPYY,B00DVL094C,5.0,"I adore this album! It never ceases to amaze me how Yoko can manage to find new forms of music into which she can inject her ideas. As a matter of fact, she seems to specialize in working with forms not necessarily associated with deep thoughts. Who but her would think to combine conceptual art and dance music? While I don't mean to suggest that no other artist has ever put an idea of importance to a dance beat, Yoko really takes it to a new level!Further, this album makes use of a variety of styles of music, something that is not so common these days. Instead of the same thing from beginning to end, one song you get a ballad and the next you are boogieing to some heart thumping beats! I love the humor and the occasional giggles. The music rocks hard at times and almost whispers other times. It has a consistent spacey feel that works both as a club sound and as relaxing chill to which you can imagine beautiful things.I must also add that Yoko gives class to aging. If you've still got it, there's no reason to stop! I hope that she inspires others to keep going and making being an elder woman cool! She provides wisdom both in her lyrics and music. Her current sound connects past, present, and future into an eye and mind opening experience!"
A1UTSXSKUYOWLN,B00DVL094C,5.0,"Let's all face it, Yoko is not one of those singer/songwriter artists that people would probably have listed in their top 10 of favorites, but these 1 star reviewers lead me to believe that the listeners either aren't a fan of Yoko to begin with, or they haven't listened to this particular cd enough to give it a fair review. I'll admit that she's not in my top 10 list of favorites either, but i have collected her entire catologue over the years and she does have a few albums that i really enjoy listening to. When this album was released, i hesitated to purchase it because i definitely am not a fan of her recent albums such as \"Yes I'm A Witch\", \"Rising\", \"Between my head and the Sky\"...so i figured judging by those particular albums, this would rank right up there with them. Boy, was i wrong. I usually have to listen to an album several times before i can actually give it a fair rating, but seriously, i absolutely loved this one on the first listen. You get a little of everything here. Spoken poetry, mellow, dance, pop...it's just a fantastic album from start to finish and i've thoroughly enjoyed it since i purchased it. I do enjoy some of her earlier work also such as \"Feeling the Space\", \"Season Of Glass\", \"Approximately Infinite Universe\", \"Blueprint For A Sunrise\", plus her singles \"Walking on thin Ice\" and \"My Man\"and now this one is right up there with them!! If you enjoy any of those that i've listed as my favorites, then i think you will definitely enjoy this one as well. For a lady that is now 80 years old, i definitely did not expect a little treasure like this...love it. And if her future releases are as good as this one, bring them on!! Hope this helps with the customers decision."
A3OOPRYGY7XG06,B00DVL094C,4.0,"I own all her stuff. She is great. Not all of her stuff is of the same musical quality. Some of it is art on cd---like her three albums with John (not my favorite stuff). Others are straight forward in your face feminism with solid music ( great stuff). Some of it is heartfelt and painful (good stuff). There is the more recent dance stuff (nice to get lost in). The last two cd's are attempts to bring back the mood of the Ono Band from the early days. I prefer Between My Head and the Sky. However, Take Me to the Land of Hell has its moments. On guitar for both cd's is Sean, and he plays in his father's Ono Band fashion on multiple songs. If you enjoy Yoko, buy it. If you are just curious, start with a different cd. If you don't like her stuff, then skip it."
A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00DVL094C,4.0,"I enjoyed Yoko's new album, though it took a second listen to finally \"get it.\"  The album contains songs in a wide variety of styles, and features Yoko's singing, trademark wailing, several spoken-word pieces, and 15 seconds of silence at the end (\"Hawk's Call\").  My favorite tracks are the title track, \"Bad Dancer,\" \"Little Boy Blue,\" \"There's No Goodbye,\" \"N.Y. Noodle Town,\"  \"Watching The Dawn,\" \"Shine, Shine,\" and the vaudeville-style \"Leaving Tim.\"  The album's chief weakness is that the arrangements are too monotonous; some additional orchestration would have helped, especially on the ballads.While I don't always agree with Yoko's worldview, and find some of her activities a little strange, it's amazing how much energy she has at age 80 - well past retirement age for most folks.  My hat's off to her (and no, for the umpteenth time, she did NOT break up The Beatles).  While Yoko's music is definitely an acquired taste, and is clearly not for everyone, this CD is a \"must-have\" for Yoko fans."
A1KYXIBRJS2JE9,B00DVPN0Q2,4.0,Man this young brother here is doing his thing! I got on him late but I are really happy with this music. Real music from a real dude that has been through some stuff in life! Much respect!!
A3HPJY50EVECAD,B00DVPN2BK,5.0,Just delving into Old timey and bluegrass sound recently and this fulfills me.  I am just a beginner when it comes to this type of music but I like it and my baby dances every time its on.  She also does the Hokey Pokey so her taste are like mine.
A1CRVEOLYIZODJ,B00DVT55K2,5.0,"The simplicity, straight-fowardness and depth of this raw sound defies gravity. Always has always will. After 7 decades of swamp life, this Fox still knowns how to hunt down some outstanding lyrics and lines to remember for anyone who hears this. I hope plenty of people hear it. Unfortunately, this kind of unspoiled sound has become all but too hard to find..."
A1R1J0WMZ3NAEC,B00DVT55K2,3.0,Bought this with LIve From Austin TX cd.  I wanted to have some Tony White in my collection.  This cd is fair but if your going to make a choice get the much better Live From Austin cd.
A3TWT2MUN58OTE,B00DVT55K2,5.0,"I must admit, not such a big fan of his earlier work, but this set is just perfect!To say it's a cross between JJ Cale and RL Burnside, would be unfair because TJW certainly has his own distinct soundIt's minimalistic, and his blues in E is just, well superb...Minimalistic. Yes. That's how it is. But the feeling it evokes, well, you just got to find out for yourself.If I said it's worth a $10 download, that wouldn't be doing the album justiceOn the other hand, you be crazy not to spend this amount on an album you'll be playing over and overand overWell done TJW, let's have another"
A18DHUYFRVFOKD,B00DW1WR14,2.0,"The first two tracks \"Get Away\" and \"Mind Your Manners\" have a little bit of punky grunge energy to them, but the rest of this album is very dull and uninterestings.First of all Eddie's voice is very annoying because it sounds like a cross between Scott Stap and Dave Matthews, not a good sign. Then again i never cared much for Eddie Vedder's singing, plus all the songs sound like Creed B-Sides. When you start ripping off the band the cloned you're sound that's always a bad sign.Bottom line: Most of the songs are uninteresting and lifeless, they just sound bored. Maybe it's cause these guy's are starting to age."
ABODD485UR9G6,B00DW1WR14,4.0,"Some of these songs ROCK!  And some of them are soft and make me tear-up.  &#34;Future Days&#34; makes me want to be a better man and enjoy my days with my wife.  Ditto for &#34;Sirens.&#34;A little preachy at times with their &#34;save the Earth&#34; themes and politics.  I'm still waiting for their anti-Obama album like the Bush hit-piece they did.  Waiting...  Same for Green Day, for that matter.  And waiting for their song about the IPCC and their manipulation of climate data to help their global governance cause.  I guess big government is okay if you have the money and connections to pay to avoid all of the taxes and regulations.  Bono heard me, didn't he?  If you have 'principals&#34;, guys, how do you figure we are better off now?  It's easy to preach when flying high in private jets.But politics aside, this album is a very good one for PJ and Vedder.I look forward to them getting in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, however uncomfortable that may make the guys in PJ."
A1QR9CS347XKFC,B00DW1WR14,5.0,"Like a lightning bolt, this hits and branches out in multiple directions. Pearl Jam cover a little bit of everything that brought them to where they are today in this album. In fact, the first 2 singles summarize the paths taken on Lightning Bolt. Mind Your Manners is a nod to the punk-y, hard rock feel of yesteryear, noticeably sounding like Spin the Black Circle, and is very good in that regard. Sirens follows the ballad driven template of Daughter and Better Man. Lightning Bolt really splits into 2 separate albums. The first 6 songs are mostly up tempo hard charging rockers. And the remainder is lighter, and more ponderous. And, dare I say, beautiful. Yes, beautiful. For me, the best string of songs Pearl Jam have put together since Vs. comes on the second half of this album.This is a great follow-up to the decent Backspacer, which in my opinion had low replay value. I've highly enjoyed this album, and would recommend it to old and new Pearl Jam fans. It's the best they've done since the '90s."
A11CNMRZY4BHDT,B00DW1WR14,4.0,"My expectations for Lightning Bolt were very high with the early release of \"Mind Your Manners\" and \"Sirens\" which are two of the better songs that I have heard from Pearl Jam in a while.  However, I believe those are two of the strongest tracks on the cd.  The cd is very diverse with a wide range of music which I really enjoy.  I wish there were more fast/high tempo quality songs like \"Mind Your Manners\".  I believe the top tracks are the slower/acoustic songs like \"Sirens\", \"Pendulum\", \"Yellow Moon\", and \"Future Days\".  In all, I believe half of the songs are very good and the rest are good but I don't believe there is a bad track on the cd.  Solid effort."
A1KFCW9FZOTBW0,B00DW1WR14,2.0,"I've only hears the LP version, and it's a good cut and good pressing (although I had to return the first one because it was a defective pressing). I thought the instrumental was well done (except as always, Matt Cameron plays TOO FAST. He should have been a punk drummer). Some great new sounds that you wouldn't expect to hear from them. Sounds like good, high-speed analog. Engineering was very well done too. All that's not an insignificant part, but that's where the good ends.This LP really shows Eddie has risen to the level of god-in-his-own-mind. The lyrics are pretty much about Eddie's personal beliefs about what he doesn't believe, and that's what makes the record terrible. All he really says on the whole record is that \"Anyone that doesn't think and beleive exactly what I do is an idiot, and fool\". He basically wastes the whole record saying that \"religion is stupid because it doesn't let anyone think for themsleves, and it's wrong anyway\". He speaks from a position of self-appointed authority, and yet is so ignorant that he doesn't even know that the word means. It's pathetic, really.(ok, here are my beliefs...touche)I'm vehemently against cencorship. On First Amendment grounds, I've got no objections at all. He should always be free to say whatever he wants to whomever he wants at any time. We weren't given the First Amendment to talk about the weather. However, many of his points are so incredibly ignorant that it was just a buzzkill. Artistically, I would have really expected something more at this point. Look at the artwork. Look how Christianity is portrayed. Would it be tolerated to have negative imagery of Islam or Judaism? It's a commentary on our times too. I don't believe in leprechauns, but I don't waste an entire work of art talking about that. I would still defend his right to portray these things, but again, why would he waste an entire work of art on this?! What-else-you-got?Even if one were to agree with his positions and ideas, would one want to listen an ENTIRE record about that? Might have been better if he wrote it from the position of \"this is what I believe\" rather than \"this is what I don't believe\"."
A32U92EN4BCDWU,B00DW1WR14,5.0,A near &#34;10&#34;. Their best in the past 10+ years.
A3PCVAV0BKUCQZ,B00DW1WR14,5.0,"Ever since i heard the first track off of Ten, I have been a HUGE Pearl Jam fan.  They have easily become my favorite band and I consider them the closest thing us 30+ year olds have to a Led Zeppelin.  As much as it pains me to say, the past several PJ albums have been disappointing to me.  Then having to wait 5 years for new music was adding salt on the wound but it is all better now.  This album is amazing and has me excited to see them live again!!!  It is by far their best release since Yield and I highly recommend getting it.One thing you will notice on this album is that Eddie's voice has never sounded better.  Even the lyrics are top notch from start to finish.  It starts off strong with \"Getaway\" and \"Mind Your Manners\".  All Jeff Ament fans are going to love the bass in \"Father's Son\".  The song \"Sirens\" is a beautiful power ballad and it gets stuck in your head so easily.  \"Lightning Bolt\" is an instant classic and can easily be the best song on the album.  Another standout is the old school rock vibe of \"Let the Records Play\".  Aside from these rocking songs, there are 3 other slower songs that are just as enjoyable: \"Infallible\", \"Pendulum\", and \"Yellow Moon\".  My only complaint about the album is the song, \"Sleeping by myself\", which is just a rehashed song from Eddie's Ukulele album.  It is awful and doesn't belong here."
A3NE9N334ZCT7B,B00DW1WR14,3.0,"5 stars because this is a Pearl Jam album. 3 stars because I have heard it all before. PJ is showing their age and have settled into a comfortable predictable existence. I am surprised how many say that PJ is stretching out and their style is evolving yet most reviewers site each song as sounding like a song on past PJ albums. To me this is a problem. Did Quadrophenia sound like Tommy or Who's next for that matter? NO. They were unique works of art as was Dark Side of the Moon to Wish You Were Here to The Wall. PJ's last decade of work is interchangeable, mundane, and predictable. I still like it because I am a fan, but the catalog is not strengthened by this entry. The one song many reviewers site as being a great song and one of the albums best in Infallible- to me this is PJ doing their best Maroon 5 imitation (if you don't believe me, listen again with an open mind) just as Dirty Frank was PJ doing their take on the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The artwork of the preacher at the pulpit in front of the dunce cap wearing congregation (of 2) is PJ's commentary on religion but ironically it is Eddie Vedder in front of mindless PJ followers who love everything they put out. I think a true sign that this is less than a classic (as some call it) is I don't see anyone ever covering anything on this (or anything in the last decade for that matter) as a tribute to its greatness."
A2FFOPBF820WXZ,B00DW1WR14,2.0,"Well another 4 year wait for a Pearl Jam album and yet another disappointment.There is some okay tracks on this album but overall its the same old stuff they have been churning out since Riot Act.Mind your manners, Fathers Son and Getaway may remind you of songs from Yield and Vitalogy but they still don't improve the album much, you have heard it all before.Sirens is another ballad much like Parachutes or Just Breathe which are probably the two worst styles of Pearl Jam songs around.To be honest, this is a disappointment. If they can release an album in 2014 thats as good as Versus or Vitalogy with a bit of experimentation (for a change) I might just forgive them.Out of 10, I'd give it a 6."
A1ORBTOV5HUOMN,B00DW1WR14,2.0,"mmm.This album is like a cross between Vitalogy, Yield and the 2006 Self titled album.In otherwords - awful.The only song I found remotely interesting and enjoyable was &#34;Fathers Son&#34; the first interesting and original thing Pearl Jam have written since at least 2002 or 2000.The rest is forgettable nonsense.Its like they are having a midlife crisis or something and trying to relive their popular success in the mid 90s, but also want to be a country band at the same time.In other words, not good enough.This record is only slightly better than Backspacer and the 2006 record. Probably not better than Riot Act though.I really don't know what to say, I am still in shock.I just wish they'd write a decent song for their fans, that's if they have any sensible fans anymore."
A16MZL9N052I38,B00DW1WR14,4.0,"I started listening to Pearl Jam with their first album. With some on and off, I've been listening ever since. Was that really more than 20 years ago?'Lightning Bolt' is a strong effort. Whether it's 'one of their strongest' is music-critic type of discussion that always strikes me as a bit silly. Different albums relate to different times and places a group finds itself.The title track has an excellent guitar groove, the drums build up, Eddie's vocal is right in the pocket, the lyrics are tight, the whole band smashes into the chorus with modal chord changes (not bluesy, not classic rock, metal, just...Pearl Jam) ....what's not to like. 'Sirens' is a simply beautiful song, 'Swallowed Hole' suggests why there should be more 12-string electric in music these days, 'Sleeping by Myself' reminds me of a track from Eddie's solo ukelele album though this one is acoustic guitar, and 'Future Days' is a song that only adults could write, with Beatles-like harmonies and a nice violin tracking the main riff. That Pearl Jam uses a violin when it complements the song signals their musicianship. It sounds totally right in the song.Nicely done. Congrats on more than 20 years of solid music."
A1BQD9YQ161D3L,B00DW473E2,2.0,"If you've been waiting 5 years looking for the new Decyfer Down album don't bother looking here. Gone are the monster heavy guitars and killer melodic hooks of one of my favorite rock bands. Replaced by Alice in Chains meets Black Crows meets Sound Garden style tunes. Which I don't mind, but if I want them I will buy them. Sadly, other than a couple of tell tale vocals and a good bridge or chorus on track's 6 & 10, you would never know this was a D. Down record. I hate when bands either start copying their influences or just put a record out to fulfill an obligation with their record company. Don't know if that's true here, but sorry DD, I love ya, but I do not like this record.  Just one guy's opinion."
A3VE41DKP1H06C,B00DW473E2,2.0,"This album has nothing to do with previous Decyfer DownI waited long for this new CD to arrive and I am somehow disappointed, personally and respectfully I don't like it at allHope they can on the future go back to previous rock styleKeep it going Decyfer, I know you have talented musicians on your band and can something else.God bless"
A2O57LB3BP3WTS,B00DW473E2,5.0,"DECYFER DOWN has basically been indolent for the past four years. After releasing CRASH, which was a good follow-up to an amazing debut album, DECYFER DOWN fell off the face of the earth, while a new album seemed too far away. And now, the wait has culminated with SCARECROW, which shows the band heading in a different direction than previous while still obtaining their signature sound, and for the most part, it works really well for the band. The first two albums were both typical hard rock albums that were very similar to ALTER BRIDGE, while this new one seems to be alluding to 90's grunge bands such as SOUNDGARDEN (without the crazy time signatures), ALICE IN CHAINS, and even a dash of AC/DC thrown in the mix. Songs such as first single FIGHT TO WIN, MEMORY, WESTBORO, and well-written worship closer SO IN LOVE are all instant hits that showcase this sound. Also, TJ Harris, the lead vocalist, does as good a job as Caleb Oliver did on the band's first album, END OF GREY, and Harris' voice compliments the band very well. Overall, SCARECROW may not be one of the year's shining highlights, but it still is an improvement over CRASH, and is proof that Christian rock can be easily accessible to any rock fan.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"
A20I0NB4BRHATQ,B00DW5ILK6,5.0,"Boz is my favorite number musician. I have all of his releases on cd. I also have some old 8 tracks, cassettes and vinyl. Keep up the good work, Bill and I'll keep enjoying."
A204G7E13UW2B0,B00DW5IM9Q,5.0,"So sings Dylan in a beautiful solo piano version of When I Paint My Masterpiece that closes out this collection.And so it is. The haunting, unadorned and authentic work that appears on Another Self Portrait certainly seems like a masterpiece as over and against what was actually released in 1970.Dylan's unfortunate later penchant for not releasing some of his best work (think Blind Willie McTell and Foot of Pride from Infidels) seems to have gotten underway at this time. In this sense, Greil Marcus inadvertently had it right in asking, \"What is this ____t?\" in the famous 1970 Rolling Stone review of the original Self Portrait. The release at that time of the honest, unadorned traditional songs that we now hear for the first time would have been a tour de force. Better late than never...Anyway, setting revisionism aside, let's look at this current and excellent release.Of the 35 tracks, the majority are from the Self Portrait sessions. These include versions of songs that were released, heard here without the often ill advised overdubbing, as well as a number of other songs in a similar spare style that should have been released, but were not. Apart from the Self Portrait material, there's some great stuff from the New Morning sessions later in 1970. In addition, there are several alternate versions of Nashville Skyline content, a couple of great live recordings from the Isle of Wight, and a smattering of other work from the 1967 - 1971 period.Here are a few of my favorite cuts:Went to See the Gypsy - The demo version with just Dylan and David Bromberg on guitar is faraway, haunting, and wistful. It sounds true to the lyric in a way that the urgent delivery of the released version misses almost entirely.Pretty Saro - While Bob is known for many things, I've always felt he was at his best singing love songs. This one is astonishing; a mellifluous and lyric expression of lovesick longing. Anyone who says that Dylan can't sing should listen to this. His voice here manages to express something that is almost inexpressible.These Hands - Johnny Cash covered this great Eddie Noack number; why didn't Bob's beautiful version make it onto Self Portrait?Working on a Guru - A hard driving 12 bar blues with - in a sublime irony - George Harrison delivering guitar riffs sounding more like Mike Bloomfield than the Maharishi following former Beatle. Dylan calls out, \"Play it one time\", and then, obviously having a whale of a good time, \"Play it again\". Harrison laughs a lays down an additional series of hot licks.Copper Kettle - Stripped of the syrupy orchestral and choral overdubs this song is a revelation. There's a raw power here, almost completely absent in the original. As Dylan sings \"Don't use no green or rotten wood. It'll get you by the smoke\" he emits a guttural growl that'll make your hair stand on end.I know I'm going to be listening to Another Self Portrait a lot. It's that good..."
A2REQUI85URT87,B00DW5IM9Q,5.0,"Like the original Self-Portrait, Another Self-Portrait has many songs that will never rate high in the Dylan canon, including a lot of covers that are interesting largely because Dylan clearly considered them influences on his own work. The same cannot be said, IMHO, for the outtakes/alternative versions of several of the stellar Dylan compositions on New Morning, such as Sign on a Window, Time Passes Slowly, and the demo of I Went to See the Gypsy. Like the alternative versions from the NY sessions of Blood on the Tracks, these performances rank at the same high level as the \"official\" releases, and give new insights into the emotions, and genius, from which they sprang. It is wonderful that these compositions have now been given a chance to live and breathe in the world, with the others. For me that makes the album well worth having, even at a two-disc price. More casual Dylan fans, however,  might still do better to focus on acquiring other Dylan albums that are clearly more essential to the canon."
A184A7TYY9SKX,B00DW5IM9Q,5.0,"Dylan toured extensively up through 1966, was on TV in 1968, then toured heavily from 1974 on. However, from 1969 - 72, his Bob-ness was a bit of an invisible man, hiding out in Woodstock & in Greenwich Village. So this CD set opens up the door on a vague phase in Dylan's career: post-country, but pre-stadium tours. Clearly, he is getting back in touch with his roots in folk, blues, country, & storytelling.I would like to play this CD for every person who's ever said: \"Dylan's a good songwriter but can't sing.\" This collection may include his best singing--EVER! He's not copying Woody Guthrie, he's not stretching out every p-h-r-a-s-e, & for the majority of songs, he's emerging from the Nashville Skyline somewhat mannered & controlled voice to sing with passion, power, range (yes, incredible range), expressionism, soul, and even--cough, cough--technique! If you've been puzzled in the last 20 years by the curious, distant, crotchety man who tours relentlessly, has almost zero interaction w/ his audience, and sings like he's gargling gravel, then this collection will be a revelation!Okay, yes there are 1 or 2 duds (Minstrel Boy sounds like it was scraped off the basement floor, not the basement tapes), but I made my own comp CD of my favorite 80 minutes out of the two CD's & 115 total minutes. Let me tell you, they are 80 of the highest-quality Dylan minutes ever. If any of these young, bearded, twenty-something, neo-folk bands heard this, they would burst into tears, give up music, and go into aluminum siding or sell insurance. That's how good ASP is. That's how good Dylan was then. Just listen to Went to See the Gypsy, Pretty Saro, Spanish is the Loving Tongue, Time Passes Slowly, Thirsty Boots, This Evening So Soon, Copper Kettle, Tattle O' Day, among many others."
A3AICCCK8VX8Y1,B00DW5IM9Q,5.0,"Although many critics dismissed Bob Dylan's 1970 album Self Portrait when it first appeared, this set here features the missing pieces to the puzzle it makes up. The earliest selection outside this latest Bootleg Series' time frame is a recording of Minstrel Boy from 1967's Basement Tapes which serves more of a sketch piece than its' actual performance piece as part of the infamous Isle Of Wight performance two years hence with the Band[Originally the Hawks, then as The Crackers around the BT period]. Mostly we get a bare-bones sketch of half of SP as well as outtakes and alternate versions of Nashville Skyline and New Morning recordings. On the latter one, though, we get overdubbed versions of some tracks including the title cut of NM which gives Dylan a Stax-sounding feel to it. The stripped-down version of All The Tired Horses is actually refreshing as opposed to the orchestrated one that opened SP. The demo version of When I Paint My Masterpiece is in its' most honest form of reading. This collection here is the best of Dylan's country phase. But the real treat here on this deluxe edition is the Isle Of Wight show of Dylan and The Band.Truly a must! Get it while you can and enjoy it!"
A332D1D6Q865XJ,B00DW5IM9Q,1.0,Some things are never meant to be released.  Even when your name is Bob Dylan.  Nothing more than another cash grab.
A3G6FW8KWUMBB1,B00DW5IM9Q,5.0,very good love this time in Bobs career  Dylan close to his best to have these gems after so long is great nice package
A3DPACNQCR3720,B00DW5IM9Q,4.0,"Finances and the economy being what it is, I went w/the 2 disc set.  Actually, I haven't even received it yet, but just spent the past two hours listening to it on line (thanks Amazon) and it is a hypnotic blend.  Comprised of 10 alternate/outtakes each from Self Portrait and 10 from New Morning, it also includes 7 tracks from the original SP album, minus the overdubs.  Rounding out the set is one outtake from the basement Tapes, 2 cuts from the Isle of Wight concert, 2 demos, 2 alternate tracks from Nashville Skyline, an outtake from Greatest Hits Vol 2....carry the 2, yep, 35 tracks!I also wonder why some of the SP outtakes were left off.  There are at least 4 of these that have become instant classics to me.  The Material from New Morning gives the original album a backbone.  Some very surprising, and beautiful, orchestration as well.  You will be surprised.Regrading the full Isle of Wight concert-I haven't listened to the whole concert yet, But from what I've heard, I'll stick with Before the Flood.Whichever version you buy, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  And Why Not?  It's Dylan!"
A2TTZ3ASYJPO2G,B00DW7IVSG,2.0,"I was so excited for this cd to come out.  Then i listened to it... Who is this??  No New Orleans vibe at all.  No funky party songs like on For True.  Its mostly lame R&B.  First song is good.  Then its all down hill.  What a waste of a great band.  Leave the R&B crap for the pretenders.  Like someone else stated,  its background music...at best."
A7R5MG7X15Q7E,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"I truly love Keith Urban!  He is a fabulous artist, easy on the eyes and love to hear him talk.  You can't beat an Aussie!  Can't wait to watch America's Got Talent just to see Keith.  I own every cd that he has made and seen him live 5 times and I never get tired of him."
A29IE483D5HY5R,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"Good album overall, definitely enjoy listening to Keith and we like the majority of the songs.  Not sure this is much different from his past albums as we heard this would be but like it nevertheless and would recommend."
A1ULU7Z62E2I6O,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"First of all, do yourself a favor and order the deluxe version...it has four different songs (doesn't include She's an 11).  I think my wife and I have played this album at least 20 times...it's mostly up-tempo songs that really get us going.  Beyond that, this could be Keith's best album yet.  We saw him at Red Rocks on 31 Aug and were hoping he'd play more tunes from Fuse (he played Even the Stars Fall 4 U and A Little Bit of Everything).  There are quite a few potential singles from it...some of our favorites include \"Cop Car\", \"Shame (on me)\", \"Come Back to Me\", \"Raise \"Em Up\" and \"Black Leather Jacket\" (only on deluxe version).  If you saw Keith judge on American Idol, you saw his vast knowledge of music from many genres.  This album is a testament to it."
AQDI3OT7LW6VS,B00DW7IVZY,4.0,Keith has a great cd here.  It's feel good music that is good listening while driving down the highway.  If you like country....you'll like this cd.
A76KAUQZXK859,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"Another CD purchased for the wife.  She absolutely loved this CD.....she said just what puts Keith Urban near the top ratings.  I agree with her, it is a good CD."
A2KILNYE6LV4Y2,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"Keith just keeps getting better with every new release. A lot of new ways he goes with this one,different sounds and style."
A29PJ2L6HGUR4H,B00DW7IVZY,5.0,"Keith Urban is off to a great start after 3 long years of not releasing an album! Fuse his seventh studio album is a masterpiece!1. Somewhere In My Car- is an up tempo song and a great start to the album. It has a laid back melody to start off the track but builds throughout the song to a fast paced almost rock sounding song.2. Even The Stars Fall 4 U- is another fast paced song. With lyrics like ''girl you can't tell me that you can't see the kind of spell you put on me'' Keith leaves the mental imagery to the listener to decide hinting only that she is a truly beautiful girl allowing the listener to depict their own dream girl.3. Cop Car- is one of my favorite tracks on the album, it is a slow romantic song that depicts an almost movie like experience of true love.4. Shame- is a midtempo song. As you might imagine it is about mistakes made by keith. It does a great job of reminding the listener that we're all only human and no one is perfect. Everyone can relate to this song since no one is perfect.5. Good Thing- is an upbeat mid tempo song. It's a good song to get you dancing and i can't wait to hear it at concert.6. We Were Us (duet with Miranda Lambert)- is an upbeat song, Keith and Miranda's vocals complement each other quite nicely. They blend together a few times in this song and really just confirms that this will not be their last duet.7. Love's Poster Child- the 100% country song we've all been waiting for! Love's Poster Child has Dixie in the heart of it.8. She's My 11- is a fast paced upbeat song. Sure to be a hit at concert aswell as the charts.9. Come Back To Me- a slower song bringing you a tale of heartbreak. It made me think back to my own tale of heartache and break.10. Red Camaro- a fast paced song. It has a unique background sound.11. Little Bit of Everything- one of the best tracks on the album. It is an upbeat mid tempo song. Sure to put a smile on your face it is a cheery song perfect for lightening the mode and relaxing to.12. Raise 'Em Up (featuring Eric Church)- the best track on the album hands down! Two great artist's contributing equally to this song makes it a masterpiece! It is about God, Family, and Patriotism 3 key components to any country song.13. Heart Like Mine- starts off slow but builds to a fast paced song. There is so much change that it could almost be divided into two songs. One slow and depressing, the other hope inspiring.Recommendation- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to any country lovers or Keith fans! The tracks not only hold up on their own, they also blend together to form a truly great album!The deluxe album comes with an additional 3 tracks1. Black Leather Jacket- a good song that gives you a sense of Keith's past and high school days.2. Gonna B Good- a fast paced upbeat song.3. Lucky Charm- a fast paced song about Keith's girl."
A39K9GDTIZ0933,B00DWFQ2N4,3.0,"I'll be honest and admit that I was really hesitant to pick up this second volume of The 20/20 Experience, because I found the first one to be a total snoozefest. I almost hate to put it so crudely because I don't want to diminish the fact that Justin Timberlake truly is a talented guy and a real artist in every sense of the word, but being comprised mostly of overly long, drab, meandering, melody-less tracks, it seemed more like a personal pet project or spur of the moment studio jam session rather than anything meant for mass consumption. Obviously I'm all for artists who think outside the box and don't cave in to mainstream conventions, but the finished product was almost TOO abstract, in my opinion, and the disconnect between artist and audience was just too obtrusive to get over. After hearing this new disc's first single, Take Back the Night, I thought perhaps he might be headed in a more upbeat, poppy direction this time around and was curious enough to buy the whole album. After several listens I can definitively place Part 2 ahead of Part 1 in nearly every way, there's no question about that, though it's not perfect, and certainly isn't without its fair share of weaker moments.The disc opens with Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want), which is a fairly straightforward dance track which nicely blends futuristic techno effects with old school R&B; beats. I get kind of a sweaty, steamy, jungle vibe from this one, and another reviewer nailed it when they said the opening bars sound like a Queen song. The party continues with True Blood, which is sort of a sexy Thriller for a new age - I believe it even samples the same Vincent Price maniacal laughter - and is definitely shaping up to be an early favorite. And just in time for Halloween, too! I'm sure the nearly 10-minute running time will cause many to pass this gem over completely, but it really is their loss. Drink You Away is a decent song that shows Timberlake venturing into folksy Johnny Cash-like territory, with admirable results. Cabaret's instrumentation struck me as too clunky to really be enjoyable, and I was never a fan of Drake's voice even on the best of days, so him popping up here certainly doesn't help matters. Amnesia and TKO didn't leave an impression on me one way or the other, and Murder could have been more interesting had it not sold itself out with yet another interchangeable guest rapper interlude. The album closes with Not a Bad Thing, a midtempo ballad that wouldn't be entirely out of place on one of Nsync's latter CDs. (I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing, lol.) The subsequent hidden bonus track, which I believe is called Pair of Wings, is a touching, low-key acoustic affair that is absolutely phenomenal and may be worth the price of admission alone. I honestly wasn't impressed with either of the red bullseye retailer's exclusive bonus tracks, Blindness and Electric Lady. They're a bit dull for my taste and never really seem to get off the ground, but a collector should be glad to have them nevertheless.As you can see, Part 2 of The 20/20 Experience is a varied album that strives to offer up a little something for everyone, which already puts it at an advantage over Part 1 where nearly every song sounded virtually identical. True, it's a bit of a hodgepodge and perhaps less cohesive thematically than Part 1, but I found many of the individual tracks to be much more enjoyable in and of themselves. (Another reviewer compared this to Prince's \"The B-sides,\" which is about accurate.) In short, what's good is REALLY good, but you'll have to wade through some filler to get to it. In fairness, there's very little that I would actually call bad, so I figure a middle-of-the-road three star rating is appropriate. At times Timberlake seems a little in over his head with these \"high concept\" albums, and perhaps is trying too hard to consciously set himself apart from the pack when these types of artistic progressions need to just happen naturally, but I respect what he's trying to do here and the fact that he actually evolves. I admit part of me is still fond of his older bubblegum pop days, but I have a feeling he's way beyond that now and we'll just have to wait and see what he offers up next."
A1D6HK21UH1163,B00DWFQ2N4,5.0,"In my opinion part 2 is way better than part 1. I like the beats, there more up tempo and it's more \"poppy\" than the first. I have listened straight threw no skipping tracks at least 5 times now and I love it."
A1U0CX4OIKSXVL,B00DWFQ4NW,5.0,I love this album.This is what real hardcore sounds like.Thank you Touche Amore and Deathwish with another fantastic release.
A26GHK666ZGXTS,B00DWOUYCU,5.0,this cd is full of classic christmas music!  it's a wonderful addition to my christmas album collection.  i will enjoy it for years to come!
A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00DWOUYCU,5.0,"Andy Williams (born Howard Andrew &#34;Andy&#34; Williams, December 3, 1927 &#8211; September 25, 2012) was a fantastic singer and all around entertainer who enjoyed great success simply because he was so special! Andy could take just about anything, any song or ballad, and make it fresh and new with his very classy interpretations and a voice that was remarkably easy on the ear and stayed beautiful to hear throughout the decades. Although we sadly lost Andy last year he lives on through his contributions to the arts including albums like this one; this Christmas CD is terrific and very highly recommended both for his fans and newcomers just discovering his superlative talent. I also like the mixture of secular and sacred music on this album.There isn&#8217;t a bad track in the lot here; everything is just that good! &#8220;Joy to the World&#8221; features a lovely choir singing with Andy and it all holds its own very well. &#8220;Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!&#8221; is very pretty and listen for yet another gem in Andy&#8217;s stunning rendition of &#8220;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).&#8221; The lush musical arrangement for this number, as is the case with all the songs and ballads here, really enhances this exquisite melody.&#8220;Winter Wonderland&#8221; charms me with its beauty and &#8220;Silent Night, Holy Night&#8221; couldn&#8217;t have been done any better than the way Andy delivers it here! The children&#8217;s choir is also quite good. &#8220;O Little Town of Bethlehem&#8221; is beautiful and I also really like &#8220;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&#8221; a number Judy Garland first sang in the MGM movie &#8220;Meet Me in St. Louis.&#8221; &#8220;The Little Drummer Boy&#8221; is also nicely done and &#8220;What Child Is This?&#8221; has Andy singing once more at his usual very best.&#8220;Silver Bells&#8221; is another charmer and &#8220;Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells&#8221; is dynamic with Andy handling those tempo and key changes like the pro he always was and will remain! The chorus is great, too. &#8220;Angels We Have Heard on High&#8221; is one of my favorite numbers on the album because it&#8217;s so inspirational and &#8220;My Favorite Things,&#8221; which I first heard performed by Julie Andrews in &#8220;The Sound of Music,&#8221; is faultlessly done. &#8220;O Holy Night&#8221; is classic and the album ends with Andy Williams singing his heart out on &#8220;Ave Maria&#8221; and &#8220;It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year.&#8221;Andy Williams&#8217; &#8220;The Classic Christmas Album&#8221; is one of my favorites ever; this is a must-have for his fans and anyone who appreciates high quality control Christmastime music."
ALGOVQB5ECSB0,B00DWOUYCU,5.0,Andy Williams has always been one of my top recording artist.  I love his songs.  I grew up listening to his music.
A1CQTU9YHFMBZ9,B00DWOUYCU,5.0,Best AW Christmas album bar none. A 'must have' in every collection. Contains the essential Williams holiday songs and is very uplifting this time of the year.
A225JBX8MUO9Y6,B00DWOUZUQ,5.0,If you love Johnny Cash you have to have this one. I  Love that it came with  amazon cloud too.
ANEEUPHQNHJJV,B00DX56242,5.0,"This is one of Bob Baldwin's tight, well-phrased, funky with a lot of bounce and charm. I would recommend this to a freind."
A88XRNYP9DZNF,B00DX56242,5.0,Bob Baldwin has a style that will lull the listener into a hypnotic trance. He epitomizes the term &#34;smooth jazz&#34; because the music is just that...smooth. This is great background music for an outdoor BBQ  or pool party.
AHJ6WRWKURJ16,B00DX56242,5.0,"Unbelievable. Just when you think he can't get any better. BAM!!! Here he goes pumping out another thumbs up. Bob Baldwin, you have more than earned your props. YOU ARE THE MAN!!!"
ABR7SYOV4EAZS,B00DX5WGTW,1.0,this cd was absolutely garbage it was not all that they hyped it up to be u can barely understand what the hell she saying. a total disappointment. I wish I could get my money back. smh
A19TN7UDB5JNHE,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,I knew that I enjoyed the single of this cd but did not know what to expect with the rest of the album.  I give it a thumb up all the way.  It is a very good cd to enjoy.  I would recommend it if you don't already have it
A3ANO8MT4P12D8,B00DX5WGTW,4.0,"I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised that this is a really good cd. Tamar has a really nice voice who knew that all that loud ratchet .com mess and loud talking there was a truly gifted singer. I have only skimmed thorough a couple songs and I really am enjoying every thing that I am hearing. I could really see myself purchasing another cd if there is another one. All I can say is don't judge this cd by what you see on her tv show, get it, listen to it and judge for yourself, you might be surprised."
A3OARF93D916I3,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,"Tamar has a beautiful voice, you will enjoy this CD.. Lots of hits are on here... Very powerful CD! Enjoy!"
A3HIEOLVIA1KWQ,B00DX5WGTW,3.0,I only like her slow ballads because it showcase her true vocal sounds.  I really don't like her uptempo tracks because it sounded too kiddiesh for my taste.  More like she gearing up for the teen audience.
A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00DX5WGTW,3.0,"Tamar claims she has a man who thinks she's the Prettiest Girl in the world, even when she \"ain't got no make-up on\", but that's hard to believe. He may tell her that in order to taste some of her Hot Sugar, but I doubt he really thinks that and I doubt she really thinks he thinks that. You can see her face on the album photo and the mere fakeness of it suggests she's suffering from a serious self-esteem problem. If that isn't the case, there should be a logical answer as to why she hides her face under so much make-up, alters it with cosmetic surgery and has pictures of it altered with visual effects, and I can't think of what (else) that answer might be.To be fair, my little psychological diagnosis extends far beyond this particular Braxton. She is, in part, a product of her society. So she makes romance albums in which almost every song is about sex or \"Love\" like most other urban pop crooners. Whether you like what you hear when you press play or not; it begins with a sample of a Mtume song and a quote from a rap song that sampled that song too; you have to give her a low score in the category of originality. She does better in voice. I'd rather hear her than her huskier sister Toni. But there's not much happening here in regards to overall talent. The worst songs include Tip Toe and Pieces.marcellee.com"
A1VBTO190CM23S,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,"Great CD! After waiting a while to see the first few videos, I gave in and bought this CD and I was not disappointed! I listen to it frequently! My favorites are &#34;Tip Toe,&#34; &#34;All The Way Home,&#34; &#34;Hot Sugar,&#34; and &#34;Pieces&#34; but the whole cd is AMAZ-BALLS!!! Get this cause She DId That!"
A92F571Y9MTW6,B00DX5WGTW,3.0,"Although singer Tamar Braxton recently released her second album, she is far from being an overnight celebrity. She originally got her start as a member of the sibling group The Braxtons. However, that union proved to be short-lived, as oldest member Toni was signed to LaFace Records just as they were dropped from Arista. Tamar continued on as a background singer for Toni and later rejoined The Braxtons when they signed a deal with Atlantic Records. The only problem was that the quintet was downsized to a trio, as contract issues prevented Toni from getting involved and other sister Traci was pregnant at the time. Tamar, Trina and Towanda resurfaced with their lone album- 1996's \"So Many Ways\", with the title track being a minor hit produced by Jermaine Dupri. Three years later, Tamar signed with DreamWorks Records to release her debut solo album. Once again, she hit a stumbling block when her debut was shelved by the label and she was asked to record new material. In 2000, she released \"Tamar\" which featured the singles \"Get None\" and the ballad \"If You Don't Wanna Love Me\". Despite the high profile list of producers, the album came and went with little fanfare. She then temporarily abandoned her recording career and worked with her sister Toni on her three subsequent albums for the 2000's- \"The Heat\", \"More Than A Woman\" and \"Libra\".When Tamar Braxton did emerge again it was due to a couple of false starts. Contracts with Casablanca and Universal were signed, but yielded very little results. Once again, she abandoned her music career and continued to do session work. In 2011, Toni Braxton starred in the hit reality series \"Braxton Family Values\", in which Tamar became the breakout star of the show. The attention garned her a recording contract where she would release her sophomore effort \"Love And War\". On this new album, she reunites with a couple of old friends- such as Bryan-Michael Cox on the songs \"Pieces\" and \"Where It Hurts\" as well as Tricky Stewart on the song \"Stay And Fight\". Da Internz (best known for their work with Big Sean and Rihanna), produces the secretive themed \"Tip Toe\" as well as the brief \"She Did That\". Tamar tries her hand at rapping on \"Hot Sugar\", while working with producer Diplo (M.I.A., Usher, Brandy) on \"One On One Fun\". She works with the production team The Underdogs, who produce the ballad \"All The Way Home\", which was penned by former RichGirl member Sevyn Streeter and Troop member Steve Russell. Overall, \"Love And War\" is an okay effort from Tamar Braxton. Aside from not having better songs to complement her great voice, another thing hindering this album is her desire to appeal to a much younger audience- as evidenced by roughly half the songs. Tamar could have exercised better judgement in her choice of material, which could have balanced out the schizophrenic nature of her album."
A2VF1YEZB3O76C,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,"I couldn't wait any longer for this album and purchased at 12 midnight. This is album definitely exceeded my expectations.  Love all songs but my standouts are of course Love and War, The One, Stay and Fight, All The Way Home (love this), Pieces, Where It Hurt and White Candle.Her voice is very powerful on this album and it shows.No skipping songs on this album."
A303RTCQ3K1J5O,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,I had the pressure of meeting Tamar before this cd came out.  She is so down to earth and even gave me a hug.  I've been waiting on this cd to come out and I love it!
AHSMPARTQOW3Y,B00DX5WGTW,4.0,"Tamar's over the top personality is annoying and endearing at the same time but her vocal skills are on point.  Reality t.v. was a real plus for her as far as drawing #'s for the album impo.  But upon listening, I will give her props.  She delivered an enjoyable album.  She poured her heart out and enchanted the listener with a variety of songs as she popped it on some songs and sultrily wailed a love song to her mate.  I commend her on the tremendous time and effort put into this project and her tenacity in executing a dynamic cd that defines her independently...no comparison to her big sister.  Yassss... She Did That!!  3.88"
AYAM510D8ESVF,B00DX5WGTW,3.0,"I think this Album is &#34;Average&#34; at best.  Tamar has a GORGEOUS voice, and it's too bad he vocals were drowned out by all the tracks.  Enjoyed the Ballads (because you can actually hear her voice).  Vincent Herbert.....you could have done better than this.  Hopefully, next Album."
AJEZF713ZZJYZ,B00DX5WGTW,4.0,"I like it, almost love it. I wanted a few more bangers than ballads but I can't say I'm disappointed. I'm glad she able to put out this project."
A2EJW9719PPUH2,B00DX5WGTW,5.0,I'm glad to hear Tamar's cd it was a pleasure to hear singing than what other artist is putting out.
A25FRC3BGFQ521,B00DX88EJ0,5.0,there is always something unique in his cds and or should say something different.  love it and will continue to listen
AX2HNQO24BOXL,B00DX88EJ0,5.0,"Nothing else but his name needs to be said.  Great, as usual.  my favorite tune is 'Shower', but, as with the other CDs that will change as time and life goes on."
A3GSULO9NWMFN9,B00DX88EJ0,5.0,Jaheim has  a beautiful voice and I just love him and his music I have not heard anything yet that I don't like
A1HDELFTVZMFFZ,B00DX88EJ0,4.0,THIS CD IS NOT LIKE THE VERY FIRST CD THIS ARTIST MADE BUT IT IS A OK CD. i LIKE Jaheim's music so i am satified with my purchase.
A3GDLR7NRZH32Y,B00DX88EJ0,5.0,"From beginning to end I love this cd. Jaheim is lyrically at his best. I am still listening to \"Another Round\" and \"Appreciation Day\" has joined the rotation. Of the six discs my car has, half of them are Jaheim. I guess I should share that I am a FAN of Jaheim but even so I am objective and I must say that Jaheim gets better and better with each cd. This cd opens with \"Age Ain't A Factor\" which is currently getting lots of radio play in my city but that is just the tip of the iceberg. From track to track Jaheim keeps it real. \"He Don't Exist\" is a song about how women have this ideal man in mind and in actuality no one is perfect.  \"Morning\" is a remake but he totally changed the messaged in his version. I love this song!! Every man needs to listen to \"What She Really Means\" and take notes :). The title track \"P*** Appreciation Day\" is sexy but not vulgar. \"Baby x3\" reminds me of some of his older music. \"Shower Scene\" truly paints a stimulating picture. \"Sexting\" a fun song that anyone in a fun loving relationship can relate to. It brought back memories for me. My favorite song on the entire cd is \"I Found You\", I get weak listening to him sing this song. \"Florida\" is about a couple of seemingly unfair recent events in the U.S. I appreciate Jaheim sharing his feelings about these events. I think it's important to shine a light on injustice in any and every way you can. \"Sticks and Stones\", \"First Time\", and \"Blame Me\" all wonderful songs and continue in the lyrical excellence of this cd. The cd ends with \"Chase Forever\" which is my second favorite on this cd and was a perfect end to this masterpiece of music. For me this cd is two thumbs up, a slam dunk, 5 stars,  the best of the best. Jaheim truly gets better and better. Thanks for sharing your gift."
A260XH35LG0NHH,B00DX88G0C,5.0,"There was one song in the movie that I really liked, so I bought the CD and listened to it for like 3 months straight"
A1R1J0WMZ3NAEC,B00DX88GAW,3.0,"A few songs are memorable but most not.  The real negative is the sound quality, garage band at best.  Too bad.  If the cd was recorded with quality equipment it would have a 4 starr rating."
A6AOLZK82A67C,B00DXP0QV2,5.0,I enjoyed there music for years and this one is his last one he they did. this is for any fan of nirvana.
A2IMM6MUP7ZX0S,B00DXP0QV2,5.0,"When I received the album through the mail, I listened to it immediately. I loved the sound quality. It's louder than the original album, which I liked a lot. I read a lot of reviews about the loudness war, and hear people say they don't like it being louder, but I sure do"
A2TP03R2L7KMVQ,B00DXP0QX0,3.0,"Lyric changes were interesting, but song versions were generally of little difference from earlier releases. No significant value to those who own the originals already."
A1GVDH5OHQJLPI,B00DXP0QX0,5.0,If you are a fan of Rod this a must. It is fun to listen to. You get to hear songs such as Maggie Mae as he is working on it. It is more of an improve cd but as must to listen to and once you do you will buy it.
A2LXCV64APAEHT,B00DXP0QYY,5.0,The George half of this duo is one hell of a producer. His sounds are so clean. He does a lot wth a litt
A1EL05F7CF8IOR,B00DXP0QYY,5.0,"I like ALUNAGEORGE's updated UK pop music - it's a little 80's, a little now, and very on trend.  Her voice has a unique pitch but I do like it.  Hints of Goldfrapp and the XX.Fun melodies and hip-hop sub text but never too much of any one musical style.  Pop music and it's good - highly recommended."
A438P8H3BNF2V,B00DY9X3JO,5.0,"Ever found a piece of music you can't get enough of;you know the one you play over and over and over again?That is exactly what I've found in Dianne ReevesBeautiful Life....OMG!!A fusion of jazz, Latin, rock and neo soulDianne has perfected the quintessential blendMost of the songs are covers and she does each one proud;  Bob Marley's &#34;Waiting in Vain&#34;, Fleetwood Mac's &#34;Dreams&#34;, Marvin Gaye's &#34; I Want You&#34; and the slammin' cover of Ani DiFranco's &#34;32 Flavors&#34;.....Wait ...And then there's the band.  Are you ready?  Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Gregory Porter and Lalah Hathaway vocals.  Pianists Robert Glasper and Gerald Clayton.  Need I say more.  This effort is as good as it gets.  And what's even more exciting....she stays true to herself.  All this talent in one project, how can you possibly go wrong.  One star contributors....that's just mean spirited.  Brilliant effort....fills my home gorgeous music , real vocal talent.This one does not disappoint.  Check it out and remember I told you so!!"
AWOHJ2QWPK0E,B00DY9X3JO,1.0,"Based on the other reviews posted, I know I am in the minority,but I find this cd so boring as to be unlistenable. I have all of Dianne's cds and I have seen her in concert several times. I consider myself  a fan. This release had a 70s smooth jazz vibe that is hard to listen to. Dracula could not have sucked the life out of Stormy Weather to the extent that  Dianne and co. do. I can't find one redeeming thing to say about this monotonous mess."
A155MWR24Z3GAF,B00DY9X3JO,5.0,Life is good when you can step away from jazz to put your version on a timeless R&B class and make it feel so good.  Diane collaborates with some of my favorite artist on Beautiful Life = add bonus.  What I can say is that I can't wait to hear more.
ALHUWVAYR0K85,B00DYCFKN8,4.0,"I bought both ReVamp CDs after Ms. Jansen was hired to front Nightwish. Very interesting change of pace from that project, but I am enjoying it."
A1GLM8UVJ031VY,B00DYCFKN8,5.0,"Perhaps I am too biased to write this - I will go on record with the opinion that Floor Jansen's is the best female voice in recorded metal today.  Others might legitimately disagree, but that at least will tip you off immediately to the fact that I love this album.  It is Jansen at her best, with her tremendous lyric, dynamic, and tonal range, and a selection of songs that highlight her abilities.However, a single voice is never enough to keep me interested for long. The outstanding thing about After Forever and now Revamp is the ensemble and the composition.  Jansen always surrounds herself with terrific musicians, and the songs are always energetic and interesting, with memorable melodies and fluid harmonies and counterpoint.  I have to say that my personal feeling was that the last work by Revamp had fewer noteworthy songs than I had grown used to from After Forever.  I grew to like that album very much, but it took a while.  By contrast, the work here is instantly likeable, while the compositions are intricate enough that I will be listening for a long time.  The instrumental work is of very high quality, and the production is crisp.If you liked After Forever and/or the previous Revamp work, then you will want this album immediately.  If you enjoyed Jansen with Nightwish or Mayan or other projects, again you will enjoy this.  If you are unfamiliar with these artists, check them out right away."
A28BX68FMNCPKR,B00DYCFKN8,5.0,"I must admit, I didn't care for the self-titled Revamp album.  The music sounded dull, and the very thin production did it no favors and simply took the life out of the music.  The songs sound a lot better live thanks to Floor's wonderful stage presence, but sitting down and listening to the studio recordings feels like a chore.This album, however, is all around solid and there's not a single dull moment to be found.  The progressive metal influence is more readily apparent, and it really adds a lot to the music.  The production has been taken up a notch and has given Revamp's music the oomph it desperately needed before.  The complex arrangements are easier to hear, and Floor Jansen's amazing vocal range is used to even better effect on here.  She even does some pretty great harsh vocals on a few tracks!The best songs would be all 3 in the &#34;The Anatomy of a Nervous Breakdown&#34; trilogy, one of which features the very talented - not to mention prolific - Devin Townsend and the song &#34;Precibus&#34;, which are all just as good as the best songs in the now defunct After Forever's discography, if not better.  Every other song is good too and well worth listening to.Overall, I'd say it's worth picking up, even if (like me) you didn't care for the first album.  The songwriting is solid and the vocals are, of course, amazing because Floor can't really do any wrong when it comes to singing."
ABJ88JZ1DYXCO,B00DYEBM2Y,5.0,"Words cannot describe how much I love Hope Sandoval and Mazzy Star, but here are some that describe Seasons of Your Day... beautiful, wondrous, magical, enigmatic, enchanting, mystical, gorgeous, trippy, sublime, revelatory, and haunting...Hope and David, if you happen to read this, I just want to say thank you for creating music that has brought me so much joy since I first heard \"Fade Into You\" so many years ago. I can't wait for your next release, even if it takes another 17 years..."
A3JDQJMWDDS9Q2,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,I'd originally ordered this cd after hearing him over the radio for some time and then on a music award show recently.  He's quite enjoyable.
A2WXOQN5BM8WB4,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,This is a GREAT CD!!! There are 16 songs on it which make it a terrific buy for the money....I am in my late 50's and after listening to this I have dubbed John Legend the Peabo Bryson of the new Millennium.
A2QRV9CWDLZU2A,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,"I love me some John Legend, yes I'm a granny but love that voice. I like the flow of the musisc"
A1X336YSE4BAW5,B00DYFCYSO,3.0,"John is talented and has a GREAT voice but there are too many ballads and not very stimulating!  I want to be excited when I hear music - even slow songs can draw you in, but this one doesn't."
AGIJFDYFSA05Q,B00DYFCYSO,2.0,"The biggest disappointment is that the best song on the 16 track version \"Angel\" That I purchased is only an interlude WTF. My second complaint is that this is not the deluxe version.  This crap has got to stop, where the heck is the rest of my music?  If I pay for a full CD I want a full CD!To be honest the rest of the songs on the CD are good but not as good as the old John Legend which is a compliment, the only worthy comparison is him in the past.  I know it is hard to be the old you and the new you at the same time still I wished that he would have pushed himself a little more lyrically to make the tracks a bit more uncomfortable.  There is nothing uncomfortable here.  The music is easy to digest both lyrically and musically.  I am not challenged therefore it is boring.  John remains one of the few artists out there I would still pay to go see however this contribution falls short on a lot of levels.+ Good music easy to listen to.+ It is John Legend.- Where is the rest of my music, I got to pay to get what should be on this CD?- Where the heck is the rest of Angel, Only an interlude?- Boring no challege, you can play this for mom."
AJNQTSR3IMW8Z,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,I must say I'm completely blown away how well love in the future sounds it's gotta be his best work. I got say compared to his last album it was very subpar while this album showcases his amazing talent and the whole cd doesn't have one track t skip.
A34C320XATCWKN,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,"This CD arrived much faster than I expected. Hooray!I love the music. Whether you have a sweetheart, or are just a romantic, this is a great album for that &#34;sentimental mood&#34;. Mr. Legend has given us all a very fine gift with this album."
AVK7FIBK13JZ0,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,This CD has a great sound and some wonderful tracks.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end!  I will listen to it often.
A38P3F25AA6VDX,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,This is an easy listening CD by John Legend. He does not disappoint and offers variety as expected by his fans. I would consider buying this CD as a gift for a friend or family member.
AFSWTC59OW4O7,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,"While I enjoyed Evolver, I like many of John's fans was disappointed in that it did not reach the commercial /radio play success that his previous albums did. The songs were good but did not stand out...On this new release, John Legend has reflected on his past and has for the most part created a new album that sonically is new (Made to Love is brilliant) while containing tracks like \"All of Me\" that should have the same impact that \"Ordinary Love\" had.There are many great gems.I would recommend the deluxe version because it has the duet with Seal, \"We Love It\" plus another strong ballad, \"For the First Time.\"2 disappointments, however, missing is the upbeat track \"Tonight (Best You Ever Had)\" Ft Ludacris and \"Dance the Pain Away\" which he did with EDM DJ Benny Benassi.It still seems that both radio and his record company is trying to pigeon-hole John Legend as just a great slow to mid-tempo ballad/singer yet his voice lends itself to electro/dance music and that path would give him a wider audience base.I only wish that the deluxe cd was not package in the cheap/disposable paper packaging which usually helps to damage/scratch the cd. Why is the regular version housed in the far superior standard case instead of vice-versa?"
A14YZVQTMRO7NE,B00DYFCYSO,4.0,The entire disc is good. It's one of those you throw on for a romantic evening. Chill the wine and enjoy.
A66636BCQC0P4,B00DYFCYSO,5.0,I started collecting his CD's recently and now I'm a huge fan!  I love that he can go from ballad to blues to any other style seamlessly!
A344BMJP6A5KL1,B00DYOGQ4S,5.0,"I loved this soundtrack.  Thomas Newman did an excellent job bringing the movie to life through his wonderful music.  Also includes some of the songs from Mary Poppins on the &#34;2nd Disc&#34; (I bought this as an MP3 album, though).  Enjoy!!!"
A7R5MG7X15Q7E,B00DYP48FQ,3.0,"This is okay.  I was a little disappointed in it but more disappointed in the show, but it's a different cd to the rest of my Xmas ones."
AV0VOY1AM3PS8,B00DYP48FQ,5.0,"I am not a Duck Dynasty fan, but I bought this as a gift for a family member who is.  They played it while we were over for the holidays, and I was surprised that all of these rough-faced guys have such pure voices.  I also got a laugh out of the lame duck puns in a couple of the songs."
A1SBLGKJRMPMN3,B00DYP48FQ,5.0,"Soon as I found out they had a CD, I got to Amazon and found it. I had no idea what to expect but I tell you, it was a nice surprise! It has given me another Christmas CD to add to my collection.  I have to admit they won me over with the last tract on the CD &#34;Phil's Prayer, Willie's Closing&#34;. Keeping Christ in Christmas. Amen Guys!!"
A2MHZTTCCUZSMI,B00DYP48FQ,5.0,The cd is perfectly for all ages. Very professional & well recording. The kids know well their parts and &#34;Mr Grinch&#34;' is very funny.
AZKXH0J59TK11,B00DYVUAQQ,4.0,"I have been living with &#34;Inland&#34; for the last two months. And while I can't say it's Jars of Clay's best record (a position that I think belongs to their previous non-religious collection of songs &#34;The Long Fall Back to Earth&#34;), it is certainly in the upper portion of their discography.What makes Jars of Clay a great band, and &#34;Inland&#34; a really strong album, is that they have managed to find variations of their sound without changing it to drastically. There are no EDM breakdowns here. There are no disco guitar lines. &#34;Inland&#34; sounds like a Jars of Clay record.But it doesn't sound like any of the previous Jars records. Though not every song is a winner (both &#34;Pennsylvania&#34; and &#34;I Don't Want You To Forget&#34; are forgettable mood pieces), there are a handful of tracks here that rank with the best stuff they've ever written. And for a ground coming up on their twentieth anniversary that's terribly impressive.The lyrics and music compliment each other well, and the songs have interesting and memorable melodies. There is more emphasis placed on the bass this time around, and it adds some extra heft to these songs.If you are a fan of Jars of Clay you will be pleased with &#34;Inland&#34;. Even if you're not a fan of Jars of Clay there's plenty here to like and admire. It's another fantastic record from a group who just continue to improve."
A3W0POMI33YQXQ,B00DYVUC00,5.0,"The Return of Goodie Mob has been something many hip hop fans have been waiting a long time for. Many people also never really believed in the reunion given the diss tracks and diss albums to go along with Cee-Lo Green's rise to solo stardom.  A reunion seemed unlikely.HOWEVER, the Hip Hop Gods have shown us that they love us as they've reunited the Mob.  For those new to Goodie Mob, it's Big Gipp, T-Mo, Khujo and Cee-Lo Green.  Their debut album Soul Food was fan accepted and critically acclaimed as an all time hip hop classic filled with social commentary about the struggles of the black man and the community.After my 1st listen to their newest offering Age Against The Machine, I didn't understand what in the world I was listening to.  It shocked my system.  Believe me I was ready to start blasting the album.  But the closing song was so powerful it inspired me to re-listen.  It reminded me of what the Goodie Mob and Dungeon Family was all about.  By the middle of my 2nd listen, I \"got it\".  As I'm writing this review I'm on my 6th listen and I love this album.The Goodie Mob have not lost a step when it comes to lyrics.  They all shine but I think Khujo Goodie turns in the best performance this time.  His voice and delivery stand out.  He truly is underrated.  The other members drop quotables and words to live by throughout the album as well though.  The songs are short and to the point and the album flows along seamlessly as The Goodie Mob never wear out their welcome.  Cee-Lo Green goes Lady Killer style on AMY and cranks up some Gnarls esque sounds on Power.  Make no mistake about it, the album's sound is a departure from their earlier work but the message is the same.  The album's sound instead draws from earlier Mob related projects such as Willie Isz (trust me...check that out), Gnarls Barkley, and recent Cee-Lo Green work.  If you go in expecting Soul Food instrumentals part 2 then you will be sorely disappointed. However it's still soulful and funky.Age Against The Machine already has lots of replay value and that's evidence that they actually have something to say on this album (as with all Goodie Mob albums).  In my opinion, the album is best digested as an experience but the songs work individually as well.  This album is highly recommended and in a year full of standout releases, Goodie Mob manages to reinvent themselves and introduce themselves to a new generation of fans while still keeping the message that brought them accolades in the first place.  5 Stars."
AJNQTSR3IMW8Z,B00DYVUC00,5.0,Overall this is one of the best cd to come out this year and the game been missing quality like the goodie mob brought to the scene back in the day. The whole cd from top to bottom rocks hard and should be played at maximum volume and best buy giving away 20 tracks on the exclusive for true fans of the goodie mob.
A3K2PT269IPSD,B00DYVUC00,5.0,"I bought this mainly looking for new sounds and it did not disappoint. This is definitely one of the most creative albums I've heard, every song is awesome!"
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00DYVUCGO,5.0,"Just 24 hours ago a friend of mine named Thomas Carley recommended I seek out the latest release from The Foreign Exchange. Came into streaming some of their songs without knowing anything about the band members or their histories. Even now I still know very little. All I do know of them comes from another friend Henrique. He informed me that the bands founder Phonte was apparently a member of a group called Little Brother-a hip-hop group hailing from Durham,North Carolina. Knowing how hip-hop groups often spin off into completely alternate musical projects such as this,none of that information surprises me one bit. What did surprise me was how they musically presented themselves in the accompanying CD booklet. Some of the music of course is supplied by keyboardist/multi instrumentalist Nicolay. But this album also features,and credits with a great deal of enthusiasm,their 19 piece string section as well as it's arrangers and conductors. That level of respect for the ethic of cinematic music production correctly led me to believe I would be in for a real treat with this album.\"If I Knew Then\" opens the album with a wonderfully expansive funk/jazz fusion number-with melodies and rhythms elevating right up there with the many classics of the late 1970's end of that genre. \"Right After Midnight\" continues on with a powerful synthesizer boogie funk number. This returns to even greater effect on \"On A Day Like Today\"-a number with enough early 80's post disco rhythm box/electronic invention and song craft to make it a potentially enormous hit somewhere even today. The more acoustically textured guitar led jazz-pop of \"Better\" is equally wonderful-especially Phonte's obviously growing vocal turns. Only wild card is a somewhat foul mouthed rap insert from him that,while delivering what turns out to be a good message,is more than a little out of place. \"Listen To The Rain\" returns to that flavor with a full vocal take with no rap. \"Call It Home\" brings a drum-n-bass rhythm flavor to this jazzy funk compositional attitude whereas the house fusion of \"The Moment\" recalls Incognito to some degree.\"Can't Turn Around\" returns to the expansive 70's fusion-funk take and \"Dreams Are Made For Two\" returns to the drum machine led boogie funk before blending the two seamlessly for the closing \"When I Feel Love\" which,through that hybrid sounds close as this album comes to a modern hip-hop based funk-pop production. This album actually succeeds on every level it's creators intended it to. The harmonically rich female vocals of Carmen Rodgers,Shana Tucker,Gwen Bunn,Carlitta Durand and Jeane Jolly combine with Phonte's creamy delivery for a very meaningful and poetic combination of instrumentation and lyricism. The two rap inserts are both well harmonized from the music and are at least from within,which is refreshing in the tail end of the guest rapper age. The way the albums themes are presented are very much in tune with something of a cornucopia of the tail end of the funk era-the stylings from roughly 1977 through 1983 coming into full flower here. The Foreign Exchange are not new and are apparently a live act of high quality. Personally I'd say if this is the direction Phonte is taking them? I'd keep going for it if I were him"
A1HDF7R2FIL4P4,B00DYVUCGO,3.0,"Must agree with previous reviewers that the CD is a bit mediocre in comparison to their previous releases. It does play well from start to finish, but with no standout tracks and no growth in terms of music value & in terms of sound progression from their previous works."
A92F571Y9MTW6,B00DYVUCGO,5.0,"Little Brother member Phonte Coleman got in touch with Nicolay Rook when the latter submitted a remix to a song by the former's group. That remix spawned a musical partnership that would extend into recording a full length album. The trouble was both of the members were in different countries. No worries, as the members recorded their 2004 debut \"Connected\" by way of technology as well as FedEx. By the time they had to tour for the album, they didn't meet each other in person until it was time to perform live. The recording was critically acclaimed and the duo went back to their day jobs. Phonte returned to Little Brother to release their classic sophomore effort \"The Minstrel Show\" and Nicolay released his solo debut \"Here\". After a four year absence, the duo reunited for their second- and best- album, \"Leave It All Behind\". After Little Brother called it quits in early 2010, The Foreign Exchange released their third album at the end of the year- the surprisingly ambitious \"Authenticity\". The following year, Phonte released his long-awaited solo album \"Charity Starts At Home\", while the group reissued their long out of print debut. After time out of the spotlight, it was only a matter of time before the duo paired up again.In 2013, The Foreign Exchange released their fourth album \"Love In Flying Colors\". Almost on the heels of their tenth anniversary as a recording group, they return to the sound that's reminiscent of \"Leave It All Behind\". On the opening track \"If I Knew Then\", they extol the virtues of being in a committed relationship with guest vocals from singer Carmen Rodgers. The Sy Smith featured \"Right After Midnight\" shows a couple dancing together and hoping to lead into a romance. Eric Roberson helps out on the scathing song \"Better\", where Phonte compares his ex-girlfriend to his current flame. Phonte tries to rid his sadness on the acoustic ballad \"Listen To The Rain\", while trying to survive a rough patch in a relationship is the theme of the first single \"Call It Home\". They take a quick detour into house music with \"The Moment\", with Gwen Bunn making an appearance on the jazz fusion inspired \"Can't Turn Around\". Phonte reunites with singer Carlitta Durand on \"Dreams Are Made For Two\", and they close the album with the ballad \"When I Feel Love\". \"Love In Flying Colors\" is another great album in the underrated catalogue of The Foreign Exchange. In a perfect world, the duo would be much more than a one-time Grammy nominated act. Hopefully, that will change for them in the near future."
A1BP4FHEI8FGBB,B00DYWKPAQ,5.0,"so great to hear the Kings back at the top of their game... the opening slot for U2 has paid off in more ways than one... great album, every song... Temple is my favorite, but Beautiful War... Supersoaker... one of their best albums to date."
A1ZQYVC9PMNHFY,B00DYWKPAQ,5.0,"After many listens I really can not get enough, it does get better the more you listen to it! I think this band is great and this album is just a continuation of their great music. I think it sounds closer to some of their earlier stuff as opposed to there last couple releases. If you are thinking about getting it do it!"
A5CD35CXZ9F9N,B00DYWKPAQ,5.0,"I had the album streaming free on iTunes for a few days last week and hearing the deluxe album today, it sounds great.  Can't wait to hear some of the new stuff on tour."
A3DS9VS98FDRTJ,B00DYWKPAQ,5.0,"\"Ah its all better now, its all better now, wait for me, wait for me...\" (Wait For Me, Mechanical Bull)Kings of Leon are a classic god status rock band. Yet Come Around Sundown (their last release) was a bit of a slow, skip this track here, jump to the favorite one only, for me.As an old fan, Mechanical Bull is wearing your favorite T-shirt inside out and anyway you like. You know their sound, you know their lyrics mystify you and you know they rock it from A to Z. \"I got my hands in my pocked and I'm crossing my fingers, I just wannabe noticed....\" (Temple, Mechanical Bull)For new fans, if you accidentally discovered them today, I recommend starting with \"Only By Night\" and then moving to \"Mechanical Bull\" but downloading them together here. And then graduate backwards to their older releases as your adrenalin skyrockets with each pulse, thump and chord flowing from their vocals and fingers. Oh the magic this band possesses. Perfection.\"You rub me the right way, you rub me the right way...\" (Temple, Mechanical Bull)"

A3NWY12NHKP8H3,B00DZAWO1K,4.0,"After ordering &#34;Songs for Christmas&#34; last winter, and being surprised of my like for Wickham's style, I gave his usual music a chance. I was pleasantly surprised again. It took awhile, I admit, for the songs to grow on me.There are a few tracks that I don't care much for, but Wickham's catchy riffs carry along sometimes &#34;all the familiar sayings&#34; in praise songs today. There are new up and coming artists that I feel are enriching contemporary praise music with richer lyrics and deeper theological truths reminiscent of the richness of hymns.Wickham has a good voice, and a good band of musicians, and I hope that in the future he can improve it with richer lyrics than just, again, the oft-repeated sayings that seem to permeate through many bands... to create just mediocre Christian music."
A3RCSTINM7BTKW,B00DZAWO1K,4.0,"With each listen I'm liking this record more and more.  It did not immediately wow me like Cannons or Heaven & Earth did, but definitely worth buying and enjoying.  Some beautiful, poetic lyrics hear.  &#34;Carry My Soul,&#34; &#34;Mercy,&#34; and &#34;Thirst&#34; were the stand-out tracks for me.  Amazing that Wickham is so accomplished and so incredibly talented for one so young."
A1YRP8M1MH92Z3,B00DZAWO1K,5.0,Fast delivery although one of the 2 items' case was a bit &#34;damaged&#34; in one of the corners but I am still satisfied.
A1IMC6NX4P1V9D,B00DZAWP00,4.0,I was very excited about this album for awhile and Brandon didn't disappoint me. I love every track. He's a very talented artist and just amazing in every way. Very proud of him.
ATWMEVKPA3CQ3,B00DZAWP00,5.0,"First off, I'm an Incubus fan, which is what led me to check this album out - and I'm glad I did. Brandon and Brendan's collaboration turned out to be a really great musical experience. The songs are mostly upbeat, artistic, and simply enjoyable. I'm not going to delve into a song-by-song analysis, but I am going to recommend you check this album out. Upon first listen, I liked it; upon second listen, I loved it! It's mixed beautifully, and the production is fantastic (with Brendan O'brien at the helm, who would expect any less?)"
A2W34G5XYDFJWP,B00DZAWPNM,5.0,"Panic's latest album is a most obvious step in the Radio Pop direction: They've finally given up the top hat and cane for a cigarette and rehab. Indeed, most of the songs no longer seem fit for a carnival starring the Beatles. However, some selections have proven to be a bit bland. On the other hand, songs like \"Miss Jackson\" \"This Is Gospel\" and \"\"Girls/Girls/Boys\" are among the best of Panic. What's pretty odd is the title - it would have been fine for an Ed Wood epic, but it seems strange for this particular album. Nevertheless, Panic continues to evolve, namely with the apparent influence of David Gahan/Depeche Mode. Whether intentional or not, what's now dubbed \"Panic Mode\" is far more radio-friendly than \"Srt. Panic's Lonely Top Hat Band\" ever was. Urie's voice has become more of a focus, which is well deserved and hopefully well received in the pop world 2014 (Levine be damned).2.342"
A31JQBH96G914O,B00DZAWPX2,3.0,"Could this be the Sophomore slump? I'm not willing to say just yet, but it may be. Musically this album grabs me much more than lyrically as many of the songs are hard to discern just what the words are although there is a lyrics sheet with very small print. That's a run-on sentence, btw. It's obvious to me from the start that I will like 'Never Trust a Happy Song' more as I really like/love that album and think it has very few weaknesses. The band has a great sound with that album...very energetic and original...the new album sounds like they are just making stuff up. This will probably be a better album to just groove too and not think too hard about what the band is singing. In short: a let-down."
A2AXX0P2JE77MR,B00DZAWPX2,3.0,Really good if you are smoking a fine dooby while you are listening.  Maybe I am too young/old for this.
A3MGKU008K95W9,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,"My favorite MM to date. Production, sequencing, mood - not to mention the songs, This is an album not just a colection of songs..."
A4LMNNGSKAUHE,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,"Just as you start getting into the groove of the first track, the classic Monster Magnet sound just hits you upside the head like a huge Bullgod backhand and you just get transported into a supersonic musical wonderland where you can feel the early influences of Hawkwind soaring over MM's newest sounds...  A long time coming, and worth the wait... Monster Magnet carries the torch of psycho-doom-proto-drug-psychadelic-whatever music proudly!  (It's a satanic drug thing, you wouldn't understand.)"
A2R9CA3YT1WUNV,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,"Last Patrol is the ninth full-length studio album by the legendary Red Bank New Jersey based Stoner Rock (and so, so much more) band Monster Magnet. It was released in October 2013 through Napalm Records and was produced by frontman Dave Wyndorf himself alongside Phil Caivano.It is the band's first full-length album since Superjudge not to feature long time guitarist Ed Mundell, although long time fans will have noticed his absence from the past three year's worth of live dates. To be fair, Dave has done such a fantastic job of maintaining the signature Monster Magnet sound, vibe and attitude that this potentially critical loss is actually well compensated for. If you like what the band have done in the past this certainly won't send you running away in disgust.The album doesn't really have a snappy elevator pitch like \"the band's doomiest album,\" \"the band's catchiest songs to date\" or \"the band's most experimental release yet\" but there's clearly a reason why it's garnering so much positive attention from fans and critics alike. Give it a listen or twelve and let it get underneath your skin, there's a lot going on here and repeat listens allow it to fully reveal all of its many charms.The songs are mostly long, hypnotic and trippy numbers that focus on repeating one riff (acoustic or electric) over and over again on a rolling wave of sound effects or solos, building and building up teasing the listener with their constant threats of flat-out exploding. This isn't so much a collection of easily digestible radio singles but rather a more considered and slow-burning affair. Most of it could be described as laid back or chilled, although its not an distortion-free affair by any means either, so don't fear that it doesn't pick up the pace every now and again for variety.Its very much what you'd want from Monster Magnet to balance out the more immediate previous three albums. A bit of a nod back to their earlier days, without lapsing into falt out nostalgia-farming. You can still very much hear the 70s and particularly 60s rock influences, you still have Dave's absolutely phenomenal vocals, lyrics and undeniable charisma, and you still have virtuosic lead guitar work only now you get it all amidst the drawn-out, slower and trippier side of the band's many-sided skillset, like it was on the first three albums, but with a bit of the new days left in too for good measure.It's the kind of album that will have you nodding in agreement rather than jumping around, but its none the worse for it. If you took the three most trippy songs from Mastermind and extrapolated them into a whole album, then mixed in a bit of Dopes To Infinity's relationship between the hard bits and the light bits, you'd have something vaguely approaching the style of Last Patrol.Highlights include the lively `End Of Time,' (which mixes a Mastermind style bounce with that Hawkwind-influenced Superjudge style) the dynamic single `The Duke (Of Supernature)' which is fabulously entertaining on repeat listens, and the Magnetized Donovan cover `Three King Fishers' which is pretty captivating all around.Overall; Last Patrol is yet another high quality album from the undeniably unique and interesting band, and it definitely deserves a place in your collection. It's a bit of a grower, so give it a fair chance and time to sink in, but in general, if you like the band you should be pretty happy with this release. If you can, try and the special edition version as the two bonus tracks are really enjoyable, not throwaway afterthoughts but rather genuinely cracking Magnet songs that just didn't fit the album's tone."
A33F3DQ39174DF,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,I bought this on cd first and they haven't sounded this good since the beginning.So I had to buy this on vinyl.
A1MYCE4GVE7TC8,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,"This new cd w/ bonus tracks is fantastic, like the other reviews state. They re-invent themselves every time and this holds up with my favorite cd, Powertrip."
AHZ8D94BA9F1N,B00DZPVS9O,5.0,this 1 of my favorites the keep getting better  every album and they have yet to produce a bad one
AEDSOAHJXINN2,B00DZPVSDA,5.0,"Great album! The Answer are a band from the north of Ireland and they rock from start to finish on this record. I got into this band when I saw them open for AC/DC on the Black Ice tour. When you go to see Angus Young (the most riveting guitarist on any stage...ever) and come away thinking \"The Answer were awesome!\", then they must have done something pretty special.There are some outstanding tracks on their latest release, New Horizon. Leave With Nothing, Spectacular, Concrete, and Baby Kill Me are all outstanding songs that are available on the standard edition of the CD. The deluxe edition includes 3 bonus tracks of which Road Less Travelled and Real as it Gets are stellar. The vinyl has another 3 exclusive tracks. White Flag is among those and is also available on iTunes...great song.If you know about The Answer already, then you probably already own this. If you are just discovering them and you like straight forward rock and roll, then you should check out this album as well as Revival, Rise (their debut LP, not the EP), and Everyday Demons. These guys haven't put out a bad album yet."
A20DZX38KRBIT8,B00E00G9GK,5.0,"Many bands seem to go downhill with latter day live performances and albums (Metallica) but Megadeth sound as amazing as they did when they toured this killer record and still regularly release amazing, heavy, quality albums.  The setlist is great, the production is awesome, the performance is flawless and the packaging was great with lots of great photo's.  Worth every penny and a worthy addition to any metal collection and essiential for Megadeth fans \\m/\\m/"
A1VH1G8XO4J70,B00E00GAXC,5.0,"The album is banging, just what I expected. It's a really good buy. I would recommend it to anyone to purchase"
A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00E00GAXC,2.0,"The title, I assume, is a reference to mind-altering drugs. \"I get high,\" a soul sample says. There's also a song entitled Smokin Rollin, about puffing weed on a tour bus. \"I smoke more than a hippie,\" Juicy J boasts. If these lyrics are any indication, when the Memphis thug isn't gunning a man down for his money, throwing money at a bad \"bitch\" or simply counting his money; the guy loves money; he's immersed in a world of drugs, primarily marijuana and alcohol. And that's just what you'll need to fully appreciate this set, which works as urban strip club music and not much else. The beats bang, in the literal if not in the aesthetic sense, but, at-least when it comes to those of us whose brains aren't warped by kush and \"Drank\", Juicy J's syncopated vocals and \"ignant\" lyrics leave much to be desired.marcellee.com"
A14IHYR5TMYNEA,B00E03UKEE,5.0,I liked the tracks on this album and especially like the title track. Natalie Grant has a great voice and her music shares God's love for His creation. That is important to me if the music does not share the gospel it has no meaning and Natalie Grant's music shares it.
A3O2ZA4F8E8OFD,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"A fine return to skull pummeling melodic death metal for these Brits. It seems a bit repetitive and \"samey\" at first, but with repeated listens this one is bound to be a true contender for album of the year because all the elements you'd really want in an album of this nature are all present and the band is shown in top form, essentially starting right from where they left off 17 years ago, and potentially surpassing that point. Like fine wine, this band has refined their core sound while also retaining the brutality and visceral edge that made them a classic band right form the get-go. A great album for any metal collection."
A1BNXI06KMEWXT,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"This has been a pretty interesting year for metal. So far we have seen new releases from Megadeth, Sodom, and Autopsy, as well as new projects from Jason Newsted and Phil Anselmo. We have also seen the come back of Black Sabbath. Even though these releases have been exciting to varying degrees, I can not think of any I have anticipated more then the return of Carcass. Since I received my preorder days ago in the mail, Surgical Steel is all I have been listening to.This release is definitely more in line with Heartwork then the earlier releases. The music in no way feels rushed or forced but rather it sounds like a band who has matured. It also seems that musically the album has less of a death metal influence and more of a thrash metal style going on. The album begins with an instrumental with just guitars then rips into the next track Thrasher's Abattoir and continues this furious pace until the end.I think most Carcass fans will love this album. Surgical Steel almost seems as though to be a more logical progression from Heartwork rather then Swansong and whatever death metal vibe they might have had left in them when the last two albums were released is gone. This is Carcass now.Have A Nice Day"
A1BPFV0N4C12AI,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"It's safe to say we've all been waiting quite awhile for this one.  And man oh man was it worth the wait.Steer's rhythm guitar work, running the gamut from speed metal licks to thrash riffs to melodic hooks to tremolo picks, is superlative.  Walker's rasp & lyrical wizardry are in top form.  The drumming is tight.  The production is slick.So far I'm liking all of the tracks.  I'm trying to find a weak link in the bunch and so far I'm not finding it.  The only one that I will call out by name is the surprising 8+ minute final track, \"Mount of Execution\", and its throwback to NWOBHM/early thrash riffs & imagery; in terms of Carcass' own history, and given the song's slower pacing, it's more like a track from the Swansong era than anything else.  This is not a bad thing - this is a top track.And lastly, I might add, it's also great to hear Bill Steer's guttural growl return on some backing vocals.  Haven't heard that since the Necroticism days.If you are a fan of Carcass then I'd wager that it's almost impossible to be disappointed with this album.  So go buy a copy!"
A1K6U1XA0RC7QR,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"I'm not the world's biggest death metal fan - I do like it, but not as much as other genres of metal.  When I first gave this a listen I was not really aware of the press this record was getting, and by no means would I say I was a Carcass fan.  I'd heard Heartwork years back and enjoyed it, that's it.  It was in that relative vacuum that I first consumed this orgy of gory imagery, heroic leads, blazing thrash riffs and razor sharp drumkit precision.  I was blown away.  The record gave me goosebumps as only an incredibly well executed heavy metal album can.  It's hard to remember quite the last time I felt this way when putting on a death metal album - I remember feeling similar sensations of excitement and shock when I first spun At The Gates \"Slaughter of the Soul\" and Lamb of God's \"As the Palaces Burn.\"  Good company for Surgical Steel, I must say.I don't think a lot of people are checking out Carcass just for the throat-scraping vocals, as unexpectedly witty and funny as vocalist/bassist Jeff Walker's lyrics are.  They're looking to get pummeled and taken away by the riffs.  And this record delivers some of the best riffs of the year, and some of the best riffs I've ever heard, quite frankly.  They bludgeon and they soar, they thrash, and oh do they groove.  These guys break it down as well as - actually probably everyone I would reference has been influenced by Carcass so...never mind.  Some credit there should go to new 24 year old drummer Daniel Wilding, who plays like he has something to prove to his influential bandmates, who are 20 years his senior.  I find myself humming the Iron Maiden/Thin Lizzy-esque lead riffs to \"The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills\" and \"316L Grade Surgical Steel\" (great titles) at random times during the day, even when I haven't been listening to this album - meaning that these parts are permanently stuck in my brain.  No easy task.  This is death metal after all, not necessarily known for catchy hooks.  Carcass knows how to write parts that stick with you, which really sets them apart.  And since they're total instrumental wizards who can play just about any lead, solo or part that they wish, the possibilities seem limitless.  They're combining technical, jaw-dropping feats of proggy guitar heroics with a real ear for melody in the songwriting - a rare thing, especially in extreme metal.  I've done my research and listened to most of Carcass' back catalog, and this album seems like a triumphant combination of all the avenues they've explored before.  Punishing, straight ahead brutal hardcore, grind and death metal, melodic death metal, progressive rock and even straight up hard rock.  It's all there in Surgical Steel, arranged and balanced perfectly.For me, this isn't the cathartic return of my childhood heroes like it is for many in the metal community.  To me, it's just an absolutely outstanding heavy metal record, one I never imagined I'd love this much.  Long live Carcass."
A26GKJ87NEDTPD,B00E0G5S20,5.0,been waiting for this ever since i heard the news that they were working on a new one - IT'S BEEN WELL WORTH THE WAIT ..... excelent job guys ..... great album - cant stop listening .....
A338PR8O42RTA0,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"Out of my 1500 cd's (90% metal) this is the best one that I have ever owned and heard.  I have listened to this at least 50 times and am shocked at the flawless quality on this grindcore,  NWOBHM,  melodic death/thrash metal masterpiece.  The aggressive,  and very melodic,  riff-driven,  metal music is immaculate.  The drumming (very tight and there's also double bassing),  the guitarwork  (machine-gun tempos, solos, riffs, twin-guitar harmonies),  the bass (pounding and relentless),  the vocals (death/black metal) are all godly.  This is a beautiful piece of work,  a beautiful collage,  which is the true definition of Classical music.  The best, in form,  it flows well: brutal and primitive yet refreshingly progressive and phenomenal in the compositional sense.All musicians (Jeff Walker - vocals, bass; Bill Steer - vocals, guitars; Dan Wilding - drums) are exceptional masters of their craft.  Thank God for the high production quality of this cd by geniuses Colin Richardson - production, Andy Sneap - mixing, mastering, Carl Brown - recording engineer.  This cd can be in a higher-end sound system down to a lower-end boom box and it still sounds great."
A2LTL305X8YRBY,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"Some might say that I'm a novice listener after only listening to Carcass for a few years. Symphonies Of Sickness, Necrotism and Heartwork were in constant rotation on my CD player when I first started. I have a firm understanding on their sound: they were early practitioners of grindcore and they evolved their sound into melodic death metal. Some would say that Heartwork was their \"sellout\" point even though they got little to no radio play. Enough about history. It's 2013, and they have their first new album in nearly 17 years. The sound is still very much melodic death metal, but with dark lyrics that bring to mind Symphonies Of Sickness and Necrotism. Longtime producer Colin Richardson (Napalm Death, Fear Factory, Machine Head) was at the production helm, but I read that he quit about a month into mixing the album. Only a few times that I remember have there been an album that he produced but didn't mix: Fear Factory's Demanufacture, Machine Head's The More Things Change..., and Napalm Death's Inside The Torn Apart. Not because he didn't try, but sometimes the band's wanted to go in another direction with the mix. For Surgical Steel, Andy Sneap (Megadeth, Amon Amarth, Arch Enemy) did the final mix and added his own flavor which resulted in Carcass, but with a little bit more grit & grime. You'll also notice that Michael Amott is absent as he's been busy with Arch Enemy and felt that doing a new Carcass album wasn't happening for him. Believe me, he is missed. That's not going to distract you from enjoying this album though. If you find this CD at a store, get the deluxe edition for the bonus track. It's cheap, and the CD is longer."
A24BSIUPHLX0NZ,B00E0G5S20,5.0,"Ever since their final recording 1995's Swansong on Earache records alas 18 years to the future..Surgical Steel emerges from the rusty depths of metal/grind at it's best,first off only two members are left bassist Jef Walker and guitarist Bill Steer with new members Dan Wilding behind the kit and a new live co-guitarist Ben Ash..long time Carcass producer Colin Richardson is back at the recording console with tracks being mixed by Andy Sneap I have to say these guys have not lost anything period..., imagine the new album as a extension of the famous 1993 album Heartwork Carcasses best album till Surgical Steel the last track Mount of Execution feels like several songs put together in a medley of sorts Bills leads are crystal clear with lots of re verb to make them even bigger and even touches of melodic passages through out every song with catchy hooks and timings.., this &#34;come back&#34; album is by far the best in 2013 I've listened to hope to listen to more British grind gore from these masters in the future."
AFHEGYXMK6HCL,B00E0P8VOS,5.0,"This is the best Grateful Dead concert I have heard from the 100s of concerts I have heard. The band are at their peak with every song played like a band obsessed. The one song That really stands out for me here is the magnificent version of 'Playing In The Band' . This track has all the elements of what is good about The Grateful Dead, boogie, rock, blues, country and Psychedelic all mixed together with some great guitar solos from Jerry and the Dead's trademark jams. I love the entire concert, there is not a dud moment. This is the one concert to get if you want to discover more of this band.The concert DVD is a historic visual record of what it was like to be at a Grateful Dead concert in 1972. Lots of naked hippies and people having a great time with no violence and lots of love and happiness.A must get for any dead heads and curious fans."
A1121AAUBIS9PQ,B00E0P8VOS,5.0,"This is one of those shows that could be played to the uninitiated to show them what all the fuss is about. One of the best shows from one of the best years in the history of the band in glorious sound ( for 41 year old tapes). The DVD/Blue-Ray captures the Dead in all their telepathic, non-showbiz glory on a heat-stroked afternoon in August. Hippies are thrown in at no extra cost. A time capsule in that regard but some of the best \"rock\" music ever created, period. The Dead at the peak of their artistic vision creating something never really seen before. Run, don't walk to get this."
A2CARFAX5FNQT9,B00E0P8VOS,5.0,"Has the vibe of the Dead of course which give the sense of community and What a Long Strange Trip!  But in Harmony with the Great Spirit, of course."
A2IN9E8KG73OLV,B00E0P8VOS,5.0,"The recordings from Europe '72 contain many of my favorite Grateful Dead \"live\" recording. This one has more great live recordings from 1972. This lineup of the Greatful Dead with Keith and Donna Godchaux is my favorite. Having the DVD along with the CD's just makes this even better. Seeing that lineup from that era is truly vintage Dead material."
A3L9FT8OJY4Q6I,B00E0P8VOS,4.0,"\"The rock music group Grateful Dead is scheduled to perform at a 'potluck picnic' Sunday, sponsored by the Springfield Creamery.\"  Eugene Register-Guard Newspaper.\"Do you hear that same sweet sound again?\"  \"Bird Song\".For Deadheads this was (is) a mythical concert from 1972. And now, finally, it's being released in it's entirety along with a DVD (or Blue-Ray) of (most of) the concert.  Over the years this concert has risen in many fan's eyes as a musical --almost spiritual--highlight of The Dead's many great sets.  This concert was just after the band had returned from Europe, which has provided fans (like me) with many hours of great music.  And this set is no different.  As Garcia has said \"...the music played the band.\"The band still had that looseness that's so much a part of their music.  But their playing was as intuitive and as tight as I've ever heard--and besides albums, I was lucky enough to steadily hear them live--indoors and out--in the Bay Area from '68 through '70, and sporadically thereafter.  Because of what The Dead do with the music, their playing can sometimes be ramshackle--they can lose that thread that holds everything together.  But not here. Not this time.  Everyone plays as one mind--in control but always searching, exploring for that key that unlocks the music for both the band and the audience.A benefit for the Kesey Creamery, (people were afraid that someone would dose the kiddies' milk and cancelled contracts) it was also the last true meeting up with The Pranksters.  The hot sun (\"We're changing our name to the Sun-Stroked Serenaders\"--Bob Weir.) kept the instruments out of tune, but the band somehow got past that and played a tremendous set.  During the concert the band became so focused on the music that they played through all the problems.  And the lucky attendees found shade under any available trees and and just enjoyed The Dead  playing a mythical set of music--which the DVD bears out.All you need to do is hear the band begin to slide into \"Sugaree\", and then \"Black-Throated Wind\".  And on into \"China Cat..Rider\" (whoa!) and you know you're hearing something special.  But listen to \"Bertha\" (a personal favorite), or the 20 minute \"Playing In The Band\", a lively \"He's Gone\", and The Dead rarity \"Bird Song\".  And even after hearing  a number of good/great versions of \"Dark Star\" from the \"Europe '72\" set, the 31 minute version here is a standout.  There's the beautiful \"Sing Me Back Home\", followed by a fine \"Sugar Magnolia\".  And these are just a few high points.  Deadheads will have their own favorites.  And I have to say that Garcia is simply on fire.  Just listen to where he takes the music on \"Playing...\" for example.  And he doesn't build up to something--he's doing it from the start.But there's moments like that all over this set.  And it doesn't matter where or when it happens because it will happen.  This is one of those special times for band and audience alike.  Garcia fans will definitely not be disappointed.  As for the rest of the band--after the Europe trip--you can hear how well they're playing literally from the beginning.  For fans of early Dead (like me) this is about as good as it gets--and I've been a fan (this was before the term \"Deadhead\" was coined) since their first vinyl album release.I still remember buying their first album (with the weird cover that suggested that this was something different) and slipping the album onto my stereo (the kind where the speakers are attached  to the turntable with very short wire) and hearing \"Cream Puff War\", \"New New Minglewood Blues\", and \"Viola Lee Blues\".  Hmmm.  This was something new.  From that point I never missed a new Dead album. I even came across (the now) vinyl rarities \"Historic Dead\" and \"Vintage Dead\", which was full of live and mysterious music.  But if you're not into this period of the band that much--this may change your mind--after blowing it.The DVD is a good quality look at the whole adventure--shot on \"spec\".  And as apparently loaded on LSD as many others, the film-makers managed to document almost everything (there's some tracks missing from the film) that went down on that sunny Sunday.  Garcia was surprised that anyone wanted to film the band--\"Why?  We just stand there.  We don't do anything.\"  But having a visual account of the concert is well worth having for views of both fans and the band.  The film taps into what the Grateful Dead experience was all about.  The sound and picture is better than you might think.  Having the complete audio concert is something special--but having the visual record of that day is something altogether different.  The film elevates everything to a higher level.  This edition has no booklet--just a short essay by David Lemieux about the concert, inside the quad-fold packaging.I should let people know that this is also available through The Dead website as a limited (12,500) edition.  At a higher price you get a 40 page booklet with essays by David Lemieux and others, a tie-dye slipcase, and an exclusive bonus documentary \"Grateful Days\" with new interviews with Mountain Girl, Ken Babbs, Wavy Gravy, and others.  But for most Deadheads the music is the most important thing, so this \"regular\" edition will do nicely.  It's nice to finally have this historic set available in good sound and visuals.  This can sit next to \"Europe '72\" with no problem.  And don't forget the NRPS' live set, also from the same Veneta Dead concert.  Up next is the Garcia/Legion Of Mary set, coming soon."
A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B00E0P8VQQ,5.0,"I loved the early Patty Griffin albums, so I was delighted that this &#34;long lost&#34; 3rd album was finally seeing the light of day. As with such buried musical treasures, the expectations were high, but I'm very happy with what I hear on this album.Things start off on a slightly harsh note, with the intense, smoldering rock tune &#34;Little God.&#34; It's definitely not the typical Patty Griffin type song, and yet I thought the defiant tone of this song made for a perfect opening tune to this eclectic set of songs. Amongst this batch are, in my opinion, some of the finest songs that Patti Griffin has written and recorded. And that's a lot of fine music over the past two decades. When she puts her heart and soul into a song, the magical, expressive voice carrying the day, I can't think of any other contemporary vocalist who can move me to tears, or puts a lump in my throat like she does. This woman is a true musical treasureThe CD clocks in at nearly one hour, and not a minute is wasted. Hard to believe that this impressive album remained unreleased for so many years. Get it!"
A21NRLPZH4UBMS,B00E0P8VQQ,5.0,"I was lucky enough to know people who knew people who knew people that I heard, many times, the original Silver Bell, and because of that I favor the original. On the other hand Glyn Johns has done a wonderful job of re-producing the album. Over the years, after Silver Bell, Patty Griffin, has drifted further and further from the material on this album, especially the hard core rock and roll. I buy all of Patty's stuff, but don't keep it all, though as I get older, I like the quieter stuff very much. Anyway you cut it, this is an essential album to any collection and especially if you love Patty Griffin's tremendous talents."
AVYHWCIW5LNAX,B00E1C4SJC,5.0,"Irish folk group Clannad is back with a great studio album titled 'Na'du'r' (13 tracks) after a 25 year hiatus. The band is also celebrating its 40 years in the music industry. Na'du'r is the Gaelic word for Nature. The CD has a great mixture of esoteric, pop/rock, classical, cappela & jazz musical sounds. There are great vocals/harmonies as in the tracks \"Vellum\" (opening track with very rich esoteric sound & wonderful melody), \"TransAtlantic\" (classical track with great piano & melody), \"The Fishing Blues\" (a pop/rock track with wonderful guitar & harmonica playing), \"A Quite Town\" (up-tempo pop track with a beautiful melody) & \"Setanta\" (great harp sound & melody). My real welcome surprise was the wonderful harp melodies in the tracks \"Lamh ar Lamh\", \"A Song In Your Heart\" (great esoteric musical sound) & \"Setanta\".Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the tracks \"Vellum\", \"TransAtlantic\", \"The Fishing Blues\", \"A Quiet Town\" (my pick for the best track from this great CD) & \"Setanta\".On overall, the Clannad is back with a great Irish folk album in 'Na'du'r': great tunes, excellent music execution and production. A highly recommended CD listening."
A3RUELJU4YDP4J,B00E1LQ7Q0,3.0,"Not the slam dunk CD I had hoped it would be and I am a die-hard JT fan!  Is Justin losing his touch or am I losing my ear for good music.  At best there are a few good tracks to be had here, but for the most part, the two CD collection could definitely be condensed down to the one he originally came out with.  The one saving grace is that this 2-Cd set didn't cost much more than the one CD he released a few weeks earlier."
A1B621EA66Z8KV,B00E1LQ7Q0,5.0,"as a huge fan of his ever since nsync...one thing about justin, he makes great music!!  & this collection has both parts 1 & 2, every song is soooo good and also so different than what you hear on the current radio stations.  it's definitely different from futuresex/lovesounds...that album was more of a dance/club feel, this is more of a groove feel if you get my meaning.  i personally love tko and take back the night...i can't believe those 2 songs never made it in the top 10 on the hot 100.  but if you like great music, you'll like every single song on this album ;)"
A21T5QFJWGXVR,B00E1ZIZ6G,1.0,Very disappointed in the Gabriel cuts.  Very moody and some are almost lifeless.  The other disc with the various artists covering Gabriel are much more listenable.
ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,B00E1ZIZ6G,4.0,"This is actually a package of two different albums: Peter Gabriel's 2010 collection of cover songs Scratch My Back and the late 2013 followup And I'll Scratch Yours, which has (most of) the artists whose songs Gabriel sang on that album reciprocating by performing Gabriel's songs. (A few backed out of the project or declined to participate, sadly including David Bowie, Radiohead, Neil Young and Ray Davies.)So don't expect a single, unified musical experience from this package. &#34;Scratch My Back&#34;, which features Peter Gabriel performing with piano and chamber orchestra, is definitely an excellent, high-concept musical experience as the songs all share similar orchestral colors. But like most tribute albums, I found &#34;And I'll Scratch Yours&#34; to be a hit-and-miss hodgepodge with brilliant moments but also less brilliant ones.I like &#34;Scratch My Back&#34; a lot, but as both a popular and classical music enthusiast, I am positively disposed to &#34;crossover classical&#34; music -- things like most of what Sting has done for the last few years, or Tori Amos' fantastic album Night of Hunters. Hell, I even like the orchestral version of The Who's Tommy.What we have in &#34;Scratch My Back&#34; is a lushly orchestrated set of Peter Gabriel music, even if he didn't write it. The atmosphere is somber and wistful overall. Very frequently, Gabriel deconstructs the music so completely that the songs are hardly recognizable, for example with Bowie's &#34;Heroes&#34; and Paul Simon's &#34;Boy in the Bubble&#34;, both of which dissolve into lovely orchestral atmospherics punctuated by Gabriel's voice bearing only slight resemblance to the original singing.&#34;And I'll Scratch Yours&#34; is definitely a mixed bag, however. (But you can count on two fingers the &#34;tribute&#34; albums that I really like -- they are almost always real hit-and-miss affairs.)I found the brightest spots when the artists did a similarly thorough deconstruct of Gabriel's music as he did in his covers. The late, great Lou Reed transforms the light and airy &#34;Solsbury Hill&#34; into a dystopian, arrhythmic fuzz-guitar fest. I had never heard of Joseph Arthur before, but he actually pulls a somewhat similar feat with &#34;Shock the Monkey&#34;. Feist (who I previously knew mainly from my son's Sesame Street DVD, where she sings a wonderful song about counting to four) also does an excellent, stripped down &#34;Don't Give Up&#34;.Another highlight is Randy Newman's take on the hit &#34;Big Time&#34;. Of course it comes out dripping with irony that was not as obvious in the original. It actually sounds like it could have been written by Randy Newman -- a kind of prequel to his early number &#34;Lonely at the Top&#34;. Fantastic.Paul Simon's 12-string guitar take on &#34;Biko&#34; is pretty great too. It kind of felt to me like Simon was getting some closure on South Africa with this one. Steve Biko was an anti-apartheid activist killed by police brutality in 1977. Although he was not a member of the African National Congress, the ANC does recognize him as a hero in the struggle against apartheid. Paul Simon caught hell from the ANC for breaking their cultural boycott of South Africa with his &#34;Graceland&#34; album, and it was actually a pretty big deal at the time. Paul Simon's final reconciliation with the ANC establishment is caught on film in the 2012 documentary film Under African Skies.A lot of the covers fell short for me, though. I'm not too into synth-pop/techno things, and we certainly have some of that here. David Byrne, normally a musical hero for me, kicks the album off with an ironically oriented electronic version of &#34;I Don't Remember&#34; that falls short, as does &#34;Not One of Us&#34;, which was like a mildly nightmarish flashback to my 1980s teen years. Arcade Fire does OK on &#34;Games Without Frontiers&#34;, but I felt they played it too straight rather than really making it their own.Another thing that stands out is that no one touches Gabriel's ultimate smash hit, &#34;Sledgehammer&#34;. I imagine Gabriel asked people not to choose that one. It has been covered a lot anyway.So overall this is a nice package. I like it. I'd give 4.5 stars to &#34;Scratch My Back&#34; alone, and 3.5 to &#34;And I'll Scratch Yours&#34;. Recommended."
AK7LUTN5GEINZ,B00E21D870,2.0,"Ok I love house music, and I really like Kaskade...I've seen him live twice. But this cd is just so bad. I like the chill-out type of house songs that Kaskade usually makes, but this cd brought that sound to another level - a level I like to call naptime. Literally I could fall asleep to some of these songs because they're so boring. Sorry, but I personally do not enjoy this album, at all."
A3R4794K2RVU1S,B00E21D870,5.0,"Kaskade has always stayed true to his roots, while continually able to produce refreshing and pleasing-to-the-ear music.Atmosphere strikes me as a personal and passionate piece for Kaskade. He offers his own voice in his single, Atmosphere. His voice is soulful, authentic, and passionate. Whether it's the chillout singles like LAX to JFK, SFO to ORD, or upbeat singles like &#34;Feel the night,&#34; you can feel his personality and his journey through the years.Atmosphere is a remarkable album. Great for relaxing & and taking a moment to go to another place."
A1YC0PWZDH50HP,B00E21DCR6,3.0,"three years in the making? and this is all they come up with? this album was pushed back several times so they could cut/add more songs. so my question is, where are the songs? only 11..it was suppose to have had 10 but they were gonna add three more..so where are they? its an alright album..not worth the wait though. its no where as good as their last one. and who goes on tour about a year before the album comes out? dont ya want ur fans to hear the new material? guess not. i asked them this question on facebook, and they blocked me. shows what little people they are..their tour is prolly gonna be over soon and their album had just came out..i guess wait till next tour and album..maybe next time, it wont take three years to make a stupid album.."
AWH57IOHA4A89,B00E34A932,5.0,"The Devil Wears Prada has produced a masterpiece. From start to finish, the album produces a gloomy aura that few can ever produce. I would strongly recommend this album to anyone."
ARAU6CGO18WT9,B00E34A932,5.0,"For the first time since Dear Love, the Devil Wears Prada has actually returned to their heavier, grittier roots. Everything about 8:18 is great. They finally stopped recycling old riffs and breakdowns in favor of totally new music, and instead of consistent highs and lows on the screams, they chose to get gritty, almost Beartooth-ish. The screams aren't overproduced this time around, and they have a genuine quality to them. 8:18 possibly has the best growls that TDWP has ever acheived. The clean vocals are also far better. Instead of the constant high-pitched, strained wailing, there is a comfortable low vocal pattern that really adds some emotion to what has been a fairly boring band. The progressive metal switch-up is a fresh change. With bands like We Came As Romans, Memphis May Fire, and Sleeping With Sirens all shamelessly trying to be radio friendly, it is nice to a see a band that hasn't forgotton what metal truly is."
A357LUSFAF6NJM,B00E34A932,5.0,"We expect that rush we got the moment we first loved them.  Whichever album, whichever song, we develop an affinity that translates into a sort of ownership in our minds.  That's why when bands come out with something that bucks that expectation we feel cheated, let down, right off the bat.  I'm of the opinion that if you like a follow up album right out of the gate it's a strong indicator for weakness.  Not always, but often.People change.  It's a fact, an undeniable truth as immutable and unchangeable as the ocean tide.  So it follows that it should be utterly impossible to create a work of art highly similar to the last while still remaining sincere, still putting your heart into it.  To an extent, if you're continuing to put your heart into your art, it HAS to evolve.  Evidence to that effect can be found in your music collections, if they're anything like mine, the ones that contain the most heart, the most artistic genius, are the ones that evolve.HOWEVER, there is a hybrid, more powerful than both: A balance you can reach, between similarity (keeping your style), and changing (evolving musically), that is stronger than one or the other by itself.  Suffice it to say that The Devil Wears Prada have managed to strike that balance pretty well with 8:18.  I loved With Roots Above and Branches Below to an extent, this is not like that album, and after listening through the automatic betrayal that brings with it, you begin to hear the glory that comes with art from the soul.Fun Stuff.  Give it a buy."
A3AIFDV9KLN58W,B00E3I3KDE,5.0,"Great Music, and so nice to get it all on one set, She is great and I hope we get more from her soon!"
A3IR5M75J6MDV4,B00E3I3KDE,4.0,"I loved Goulding's song, &#34;Lights,&#34; so I bought Halcyon Days.  Well, there is some good music here, and I enjoyed it more or less.  Her voice is a little whiny and does begin to annoy after a while."
A2AIMXT9PLAM12,B00E3ISHR8,3.0,"The Rachmaninov First has lost its position as a rarely heard work, on records at least. After being lost for sixty years and then reconstructed after WW II, the score became standard fare in the Soviet era. Various Russian conductors have the measure of the music, so very fine readings are available from Svetlanov onward. If you own the EMI account under Mariss Jansons or the newest one, also on EMI, from young Vasily Petrenko, this anodyne performance by Slatkin and the Detroit Sm. really isn't enticing. As with the first two installments in his Rachmaninov symphony cycle, the conducting approaches this passionate, turbulent music without enough engagement.Since the orchestra has had its struggles, in keeping with the problems of other regional American orchestras since the downturn of 2007, I wish that Naxos was producing a series of winning recordings from Detroit.  but Slatkin is coasting, which is true, more or less, in the releases with his other orchestra in Lyon.  It's a shame that a promising talent has petered out this way. In any case, the program begins with Rachmaninov's best-known tone poem, The Isle of the Dead, given a lifeless reading that proceeds from bar to bar without making any impression. The symphony begins with a fairly strong statement of the score's leading motif, only to lapse into rote music-making. The two inner movements make an effect of prettiness only. the finale finds more energy - it could hardly summon less - but lacks tension and conviction. throughout the orchestra plays with tight ensemble, and the various solos come off well, without seeming like anything special.This Rachmaninov cycle has received some very good reviews at various places, and I wish the orchestra a brighter financial future. But the Russians own these symphonies. For a gripping account by an American orchestra, one has to go back to Ormandy and the Philadelphians, who carried the banner for Rachmaninov at a time when everyone else was content to let it fall."
A1AL15PY5AVFNX,B00E3JGCEW,3.0,"On their 8th album, Philadelphia&#8217;s Dr. Dog play it loose & fun, with a classic country pop edge that mixes a number of styles:  50s roots-harmony indie pop, backporch gospel-clap Dylan rock, banjo-pickin&#8217; folk music with horns & fiddles & odd sounds, acoustic guitar-strum traditional style folk ballads, funky keyboard blues numbers, pretty & twisted psych/pop ballads, and more.  An overall raucous and eclectic sense of down-home good-time music pervades &#8220;B-Room&#8221;.  Sort of like a mix of Wilco and The Band, playing at the local bar with a sloppy, but heartfelt, style of diverse Americana.  Not bad, but I long for the &#8220;finished&#8221; feel and honest beauty of 2010&#8217;s &#8220;Shame, Shame&#8221;."
A2NO8UVH0HJQUW,B00E3JGCEW,5.0,"As you know, I am rather a jazz-funk fiend. But this album of indie-music, queer and strange, captures me entirely. This is knee-deep pop music with heavy references to Mott the Hoople and Bowie of the very early 70s which is just plain fun to listen to.Hats off to the guys from Dr. Dog - it's simply such a refreshing album.Keep the good work on, Dr. Dog!Going back in time to come up with the future: what a delight!Enjoy!"
A2IFM36ETSU5CT,B00E3Q723A,5.0,"Too bad this was the end for phill. Awesome cd, very good guitars. John Sykes is awesome on here. Buy it!"
ATO7I57X6O1H1,B00E4DJLEU,5.0,"Most of the music I listen too features alot of electronics, this album doesn't. The amazing songwriting and vocals transcend genre. So good."
A11BF3WX0WJ24N,B00E4Q70SQ,5.0,"Yet another remarkable release from one very talented singer/songwriter!  This is Blunt's best release to date, expanding an already outstanding catalogue.  There's not a single miss on this one...every track is a wonderful gem!  This is a very well produced package of incredibly beautiful songs.  Truly awesome....enjoy!"
A3PCTD8QM1BIXI,B00E4U81TO,2.0,"The Weekend first gained attention with his trilogy of mixtapes, which he later remastered and released as Trilogy. I'm not the biggest fan of The Weekend's vocal style, however I don't deny his talent so I was willing him to give him a chance. Listening to his debut almost put to sleep while listening to it with a clear mind. The album is a little bit overly ambitous for a major label debut. As many proffesional reviews, have stated there isn't that Yeezus]] in the sense that the album won't be for all tastes. The album does have a few highlights with the singles Kiss Land, Love In The Sky For and the Drake assited Live For.  I'm all for creative control and an artist staying but with The Weekend being backed by Drake, I expected a stronger major label debut and this just isn't it. Maybe a track produced by fellow Candian Boi-1da would helped out.  If you want some good R&B;, two GREAT albums R&B; released last week wereA Place Called LovelandandAppreciation Day. I was rooting for The Weekend but his debut just didn't cut it for me."
A1U1VVLJA7LAX0,B00E4V099S,3.0,"I was impressed by only half of the songs on the CD. She has done better work previously. The riffs were more smoke filled back rooms than prime time, crowd filled, dance hall jams. I liked almost if not all of the cuts on her previous CD's."
A30NFXK24GVIUD,B00E4V0ACY,5.0,"Donald Lawrence is one of my favorite Gospel Artist.  Most of the songs on this album have been remade with different artists singing them.  However, if you love Donald, it won't matter.  The songs are my favorites so I would buy this again and again."
A2PCZOX3D0EFP8,B00E4V0IG2,4.0,It has a sort of flow to it. Not all of the songs are favorable to me but Lyfe's lyrical content remains true to who he is and that is what makes this a solid album.
A1A535W556ROBQ,B00E5GK654,4.0,"I'm a bit confused by the dates if some of these songs are supposed to be from his pre-Small Faces years, as the band was formed in 1965.  Of course, you can find these songs as extras on other releases, so there is nothing really new here except the odd packaging."
A3J09TH0D7BVN7,B00E5N8DX4,2.0,"Well, Uncle Ted rocks this out, BUT he keeps repeating the same same same crap over and over between songs and sometimes in the songs. How many times can you say &#34;Spirit&#34;, &#34;Funk Brothers&#34;, &#34;Motown&#34;, Blood Brothers&#34; ad nauseam. Over and over again. Dementia at least must be causing this. Of course we know he spews so much hatred for anything other than gun loving meat eaters. JUST SHUT UP TED AND PLAY YOUR GUITAR!!!!!!"
A10KCGSDJJAVRO,B00E5N8EPQ,3.0,"Solid but unspectacular collection of latter-day Ray. It is neither lenghtly nor a fair representaion of what Ray did for music, black music and the American culture (especially as a blind, black male in the segregated 1960s). One of the nice things about this collection is that it offers a dozen tracks that don't often come up on Ray Charlwes best of/anthology sets, so for that reason it may be worth searching out. The Deluxe Version includes a DVD. None of these string-ladden, pop songs touches on his brilliant and ground breaking early work, but as a listen, you can't argue with any selection. Fairly mellow (and safe) picks, mind you."
A2YUJP9OAH7ULO,B00E5N8EPQ,5.0,"I LOVE IT! I WOULD SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL RAY CHARLES FANS.  VERY GOOD COLLECTION OF TUNES.  SOME I'VE HEARD BEFORE AND THERE ARE SOME THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD BEFORE BY HIM. YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF, I BELIEVE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  I ASSURE YOU, THIS YOU CAN TAKE TO THE BANK."
ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00E5N8EPQ,5.0,"Released by Concord Records (who purchased Charles' label, ABC-Paramount ) in conjunction with the US Postal Service (who sold CDs of jazz and blues artists in the 1980s in conjunction with commemorative stamps)at the same time that a Charles \"Forever\" stamp was issued in September, this CD/DVD package is a must for Charles' fans and, hopefully, will make new ones.The label, and the USPS, picked the right person to produce this package.  Valerie Ervin is the President of the Ray Charles Foundation and had access to previously unissued recordings AND video! And though the CD only contains 12 tracks - and runs 47 minutes - this is probably the best \"picture\" of Charles breadth that I can think of. (Ok his \"country music\" covers are missing, but, what the heck!)Charles say in one of the interview clips on the DVD (more on that in a minute) that he didn't record \"jazz or blues or country or pop music\". He \"recorded music\", and that is obvious when you look at the track list. Yes, Leon Russell wrote, and recorded, \"A Song For You\", Shirley Jones sang \"\"Till There Was You\" in \"The Music Man\" and Frank Sinatra (and many others) recorded the Harold Arlen-penned \"Come Rain or Come Shine\", but none did it the way Charles does it here. And one previously released recording - Johnny Cash's hit \"Ring of Fire\" (penned by his wife June Carter along with Merle Kilgore) - was a revelation to me  And then there is the unreleased track - A 4:16 version of \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\". Marvelous!I mentioned the DVD included in the \"Deluxe package\" and I urge Charles fans to go for that. It's short - at 21 minutes - and, sadly, not indexed into chapters - and includes some rare footage of Charles in performance (along with that interview) chosen by Ervin.  The 12-page booklet enclosed spends two pages on ONE photo of Charles, four on listing the tracks with basic info in large print, and a nice two page essay (in tiny print) by Ervin.Charles was called \"The Genius\" by some, and I'm not one to question that. He's an American music icon and this tribute is fitting.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
A3DJWBKTF1PO7I,B00E5U1BH2,4.0,"Who can be other than charmed by Tim O'Brien in general.  What a big talent and great singer.  I had trouble warming to this duet, however, and I can't tell you why particularly.  My problem, probably, not his"
A2QYWB6UH4J7Q0,B00E5U1BH2,5.0,"Yes, it has been 13 years since Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott released \"Real Time,\" which to this day is one of my desert island albums.  Tim is the quintessential bluegrass singer, with a perfectly weathered voice, not to mention the ability to play anything with strings.  Darrell Scott's voice is a completely different kind of perfect, and while it may be less distinctive than Tim's, his instrumental prowess is on another level entirely.  The thing is, they can both do everything.  So, why bother putting them together?  Isn't that just a recipe for clashing egos and disaster?  \"Real Time\"  definitively answered that question.  When the two all-around geniuses are Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott, the results are epic.  Real Time was the perfect distillation of everything that is great about bluegrass, old-time and folk music.  I still get chills every time I hear their harmonizing, their perfectly restrained instrumental interplay without a single missing or extra note, and the raw emotion.And then they went their separate ways.  I remember going to their solo concerts, and with these types of artists, you can always chat with them after the show.  At Tim's shows, I begged him to record with Darrell again, and at Darrell's shows, I asked if he had anything going with Tim.  And I was never the only one.  Eventually, they gave in.  Last year, they put out some live recordings they had been sitting on.  Naturally, they were revelatory.  Somehow, Tim's voice gets even better with an audience, and when Darrell cuts loose on stage with that innovative guitar style he uses when there isn't a rhythm section around, the results lived up to expectations.  But I wanted some new material.  Finally, 13 years after Real Time, they have delivered.Remember the best restaurant you ever visited?  Remember the shock at how great it was?  Imagine going back after 13 years.  You know what's coming, so you don't quite get the joy of surprise, but you get the satisfaction of finally having that meal you've been craving for 13 years.  That's what this album is to me.  Some musicians just gel perfectly together.  That's Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott.  Compared to Real Time, the instrumental work is a bit flashier here.  That's fine by me, and they never overplay things.  In fact, Darrell's guitar work sounds more here like it does when he plays unaccompanied.  I love that style.  He has found the perfect way to compensate for the lack of a rhythm section, and it sounds like nobody else.  Nobody has a right to be that great a guitarist and that great a singer too.  And then there's Tim.  That gritty voice.  At this point, is there really anything left to say about how great it is?The only thing that has kept me going as I waited for this was my discovery of Cahalen Morrison and Eli West.  If you love the sound of Tim and Darrell, you NEED to check them out.  And of course, Tim's protege, Sarah Jarosz is making a nice career for herself. Now if we can just keep Tim and Darrell from waiting another 13 years, all will be good in the world of acoustic music."
A37NSW719W1HVV,B00E5U1BH2,5.0,"Who'd a thunk it?As a born rock and roller here, it blows me away how much I absolutely LOVE this recording!!  It simply BRINGS ME HOME.I've seen both O'Brien and Scott perform live (separately) at MerleFest here in North Carolina the year that Robert Plant and his Band Of Joy closed the show ... and I was impressed even then of the musical talents these two guys possess.  I was spellbound by each when they performed!This recording is a treasure and something that I will indeed play over and over and over ...I highly recommend it to anyone out there who digs mountain music that paints an aural picture of sitting on the front / back porch of a log cabin high in the hills with two acoustic guitars playing in perfect sync with each other and two voices that blend as perfectly as pancakes and syrup (with bacon on the side)!Believe me, people ... it's just THAT good!!"
A3FFTZ51UPNQ7N,B00E5U1BH2,5.0,"A wonderful collection of songs by two masters. Tim and Darrell's voices blend together as well as any of the great brother singing duos. The original songs are memorable as are the well chosen covers of songs written by George Jones, Hank Williams and John Prine. \"Keep Your Dirty Lights On\", \"Brother Wind\", and \"Time to Talk to Joseph\" are highlights. And I find myself listening again and again to the haunting \"Angel's Blue Eyes\", a finely crafted tune with beautiful harmonies and evocative lyrics."
A98VV99UNXXC9,B00E5XLZM0,5.0,Ty Segall and Charlie Moonheart & co. are destroying on this LP. I love most of Segall's previous work (really like the rest) and the Charlie & The Moonhearts LP is fantastic (try the Goner Records website or call the store for mail-order.) Ty is stretching in new and interesting directions lately and I can't wait for both of their upcoming work.
A19NL44TIQGYD1,B00E5XLZM0,5.0,Fuzz is right up my alley. Loved those old psychedelic heavy riffing bands from the past. Fuzz continues this tradition.
A19BCQ4XOAM091,B00E687GPO,5.0,"I'm a big Five for Fighting fan, and this album did not disappoint!  The album as a whole is great, and I especially enjoy &#34;Stand Up,&#34; &#34;What If,&#34; and &#34;You'll Never Change.&#34;  I'm also really enjoying &#34;Symphony Lane,&#34; which is a rather different song and has some very cool lyrics.  Slice is one of my all time favorite albums, but I may even ultimately like Bookmarks even more.  Every time I listen to it, my enjoyment of it grows."
AOLLKB79KF6P,B00E688DXI,5.0,"This album is quite simply brilliant!!! If there is a better album opener than &#34;Pleasure and Pain&#34; then I haven't heard it yet, while listening to this album I have heard elements of Disturbed, Tool, Bullet for my Valentine but at the same time they have a sound that is all their own.I am a massive rock and metal fan with a CD collection of well over 1100 albums, but this album has been on continuous rotation since I bought it a month ago and it is still awesome.If you like well written, head banging melodic metal then do yourself a favour and check these guys out, I guarantee you will love it!!"
AHZPUCAVRV4IT,B00E688KA4,4.0,"What made Tyr unique was the richness of their background and the light their songs shed upon the northern world. When How Far To Asgaard came out there were already many Viking metal bands exploiting the rich history and mythology of the icy seas, but almost none that actually taught you any thing you didn't know or sounded authentic. Tyr was real.Even more so than Beyond the Light of The Northern Star this is the epic stripped to its bare bones. Valkyrja is short, trim, and tight, with almost no interesting drum parts. Without a doubt I think the band should find a drummer to bring into the fold. There is a giant sized hole in their music right now, and though the other band members are trying their best to up their games and produce polished work, it just isn't feeling right any longer. I didn't buy Lay of Thrym. I may not buy their next album, if this trend continues. They have rowed far away from what made them great. They are lost at sea and need to chart a new direction."
A2JBJ0ZC98DE7B,B00E6890RG,4.0,"After legendary releases with Aquarius and Visions I was expecting something equally as legendary from Haken.  And while this album is quite amazing, I'm giving it 4 stars because it isn't at the same level as their previous two albums.  Maybe it's not fair to compare an album to past releases, especially when the two previous releases were in my mind two of the top 10 albums ever made.  But there are a few reasons I give this album a 4.25/5 instead of 4.5 or up.The down part of this album for me was that they seem to have veered away from the heavy guitar-dominated songs of the previous albums.  Not that I don't like the keyboard, but I was left wanting more from the 8-string and 7-string guitars they play.  The other thing I noticed was that this album is a bit more progressive than I am accustomed to.  On first listen I was pretty disappointed.  It has since grown on me and I listen to it all the time.  But I can take songs from Aquarius and Visions and play them for my non-musically minded friends and say &#34;see isn't this song bad ass.&#34;  I don't think I could get away with that with anything from the Mountain.  Maybe In Memoriam, which is pretty catchy.  But a song like Cockroach King, while I like it now, is a bit too prog in my humble opinion.The high point of the album is Falling Back to Earth, which you'll really get into after a few listens.  For any fan of prog rock this album is a must have.  But don't be expecting another Visions.  Maybe the bar was set too high after that release.  Happy progging."
A1W8KJ8HAAM2NR,B00E6890RG,5.0,"I loved Visions and one thing I can say about this band is that they are consistent. Where as a lot of prog bands are playing the same stuff they are progressing. High points for me Atlas Stone, In Memoriam, Because it's there, Pareidolia."
A2MM5RMCXOSGAE,B00E6890VC,5.0,"This album is awesome. It's rare that I come across a band that's released an album where I love every track on it. Well, congratulations Chvrches, you've succeeded. I LOVE them and highly suggest you purchase their music."
A221IPSU8SL2D3,B00E6890VC,4.0,"I can't stop listening to &#34;The Bones Of What You Believe&#34; by Chvrches, and judging by the other reviews of this record, many people seem to have the same reaction.  There were only a couple of songs that didn't grab me like the others did.  Most of the songs have insightful lyrics and excellent music.  Some standout songs are &#34;The Mother We Share,&#34; &#34;Gun,&#34; &#34;Tether,&#34; &#34;Recover,&#34; and &#34;Night Sky.&#34;  You should definitely check this out if you like electronic pop with female vocals."
A15YUGRU85XUJF,B00E6894FY,5.0,"Alvin has been one of my favorite guitarists from the 1st day I heard him over 30 years ago. It's a sad shame that he died the way he did, with so much life left in him. This is a Great album and we are very lucky that it was produced. If your a fan of Alvins you will not be dissapointed."
A2S0TMR69SMGC8,B00E6894FY,5.0,Seemed like the CD was not up to his normally great standard; felt like he would not have encouraged release if still with us.  Disappointing sums it up for me.
AVH28SA2CH54N,B00E6F11NA,5.0,Really enjoying this new STD album. Have listened to it about 5 times since I got it last week and it gets better with each listen.
A2HUN5Q1TA5CNF,B00E6G21EW,3.0,"This is the umpteenth time these wonderful recordings have been repackaged. As I said in the title of this review, it's a great value for a great price, and the song selection is pretty good, but this is far from the best Everly Brothers compilation available, and in my never-to-be humbled opinion it doesn't really allow the listener to here the full range of what Phil and Don were capable of, and it certainly doesn't cover their entire career. If you are looking for the best (and the cheapest) way to get the very best of the Everly Brothers without tracking down their individual CDs I suggest you pick up \"The Complete Cadence Recordings 1957-1960\", \"Walk Right Back: The Everly Brothers On Warner Brothers 1960-1969\", \"Stories We Could Tell: The RCA Years\" or the twofer \"Stories We Could Tell/Pass The Chicken And Listen\", and \"The Mercury Years\" CDs to get a complete overview of Phil and Don's recording career from it's beginning in the mid 50's to their final album for Mercury records \"Some Hearts\" in 1989. Also, grab a copy of \"The Very Best Of The Everly Brothers\" released on WB in 1964 for some re-recorded songs from the Cadence years. Yes you'll spend about three times as much as you would if you bought this collection, but you'll get about five or six times the amount of music, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect if you decide to pick up their entire back catalog. I hope you've found this review helpful and informative. Thanks for reading. PS The Everly Brothers 4CD box set \"Heartaches & Harmonies\" and the three catalog box sets from Bear Family will give you everything that the Everly brothers recorded from 1951 to 1972, but you'd be looking at a price tag of about $800.00 for all of those."
A33VHMM19VWLV2,B00E7NIMZ6,5.0,"The music is perfect for the picture, but better yet, is very enjoyable listening.  Great instrumental rock, and the CD includes almost all of the great 70's vocals.  Herr Zimmer has been a busy fellow this year.  This is a great job!"
AR5UAL7LBZ07A,B00E7NIUGC,5.0,"Although not quite as 'hooky' as Bad Decisions, this release explores more of a roots of rock. I picked up influences of The Doors and BTO. I dig the hippie vibe and recommend this release to anyone that remotely appreciates TLV."
A1STTJIQ3W8F7S,B00E7NIYQ8,5.0,it is fun & delightful. I am a big fan of straight no chaser!! I was not disappointed in any way!! you will enjoy it too!! they do nice arrangements for Christmas music & sing so very well together. there's nothing not to like!! happy listening!
A1ERO8H50AOYUR,B00E7Z7D2M,5.0,"I am a huge Robert Glasper fan, thanks to your truly.  The music in clear, classic, and the guest artist are some of my favorite in the business.  I can't get enough of listening to this."
AYN0075O6VW0W,B00E7Z7D2M,4.0,I heard a lot about the second installment of Black Radio and I was not disappointed in it at all.
A3M459NLAT69P8,B00E89VXQY,4.0,"A great live album but one glaring omission, Through the Never, the song in which the film (soundtrack) is named after in not included...hmmm"
A2D1UD6WYNRU55,B00E89VXQY,5.0,Metallica always brings it live. I have seen them twice and they will blow anyone off the stage. The soundtrack is awesome and I cant wait to see the movie. Keep it up Metallica.
A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B00E89VXQY,5.0,"I was wondering to myself how to do this review of this Metallica live CD, and choice to do it this way a track by track summery, then my whole summery at the end of the review.  The CD is divided into two CD'S and is 16 songs.  CD one is all live tracks, and CD two is 7 live tracks and one classic song from the Master of Puppets album.Track One: Classic Opening song for any Metallica concert has a great feel to it and enjoy the audience singing along.Track Two: Creeping Death great song to open the set with and one of my personal favorites of the band what made it even better was audience so into it singing with James on the chorus die, die, die....amazing voice sounding.Track Three: For Whom the Bell Tolls another classic Metallica song and great echo effect on the song, makes you feel like your really at the concert.Track Four: Fuel good song and amazing engery from James and the audience just interacting together very powerful stuff.Track Five: Ride the Lightning great flashback song and also good music from a good album, just a minor setback with the mic acting up on James fading out then coming back strong, you could tell James voice is much clear and makes for an amazing concert sound quality wise.Track Six: Great intro to a classic song One and video that started Metallica's video libary. You can actually hear the gun fire and bombs going off as the airplane drops them.  For sure a powerful song and lyrics wise, and savor the audience humming along with James.Track Seven: James shows his humor side by telling the fans he sometimes forgets the lyrics so needs help from them on this song The Memory Remains.  One of Favorites also of Metallica's lineup.  What did it for me was the auidence ending to this song with the humming and clapping along with James.Track Eight: Wherever I May Roam just a great song and the echo effect makes you feel like your there.CD 2Track One: Cyanide great song off the last album the guitar workings and drums truly mind blowing effectsTrack Two: And Justice for All was played a little different guitar wise and any true Metallica fan can hear the difference in the song, they slow it down just a little bit in certain parts.  But still blows you away hearing it.Track Three: Mater of Puppets The Jewel of the libary of Metallica one of the songs I enjoy singing along to every time I hear it.  They use the echo effect again on this song and stunning vocals again, the ending great with James laughing and crowd going wild.Track Four: Starts with a pop going off like a firework, Battery you feel need to sing along and enjoy the part of James going \"are you alive\" then waits and says \"then show me\".Track Five: One of Personal favorite's from this Live CD Noting Else Matters with great intro to it, and a song I almost know every lryic to and sings along with it each time I hear it.Track Six: Enter Sandman another intro pop like fireworks, then the start the song and great sound effects until the Amp makes a big pop and injuries two fans but they not serious hurt and concert continues.  You can honestly tell James voice is back for good.Track Seven:  Hit the Lights they get new amps up onto stage and James jokes with the auidence \"this is what it is like in our garage...reminds me of Kill Them All\" then goes into the last live song you can tell the auidence is just thrilled and amped for the show.  Makes you just want to bang your head to the song.Track Eight: Orion is on here but to the trained Metallica Fan it sounds a tad different to the original song but still a great song and music.Summery: I shall state the facts no songs from St. Anger and Load but oh well still a great live CD and proves James and the crew are still here and still kicking it with the best of the them.  The song lineup is great and brings back great memories of great music by an amazing metal rock band.  As stated earlier you can hear the differences in some of the songs played lived compare to the orginal versions but so what still makes you want to bang your head and makes you feel like your there with the sound quality.  One of the best live albums I have ever heard in my lifetime.  Only two issues in the concert with Ride the Lightning with the mic fading out, and Enter Sandman with the amp poping and fans getting hurt.  But still I am fan of Metallica they are my favorite band and forever shall be."
A2RCCTCXKW52DH,B00E89VXQY,5.0,bought for my 16 year daughter their music appeals to many age groups may they keep on rockin enter sandman at yankee stadium was excellent
A1F7AFVBKHSOT8,B00E89VXQY,4.0,"It has been about 20 years since Metallica has released a proper live album.  Yes, you can get copies of any show they play through their website, however the soundboard recordings sound a lot different than this well mixed live album that is coming out in support of their new movie.The classic Metallica opening of Ennio Morricone's \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" is here, complete with building insanity of the crowd \"singing\" along to the instrumental.  With the introduction over, Metallica proceeds to launch into Creeping Death and slam through a 15 song set with deeper cuts than you would imagine off a live album, especially one supporting a movie.  \"Ride the Lightning,\" is played along with the epic \"And Justice for all.\"Metallica sounds invigorated through the entire show, every song seemingly louder and faster than the last.  Hetfield's voice, which can be shaky at times during live shows is strong throughout the album.  And if that has been done through post production it doesn't show.  It just sounds like he is putting on the show of a lifetime.There are some odd choices in the set list.  It's almost shocking not to see crowd favorites like Seek and Destroy or Sad but True on the album as they both seem like vital pieces of a Live Metallica experience.  What is there is great however and there is the added benefit of hearing new versions of songs that are not often played.As a pure value proposition, it is hard to argue for 9.99 you aren't getting a lot of bang for your buck, especially if you like or have even had a passing interest in Metallica."
A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00E89VXQY,4.0,"Metallica Through the Never is a good album with a technical flaw.The tracks chosen are some of the most popular Metallica tracks, along with some tracks that don't always appear on live albums (Orion, I'm looking at you).You've heard these songs a million times over the years. You probably don't need to own them live again, but honestly, with the addition of Rob to the band, the tracks definitely have a different (neither better nor worse, just different) feel to me than with Jason on the bass.I am surprised that there is only a single live track for the latest album, Death Magnetic. I had expected at least another track, but it just goes to show that the tracks chosen for this motion picture really pluck from every album and every era. Definitely a great selection over all.The technical issue is dynamic range compression and mastering the levels at the limit. What happens is you will hear some distortion in the music, which someone that doesn't have a trained ear might just mistake as distortion because they were playing so loud. I think that's the effect they were going for, which is why I gave the disc 4 stars."
A7AWAIVOA1IVR,B00E8ODSUS,5.0,I have been a UFO fan since the age of 15.  From No Heavy Petting to the current Seven Deadly there has always been somethng unique about the hard rockin' sound of UFO.  Hot N Live brngs back this memories as it is a chornology of the bands's music from their beginnng until 1983.  The musicianship is exceptional and the sound quality is great.  If you are a UFO fan you will not be disappointed.Roll Tide777
A286EDV953ZZJT,B00E8ODSUS,5.0,"Stellar!  This is a good package to acquire this sample of previously disparately released material with Schenker.  The second disc with Paul Chapman, with the previously unreleased show, is the main reason to get this.  If the only live UFO you have is Strangers, then this is a no-brainer!"
A1YTMTQRFQ4B7F,B00E8RVSM0,5.0,"This ENTIRE cd has been on repeat.... because EVERY song is amazing....powerful....and saturated in worship. I loved this, I had never heard of this couple before but just listening to the way they love God together and flow in worship makes me know they were destined to be together. You will LOVE it!"
A2YA2473TI3MIO,B00E95ED32,5.0,This is a rather new group from what I can tell.  I was a little surprised that I like it.  Of course the cute young singer was a joy to look at.  So I purchased this album.  Will I buy anymore.  Still not sure.  Still feeling out what I think of this group.  Surely something different from my normal which of course I like.
A1QR9CS347XKFC,B00E95ED32,4.0,"Avicii taps the zeitgeist-y sound of EDM and fuses it together with country, pop, and elements of dubstep. Nearly every song has high replay value. Worth having."
AHIM7P69WQ814,B00E95ED32,4.0,"Avicii's been knocking around the European club scene awhile so for those in the dance know he's not a new entity. This however, is his first full length collection of new tracks. All have a common theme of a strummy guitar slow build up to mostly upbeat chorus. Think if Philip Phillips got remixed. Though I hesitate to call these dance, more like snap happy pop with a folk backbeat. Nonetheless it's still good, listenable radio music that will probably cross-over to used in commercial music. Not life changing but still fun to hear."
A25QXWTEABEZ4R,B00E95ED32,5.0,Seen the one video and loved it.  Got the CD and it is like the video.  Would get it again.
ADYOW1TEN2M1,B00E95ED32,5.0,"I was never a big an electro dance pop person but I fell in Love with \"Wake Me Up\" so I purchased Avicii's new album. I received my \"True\" album today and I can't stop playing this terrific album. In fact, I think that I'll get a second one to have one at home and one in my car. Here's how I rated the tracks:Wake Me Up = 10You Make Me = 8Hey Brother = 10Addicted To You = 10Dear Boy = 8.5Liar, Liar = 9.5Shame On Me = 10Lay Me Down = 10Hope There's Someone = 10Heart On My Sleeve = 10If you haven't bought the album yet, I highly recommend \"True\". It's a great mix of varied songs and styles."
A2EWVR2XVQJ0L4,B00E95ED32,4.0,"I of course bought this album because of &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; and I was kinda expecting every song to catch me like that one did, but the other ones took a little more time to grown on me.  A decent electronic album."
A1W7S72B8SRGNM,B00E95ED32,5.0,this cd is everything that i expected and more. it was a great deal and worth every penny that it cost
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00E9E0NQO,5.0,"Remember when Jim Carey was in &#34;The Mask&#34; and kept saying, &#34;Smokin'!&#34;  That's what I think when I listen to Paul Speer's excellent CD.  The set literally explodes with the opening track &#34;Contents Under Pressure.&#34;  The guitar riffs run up the scale with a throbbing, somewhat sinister lead guitar lick on the rock mix  Speer takes the same song on track 8 but does it with a techno mix, more throbbing virtuosity.  &#34;Powerglide&#34; is another strong track with the throbbing techno beat and a searing electric lead that rips through the track which goes from ignited to incendiary about midway through the track.  &#34;Megatron&#34; also smokes, running at a gallop with a repetitive bass line that sounds like a high-powered gym workout laid against Speer's searing lead guitar.  &#34;Vortex&#34; and &#34;Helion Prime&#34; are also excellent tracks.  This is high-energy instrumental rock at its best.  Enjoy!"
A2R35DE00SQDJQ,B00E9E0NQO,5.0,"Although the title Ax Inferno, may conjure a variety of images in the reader's mind, \"ax\" as it is used in this context, is a slang term for an electric guitar. And this new release by Grammy nominated and Emmy winning guitar virtuoso, Paul Speer, is quite incendiary, and does indeed kick some serious ax. On this album, the blend of rock guitar with techno and electronica lives up to its fiery moniker. This is not music for yoga or chilling out to with a glass of chardonnay.  However, put it on while you are cruising down the highway, and you'll be good to go. Just be sure to keep an eye on the speedometer once the adrenalin gets flowing. And the juices do flow as Paul puts the hammer down on the opening track called \"Contents Under Pressure (Rock Mix).\" Paul continues to keep the pedal to the metal on track 2, \"Accelerator (Rock Mix), as a fat sounding analog synth arpeggiator pattern lays down a pulsing groove with drummer Ron Krasinski pushing it to the max.It's clear right from the start that this album is going to be an electric guitar magnum opus - and it is. I particularly like how the guitar adds a more organic and live element to the programmed synths, sequences, and samples. While still having electronic elements, a song called \"Powerglide,\" cooks with a dash of funk, including some soulful organ sounds and smoldering lead guitar. A little of that vibe carries over into the next song entitled \"Megatron,\" with its driving mid tempo beat and bluesy rock fusion guitar solos that brought to mind the legendary guitar work of Jeff Beck and Ronnie Montrose at times.As the album title implies, Ax Inferno brings the heat. Being a guitarist myself I have a special appreciation, not only for Paul's masterful playing but for the incredible tones he is able to coax out of his instrument. Ax Inferno burns with creative fire and illuminates the contrast of futuristic high tech music and soul searing electric guitar. While Paul Speer has always been an innovator, his latest release finds him exploring exciting new sonic frontiers."
A2TWT7ZPBBYZYF,B00E9E0NQO,5.0,"Ax Inferno is right, because this guy's on fire!Speer's fourth independent and fourteenth overall commercial release is my first encounter with the Emmy Award-winning, Grammy Award-nominated guitarist, who has immediately skyrocketed into the upper echelon of my favorite six-string slingers, including Andy Summers, Eric Johnson, Hiram Bullock, and Mike Moreno.In addition to unleashing fiery, scorching guitars, Speer plays bass and keyboards, and Ron Krasinski plays pulse-pounding drums on four tracks.What elevates Speer into the stratosphere of awesome guitarists is that he is more than simply an exceptional, virtuosic soloist. Sure, he can shred with the best of them (I would put him on the level of Eddie Van Halen), but he also sculpts beautiful, mesmerizing, atmospheric sonic textures. But when he lets loose, boy does he let loose.Speer is also an excellent bass and keyboard player, belting out dynamic, thumping low frequencies and synthesizing dreamy, edgy washes of sound, as well as some techno beats.What holds everything together is the structural integrity of the compositions. More than simply a platform for Speer's electric flights of fancy, the songs live and breathe with a beginning, middle, and end anchored by melodic and rhythmic grooves.This is an essential recording for electric guitar enthusiasts."
A1FJQFAYC17JP6,B00E9E4EC8,4.0,"I'm not particularly fond of Bluegrass but do like Alan Jackson.  I thought this album was nice but not really a standout.  Nevertheless, folks who like Alan will like it."
A3TL2V4EOOMKX5,B00E9E4EC8,5.0,For those you like bluegrass and country you can&#34;t go wrong with this CD. Alan Jackson is one of the few real country singers left ! Buy this Cd
A2WVNK47TV30GT,B00E9E4EC8,5.0,hey thanks again for having this cd.  we really enjoy our music and amazon always has what we are looking for with prompt delievery.
AA47I2VBI4NY6,B00E9E4EC8,5.0,"Great addition to my collection of Alan Jackson music. Usually a traditional country artist, this venture into bluegrass finds him comfortable in this format. The music has a great beat, good accompaniment for walking."
AZ3IZYNW8238T,B00E9E4EC8,5.0,"Was a good group of songs that was well put together.  I Really like it, great singer of course!  :)"
A26X43UGIGJZNR,B00E9E4EC8,5.0,"If you love great lyrics, Acoustic music, and silky smooth vocals, this album is a must have. As a long time bluegrass and country music fan, this is the best of both worlds. I gave it five stars only because there was not a sixth star to give."
AAUQDL5ZNN040,B00E9E4EC8,4.0,I am an Alan Jackson fan and love any and all the music he does. Also enjoy bluegrass music; great sound!
A1ZWYAV79Z6Y3Q,B00E9E4EC8,4.0,"I Love Alan Jackson's singing, but Blue Grass is not my favorite type of music.  It was quite good tho because Alan did it, but I couldn't say I \"love\"  the music.  It's really good tho, but I can't say I \"love\" it, I just \"like\" it !"
ALAJL3S09HBS7,B00E9HG1NK,3.0,"Beethoven had every right to make the same comment that Nietzsche made of himself: I am dynamite. His address - understood as both trajectory and target - can only be described as prophetic. When I am next in the Sistine Chapel, I expect to see that Michelangelo has allocated a spandrel to him beside the likes of Amos, Ezekiel and Isaiah.Here in Janson's cycle of the symphonies, zeitgeist has prevailed again. Our society is deeply suspicious of big, heroic gestures. Admittedly, they were the undoing of so many in the Twentieth Century. Metaphysics stinks in a pluralist, secular society. In response, the likes of Zinman, Abbado (thrice!!!) and Rattle serve up a sleek, energetic, eco-friendly Beethoven where there is no moral imperative in the slipstream to change one's life or cross the Alps with Bonaparte. Add Janssons to their ranks. This cycle is beautifully played (even if there is no extra torque at key junctures). Recording-wise, it is astounding. The fizzer of a Ninth aside, I enjoy it. It's nice and dramatic. Outside these parameters, it means nothing. Here today and gone thereafter with no resonance. It should be increasingly hard to listen to the Eroica as one ages and dies as a liegeman of suburbia. Here, depressingly, is another exception to the rule. Perhaps Happy Acres can play it over the public-address system to gee up the old buggers, aplay at bingo.Consider this. Furtwangler's Beethoven 9th from 1942 is a conflagration of suns; the last two movements of Uncle Otto's Beethoven Fourth from 1958 are the `barbaric yamp' of legend; the Fifth from `Karajan in Moscow' is reparation for Barbarossa. Antediluvian though I be, I want a Beethoven who tells me to live big; fight hard; love hotly; hate heatedly and rejoice exceedingly. A decaffeinated, carbon-neutral, fat-free Beethoven is ear-candy and that's about it.In closing, one has to make reference to the contemporary works that spice this cycle. Assuredly, I am not the man to appreciate them. Shakespeare might say that while Beethoven bestrides the world like a colossus (or at least he did in the days of yore), these lesser creations walk under his huge legs and peep about to find themselves graves of sorts.Why waste what little time you have left on such trinkets and beads of glass? The Real awaits you!"
A19TN7UDB5JNHE,B00E9LL4UG,4.0,"I thought I was pre-ordering her latest album and it is just the single, &#34;Applause.&#34;  I love Lady Gaga's music but rather disappointed to find out that I was not ordering the entire album.  I do love the single &#34;Applause&#34; but I rather had the entire album than just the single."
A3BGDHFN4GWQPF,B00E9P957Q,5.0,"They are straight-ahead ROCKERS now, which suits me fine. Also, the band's virtuoso playing is more noticeable in 5-minute rockers than the former 10-15 minute space jams. The sound quality on these 1989-2007 albums is pristine, as all have been remastered. The big &#34;catch&#34; here is the remixed 2002 album &#34;Vapor Trails&#34; which sounds so much better than before."
A206LLXABNR9I0,B00E9P959E,5.0,"I was a fan of the album upon release, but like many others the poor production quality greatly limited my overall enjoyment of the recording.  Bottrill's treatment of the album, essentially given free license to remix as he wanted, is a breath of fresh air.  Clarity in sonic quality along with some interesting vocal and guitar choices (he often uses different takes than what appeared on the original release).  This is win/win for any Rush fan, and will likely refresh interest in the casual rock music listener."
A2NVQM5H3RS1SL,B00E9P959E,5.0,"This remix only serves to emphasize how bad the original mix was.  I'm simply stunned by how much detail was buried originally....It's hard to believe that all those guitar parts and vocal tracks were there all along.  Did you know that Ceiling Unlimited had a guitar solo in it?  Me neither, until now."
A2WQF0QROK09AT,B00E9P959E,4.0,"After waiting years for this remix, I didn't hesitate to buy it -- and immediately listen to the old version until it arrived, for back-to-back comparison.VAPOR TRAILS always did have an air of being not quite so finished an album as, say, MOVING PICTURES; the over-saturation and muddiness gave it more of a garage-band feel that sorta fit the circumstances to which it had been born.This remix still sounds a little unfinished -- &#34;Healing Touch&#34; particularly sounds like it needs a bit more arranging -- but it's a lot more polished, which better reveals the flaws even as it adds shine. So it isn't &#34;the same but better&#34; -- it's &#34;almost the same and shinier&#34;. Where the original mix was fairly democratic, this remix isn't afraid to make choices and push them forward: the lead vocal over the harmonies, the bass over the guitars, the higher drums over the lower.As a result, Geddy's voice no longer sounds like he's competing with his own overdubs to be heard, and his always-surprising bass-playing is much more audible. Alex's guitar tends not to be quite so loud or dark, subtly changing texture & dynamics on a few songs.Bottom line: it's great to have VAPOR TRAILS cleaned up, and only time will show if I don't come to prefer the subtle differences heard here."
A3PB9CMXX1VTUY,B00E9P959E,5.0,"I am very glad to hear this new remixed of this album, the sound is more clear and the songs looks like anew song. You can hear with clarity the guitars, bass, voices."
A2MK609WAGZSEO,B00E9P959E,5.0,"I am not an audiophile who can tell what hand the recording studio sound technician used when he mixed the album. However, I think this gives me some strength as a reviewer since I am seeking what the average listener seeks.Vapor Trails is one of my favorite albums; if I were listening to the CD I would have worn it out by now. The album was not perfect, but certainly an important development in Rush's discography.Vapor Trails Remixed is better. The original album contained a \"wall of sound\" approach which tended to  hold it back. Even if you liked Rush cranked up, there was a certain muddle to the album. The remixed version dials back that auditory assault and cleans it up. There is \"space\" inbetween the various elements that adds a cleaner, somewhat more spare sound to the album. Rush sounds more classically Rush. The Power Trio's individual contributions stand out more on their own.The songs you liked a lot, you will like more; the songs you sort of liked, you will like a little more."
AHAKXX5K1S3H0,B00E9P959E,4.0,When I got this i was expecting a gate fold with tons of artwork from the album but instead the two vinyl lp came in a flimsy album cover that when you take the records out it is so thin it is like paper WOW.  I expected more from Rush since they came from the hay day of vinyl records...
A3EC1CRC96VKLL,B00E9P959E,5.0,Sounds SO much better than the muddy original.  Shouldn't Rush give a free copy to all the people who bought the original?  LOL
A2FBJK2NDAD5M0,B00E9P959E,5.0,"I must say that I have a new appreciation of this disc after hearing it remixed.  It certainly brings out the songs more and shows it not to be the &#60; stellar album I thought it to be at first.  Don't get me wrong; it's Rush so it'll never be bad, but I didn't think it as good as I expected when it came out & I think some others felt the same way.  Hopefully, everyone else who thought that will give this one a listen & reevaluate it."
A3BZD2Z91QCEUC,B00EBC0WPQ,3.0,"I had never listened to Gungor and took a chance on this album. I really enjoyed the songs like &#34;Beat of Her Heart&#34; and &#34;God & Country&#34;, but there tends to be a lot of super poppy/ electronic songs that I am not crazy about. I enjoyed the lyrics on most of the songs. Apparently they are a Christian Group and people want to slam them for not making this a worship album (lot of lyrical criticism), but I enjoyed the images the lead singer explores with his words."
A1MH9QQHD9R4H0,B00EBDXRKW,5.0,"I too, am in the family of  prefering the older traditional country style and lyrics. Randy is the epitome of that style. He shines like a brand new penny on eveyone of these songs. As Linda said , \"even does them better than the orginal artist\". It's hard to choose a particular favorite or two, since every cut has its own special impact. But my favorites are \"My Mary\", Saginaw Michigan\",' Always On A Mountan When I Fall\", \"What Have you Planned Tonight Diana\" \"Ever Changing Woman\" and the surpising \"Pennies From Heaven.The fact that Randy choose to use his own traveling band in the studio on this makes the album even that much more enjoyable. He has a superb group of talented musicians. I have always wanted Randy to do an album like this of older material. With his own band members on the strumentals. I'm happy as a lark that he finally has. This is an album that I will play repeatedly. The song selection and Randy's understated delivery on them  makes  every song felt in your very soul. Not an album you are going to put aside easily."
A12FLBGHU3SSJ9,B00EBDXRKW,5.0,"As a lifelong fan from England, UK, I'm always excited by a new RT release.This is a wonderful collection of classic country songs from artists like Merle and Lefty, people that Randy has taken influence from over the years. Randy is in excellent vocal shape and the recording is in his early style of crisp vocal up front and instruments behind.My favourite tracks include What Have You Got Planned Tonight Diana, a beautiful version of this ballad, Ever Changing Woman and that great hook \"Sometimes she's hotter than the thirty-first of August, and colder than a February morn\". I've always liked the classic country of Lefty Frizzell and it is as if they read my mind because I've always thought Saginaw Michigan would be perfect for RT.The final track is the Joe Nichols duet, a tribute to George Jones \"Tonight I'm Playin' Possum\" and it is just a brilliantly crafted song from the lyrics to the melody.It's been a tough 2 years but Randy is back in fine shape.Continue to get well Randy."
A1ILI67JXIBD0A,B00EBDXRKW,5.0,It was really nice having Randy back again.  I loved the CD & will keep watching for anymore new ones.  Great CD Randy.
A2H0H5NAO76R5E,B00EBDXRKW,5.0,"I knew 7 of these songs as covers/originals by Merle Haggard, and 1 by George Jones and 1 by Lefty Frizzell.  I am usually of the mindset that if you cannot top an original (or at least come close), then you should leave the song alone.  I'm always on a mountain when I fall and Saginaw, Michigan fit into this category for me.  On the other songs, Randy gives the originals a run for their money.  Thank God for artists of today who recognize those who came before them.  One of the ways that I can usually tell if I'm going to like a country artist from the last 20 years is if they have at least one tribute album.  Good luck to Randy for a full recovery."
A2RD6GZES9XFEK,B00EBDXXKG,5.0,"Polvo is one of my top bands of all time forever and ever. I love this new offering from them, I hope they are going to continue making music together for years to come!"
A1AL15PY5AVFNX,B00EBDXXKG,5.0,"6th album from North Carolina band&#8212;solid, edgy indie guitar rock that rides a fine line between melody and terse, angulardelivery.  The songs are meticulously aggressive, stirring emotions with the balance of opposites: anger vs beauty, controlvs explosiveness, math rock tempo vs liquid riff flows.  The production has an immaculately clean fuzz-roar that lays a heavyhand on the tunes.  The level of musicianship is at an all-time high for the band; songwriting, bass, drums and the brilliantlyinnovative guitar lines are all tenaciously crisp with an inviting muscularity.  Members have played in Helium, Libraness, IdyllSwords.  Includes some guest guitar from Mitch Easter.  At times I hear influences like Built To Spill, Pinback, Seam, ArchersOf Loaf, Slint, Squirrel Bait, The Entrance Band, XTC, even Neil Young/Crazy Horse & the Rolling Stones.  This is the kind ofalbum that reveals additional layers and depth to the sound with every listen and never loses touch with its rock &#8216;n&#8217; rollcore.  --Excellent--"
A1EQRCSV98E4PI,B00EBDXYL4,5.0,Great collection of songs I should have already owned but now I have them. Loading on my ipod. I going to have to get another ipod
A37A966YQRGRL4,B00EBJ624O,5.0,"Yuja Wang has captured everyone's attention with her terrific technique.  In this performance she does two killer concerti on the same concert.  She wins!  Gustavo Dudamel is also in fine shape with the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra, and his personal excitement is obvious from the electrifying final bars of the Rachmaninoff, in particular.  Immensely enjoyable."
AXU5L8LYHPWQI,B00EBJ64HE,3.0,"A reliable critic praised the live concert from which this set came very highly.  Maybe the atmosphere of the occasion made for an experience the recording doesn't capture.  The Met Orchestra lives up to its fine reputation, the Wagner is, as expected, spot on.The Beethoven Piano Concerto 4, with Kissin, is also fiine.  However, Schubert's Ninth seems to drag on and is not, for this purchaser, a keeper.  Maybe the excellent Met Orchestra doesn't play much Schubert."
A3HPZDM1ST71XT,B00EBJ64JC,5.0,I love the album....Brett is such a refreshing artist.  Love his music and his voice.  Get it if you are a fan.
AG74WADVVCCKD,B00EBJ65MS,5.0,Beautiful voice singing beautiful songs. I love me some MJ Blige. Her voice can be powerful or soft as cotton. Two thumbs up on this purchase.
A36XCCLA93FXR1,B00EBJ65MS,5.0,I saw the Mary J Christmas special on TV and I knew I had to add this to my collection of Christmas CD&#34;S Mary sings her heart out
A37MGUBTKRLC13,B00EBJ65MS,4.0,This CD is a must buy for the holidays! I promise you will not get enough of it.  It's not even Christmas time yet and I am ready to put up the tree!  Mary does an excellent job on ALL the selections.  Her range and control of the each song is incredible.  I so happy I did not prejudge this project.  I love music and I love the Lord and Mary has delivered in a very spiritual and excellent way.
A3ETQGCOAZEZX8,B00EBJ65MS,4.0,I will continue to play this CD throughout the Christmas season.  I saw her give a live performance on either OVC or HSN.  That caused me to buy the CD.
A24EXRGZ24WZ22,B00EBJ65MS,5.0,"I have to say that when I heard she was doing a Christmas album I was a bit nervous. I didn't think it would go over well, but Im happy to say that the Queen still reigns!! She did it on all the songs on this album and I have to say hearing her speak another language on a track was refreshing and she did it absolutely beautifully. I also love that Mary stepped out of her \"Hip Hop box\" and dabbled in different genres and they all worked for her (Latin, Italian, Pop, Jazz, Classic Jazz and R&B;) It reminded me of her \"Mary\" album which was Adult Contemporary.  Miss Blige has been in the business for over 20 years and still proving that she is not slowing down for anyone, Im excited for 2014! Top 5:1. Petit Noel Papa - This is the song that she sings in Spanish and she sounds stunning... flawless actually.2. Do You Hear What I Hear - Mary and Jessie J sound AMAZING together! What an awesome pairing!3. The Christmas Song - This is my favorite Christmas song of all time and Mary doesn't disappoint!4. Noche De Paz - Mary with Marc Anthony - Excellent ending to this fantastic album!5. Little Drummer Boy - Ive never really cared for this song in general but Mary made me love her version!!"
A2WLT2JC9DALRK,B00EBJ65MS,5.0,I kept this cd in my car rotation far after the holidays because it's that good. She out did herself on this one.
A29YK82GBM9QRB,B00EBJ65MS,4.0,"This , I believe, is Mary's first Christmas album and it's a knockout! Her arrangements of old Christmas favorites is better than ever! Give her a try and purchase this album!"
A2Y1WSEDSXTYU6,B00EBJ65MS,5.0,"Mary J. Blige continues to redefine herself and her music with this new Christmas CD. She also continues to amaze and delight new audiences, of which I am one. This is no run-of-the mill Christmas album. While there are some chestnuts here, some of them are not roasting on an open fire. Ms. Blige takes some of them straight to your heart. She finds new ground to reel us back to the true meaning of Christmas, while taking us forward with passionate love. &#8220;Mary Did You Know&#8221; is an operatic gospel-inflected story sung with pure emotion. Her duet with Barbara Streisand, &#8220;When You Wish Upon a Star,&#8221; exhibits the beauty of childlike innocence and adapts it to the spirit of the season. Overall, this is an exceptional Christmas CD; very entertaining and appropriately heartfelt."
A3CW2WAF5OHL77,B00EBJ65MS,4.0,Mary has a voice like no other.  I have a number of her CD's.  This one was very good.  But I have heard even better sounds from Mary J. Blige
A160GNCP2T93DV,B00EBWHV4Q,4.0,"I'm a long time Live fan -- going all the way back to when Mental Jewelry broke onto MTV (I'm 44 now).  I've stuck with Ed and Live through their ups and downs, musically and band-wise.  Clearly most would agree that they peaked on Throwing Copper, with Secret Samadhi and Distance to Hear nice follow-ups even if they weren't stellar. From there we heard some fundamental changes in the music.  Ed seems to have taken his spirituality to front and center, which is OK, but the sonics started to suffer.  It was as if the music took a backseat to his more elemental and often times elementary lyrics.  He continues this trend with his solo efforts.  They are all easy listening and at times the old Live / Ed brilliance pokes through -- but just not often enough.  I still hold Ed and Live in very high regard and consider them to be one of the greats of all time (really!).  The Flood and The Mercy is a decent album, and true Live fans will find some songs to their liking, but I doubt that any of these tunes will find much airplay -- at least on this side of the pond.  I know that Live regrouped with a new lead singer, and from what I've heard they make some good music, but the lead singer just doesn't float my boat.  Anyway, I hope someday the boys can put their differences aside and stage a comeback with a new album that can take some cues from the sounds out of the past that catapulted them to the pinnacle of greatness in the music world.....Come on guys!!"
A3BESD9E51DR4L,B00EBWHV4Q,5.0,"This disc is filled with great songs, sounds and voice. Beautifully produced by Jamie Candiloro featuring stellar musicians. The Flood and The Mercy as the title suggests feels strong and powerful. A definite had to add it to my music collection. Buy this now!"
A25BJ6ZTGRNR3L,B00EC6VI3G,5.0,"I really enjoyed Soulfly's 2012 album, Enslaved; so I wasn't sure whether to be really excited or a little worried that Max and Co. had churned out another album so soon. I figured at least a hiatus or another Cavalera Conspiracy album would come first. But instead we had another round of Sepultura line-up reunion speculation. In any case, there are plenty of people who will jump to the comments section without even listening to Savages to dismiss whatever Max does due to some (ill-advised) Nu-Metal excursions he made over a decade ago. If this faux one-upsmanship makes you feel clever, then by all means. But for our purposes, let's try and look at Savages in its own context.As usual with Soulfly albums, Savages starts out with a nailbomb to the face (see what I did there?) on \"Bloodshed\". Direct, straight to the point, the song boasts some catchy guitar work and easy to remember, easy to follow lyrics. I mean, it'd be pretty hard to forget \"everywhere...is bloodshed!!!\" Speaking of Nailbomb, the throat-slitting thrash of \"Cannibal Holocaust\" is very reminiscent of Max's earlier work. I also love the riff that kicks in at the bridge around 2:30. I also find it kind of funny that a band from Brazil would write a song with a title from a movie about cannibals living in the Amazon. Well, at least it's good timing for Halloween.Some of the album's strongest moments come when Max lets his death metal side out more. This is what made songs like \"World Scum\" so awesome and the same approach works brilliantly on \"Fallen\". I really wish Max would do this more often, maybe even make an exclusively death metal album; I'd love to hear where he'd take it. With this in mind, \"Fallen\" is easily my favorite song on \"Savages\".On the strong side, there is the cover art...which gets your attention. To be fair, after awhile it's probably tough to come up with new ideas for Soulfly album covers. But still, I would think they could come up with something a little more interesting. Then there are the lyrics. While they are far from cringe-worthy, I'd say at least some of them are just generally \"shrug-worthy\". But simple as they may be, the lyrics gel nicely with the style itself, not to mention the album title.And yes, \"Ayatollah of Rock N' Rolla\" is a pretty silly title for a song, but any negative associated with this is instantly relieved by the presense of Clutch's Neil Fallon...and honestly, that dude can sing about whatever he likes and it'll be awesome. In general, the album's best moments are at the start with the first four songs, after which the album plateaus into familiar \"Soulfly territory\" (hah! I did it again).All things considered, this is a good and solid Soulfly album from start to finish, and it doesn't really need to be anything else.Favorite Songs: \"Bloodshed\", \"Cannibal Holocaust\", \"Fallen\", \"Ayatollah of Rock N' Rolla\""
A1BKKUWG3AJI8O,B00EC6VKCA,5.0,"\"Sister\" is a plunge into dark wonder and madness, beauty and grotesque, the human condition with the welcomed issue of a little bleeding stigmata.... Think: Bauhaus -meets Black Sabbath -meets Samhain's \"November Coming Fire\" -meets Sub Pop era Soundgarden -meets Slayer's \"Hell Awaits\" (my best shot at similes there). Pelle's vocals are quite gymnastic and passionately abrasive throughout, you can really hear him throwing his whole body into the performance. Plenty of catchy and interesting guitar riffs, some nasty lead flourishes pepper the songs to keep my \"metal\" taste in tune, while the drummer and bassist really churn through with a tasteful, groovy, & weighty drive. This album seems more broad-spaced and passionate than most any genre of metal, especially nowadays.One of the top albums of the year; Definitely a welcomed surprise to my ears, and hopefully to yours too..."
A2LTL305X8YRBY,B00EC6VKF2,5.0,"I can see where some could find this album to not be as good as their old material. This was my first Broken Hope CD, and it took a while for me to decide if I even wanted it as I had difficulty with certain aspects of the music, but overtime I started enjoying it. While the vocals may not be that great, unfortunately not much can be done about that. Original vocalist Joe Ptacek committed suicide, and there's not many capable of pulling off his low guttural vocal style. The music is as brutal as you'd expect even with the frontman that they do have. I'm sure that they have better albums, but give it a chance. Omen Of Disease is really something to add to your death metal collection, and the bonus DVD is good to view for the band's history."
AVERWO53G18P5,B00EC6VKF2,5.0,the new broken hope is killer don't listen to all these douche bags about the vocals they are very similar to joe ptacek the music has tons of grooves and blastbeats.definetly a great new album from these guys mandatory pick this cd up-great old school death metal
A4Z9NHOW5LT0M,B00EC6VMLE,5.0,"The interludes, the sound, the lyrics, Leonard's voice, they all were amazing.For such a large gap between this and their last album, this album was perfect.I was amazed to hear how incredible this album was as a whole, it is remarkable."
A2NP5H6JAU53B,B00EC6VXUE,4.0,"I enjoyed Vol.1 very much. This CD does not disappoint me , it has lived up to my expectation I really enjoy listening to it. Man Maxine voice has a unique sound to it."
ADN7ZJV6E5RSO,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,"I think the album is a great mix of old & new Fates Warning and I was really only a casual fan of the band in past years, always enjoying their music but not really owning much.  I think my thoughts changed when I heard the Arch/Matheos album in 2011, which was my album of the year.  Coupled with Ray Alder's work in Redemption (one of my favorite progressive metal bands), I really learned to appreciate his vocals much more.  One Thousand Fires really ignites the pilot light for me on this album and even with some smoother mellower moments in the middle of this album, this is a classic penned album.  Opening with 3 roaring songs, slowing up a bit including the beautiful 1:34 song Falling.  Lighthouse seems to have people split on it's effectiveness as a song but I happen to love the haunting melody in it.  Into the Black & Kneel & Obey then roll right in, 2 of my favorites on this album with some serious riffage & overall ripping work from Jim.  I dont have a lot more to add other than I don't usually hand out five star reviews, but this album does not really have any bad songs.  Very much looking towards the show in a couple weeks."
A11G9OKW1Y0ZUS,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,"Finally, this great band returns with an incredible disc. I really loved FWX, thought it was maybe their best work ever. This is a VERY strong release also, with the welcome return of Frank Aresti. New drummer Bobby Jarzombek fits like a glove, nailing the retired Mark Zonder's style while adding a heavier edge to the proceedings. Buy it!"
A3QSM8HQD9X2HP,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,I'm  huge fan of Fates Warning and they haven't lost a step. I'm going to see them in December in Atlanta and can't wait. As far as the album it's a lot better than Disconnected and FWX this is simply awesome complex metal at its best.
A18V2E6MMO8KLO,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,"Alder, Matheos, Vera and Aresti plus drummer Bobby Jarzombek = first original Fates Warning material in almost a decade. Not only are the original members (minus John Arch) reunited here, but Jarzombek has replaced Mark Zonder on the drums. And while Zonder had a style all to his own, the contributions of Jarzombek - who has played with the likes of Riot, Sebastian Bach and Halford - are significant. For point of reference, his performance is matched in intensity by the tracks he laid down for the Arch/Matheos release in 2011. Musically FW pretty much pick up right where they left off in 2004 with FWX, although these songs have a much heavier (more metal) and less atmospheric vibe. Ray Alder, who has fronted the band now since 1988's powerful No Exit, has spent the better part of the last decade as the lead singer for Redemption. It's fair to say those recordings and performances with Redemption have kept him at the top of his game - his voice doesn't like it has aged much since 1988! The lyrics are introspective as usual, yet always engaging. While not breaking any new ground here, these songs nicely encapsulate all of the elements from prior works that make the band great so this one sits nicely in their catalog between the heavier moments of the early material and the more modern leanings of the past few recordings, and then those angular grooves from the Perfect Symmetry era show up here as well to tie it all back up into one \"progressive\" knot. The bonus disc contains the extended versions of \"Firefly\" and \"Falling (Further),\" the latter really a much better tune than the album version, along with high quality live recordings of \"One\" and \"Life In Still Water\" from ProgPower 2009. It's great to have these pioneers of progressive metal once again recording and touring."
ANCNENCQQ5VU9,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,"I have just finished listening to this particular Fates Warning CD. It is very good and I have enjoyed it today. This particular Fates Warning CD is recorded well on both the studio songs as well as the live songs in this two CD set.  The packaging is good and the access to both of the CD's is easy. The price was a little steep for my liking however it is pretty close to the going rate asked for this CD  all around. I like Fates Warning a lot and in the past have had trouble listening to other FW titles because they were  recorded badly.Not this one though, it is done right and the music has some weak moments in them but overall you will enjoy this and I recommend it to all who like Fates Warning are just want to try something new."
AUHZ4NEDBKM1X,B00EC6W0AG,5.0,Fates is back and right away you can tell Aresti is there as well. The dual guitar work on this CD is incredible. Great musicianship throughout the entire album. Fates Warning remains relevant in the prog metal world.
A17IO5JJ54G9DU,B00EC6W28Q,5.0,"Joe Nichols is a throwback (in the best sense of the term).Great album.  This is a real, genuine, bona fide country album, plain & simple.  If you like old school sounding country music, give this album a listen!"
A2FWZ58M6IQMD7,B00EC6W28Q,5.0,"Joe Nichols is one of the most underrated country singers out there today. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone with a better, more pure voice than Joe. He uses no studio magic, no auto-tune, no synthesizers - just him and the music. He consistently has put out superb albums, and this one is no exception.This is a tale of two albums. There are 16 songs on here, which is twice what his last offering produced. The front half of the disc is geared more towards the pop country crowd. The second half are more traditional country songs, like most of Joe's previous albums. And both halves are superb!Let me break it down:1) Yeah - 5/5; a fun, lighthearted, catchy country tune about getting a girl. I'm pretty sure this is going to be his next single.2) Hard to be Cool - 4/5; another fun, poppy, lighthearted song about being with a hot woman. Catchy, but not as memorable as some of the others.3) Y'ant to - 4/5; fun, upbeat, catchy song about asking a woman to join him for some fun after meeting her in a bar4) Hee Haw - 5/5; Joe's voice sounds amazing on this song. It's amazing how low his baritone can go. Super fun, catchy, upbeat song.5) Just Let Me Fall in Love with You - 5/5; slower, sweet song about falling in love (obviously)6) Baby You're in Love with Me - 3.5/5; very poppy, mid-tempo song. Gets a little repetitive - not one of my favorites.7) Better than Beautiful - 5/5; one of the best tracks on the album! Slow, very sweet song you'd imagine singing to a woman. Joe's voice sounds fantastic.8) Gotta Love it - 4/5; mid tempo, poppy, upbeat song about how happy someone is now that he's in love. Catchy and fun. Not a fan of the horns in the background.9) Sunny and 75 - 4.5/5; his first hit single off this album. Poppy, catchy, and upbeat.10) Love Has a Way - 5/5; one of my favorite songs on the album. Mid tempo ballad that is very catchy and sweet, and really highlights Joe's voice. Great steel guitar on this one.11) Smile on Mine - 4/5; catchy, upbeat country song with great slide guitar12) Open up a Can - 4.5/5; typical fun, tongue-in-cheek, double entendre Joe Nichols song (ala Tequila Makes her Clothes Fall off). About a guy that hates his boss - funny!13) Billy Graham's Bible - 5/5; one of the best songs on the album. Very country, slower song that really exemplifies why Joe should be a superstar. Unbelievably good.14) Old School Country Song - 5/5; mid tempo, very country song. Very much like a traditional George Strait song. Excellent steel guitar on this one.15) Footlights - 5/5; BEST song on the album. Old Merle Haggard song with Joe's spin on it. Very country, slower, AMAZING.16) Crickets - 5/5; great way to end the album. Country, catchy, mid tempo song that is very sweet. Great steel guitar.Overall, I was initially turned off to the front half of the disc, as I don't like pop country. But Joe's version of pop country is far more country than anyone else produces these days. The front half really grew on me, and now I listen to the entire disc start to finish without skipping a single song.It's almost impossible to produce an album with 16 great songs, but Joe has done it. He has never sounded better than on this record, and it exemplifies why he deserves to be a superstar. Here's to hoping he gets the airplay he deserves!"
AJCLUHSI9EE3F,B00EC6W2ZY,5.0,the first 5 songs are new in 2013! they sound really good! the rest of the album is taken out of the vaults from 1972 and also sounds good! If you are an old Black Oak fan like I am you will love this! Jim Dandy and the band still have it! A+
A286EDV953ZZJT,B00EC6W2ZY,5.0,"BOA are my favorite band of all-time and this is definitely a welcome addition to their catalogue!  Like most of their fans, their early 70's heyday is my favorite era of the band and that's represented here in a big way.  Previously unreleased studio cuts and alternate versions from recording sessions with the late, great Tom Dowd make up the bulk of this release.  The five new songs are good, too, but you'll buy this for the previously unreleased cuts recorded with Dowd.Fans will also love the packaging with tons of rare photos.Am ecstatic to think that there might be more in the vault where this came from AND we want the boys to put out MORE NEW MUSIC!  It's been more than a dozen years since their last studio release (The Wild Bunch) and, for guys who used to crank out two LPs a year, we know they've got to be able to write more than 5 new songs in that period of time."
A1KYHC3ZXAJICU,B00ECK21WO,5.0,"First things first, the box set is wonderful! However, if you've bought releases from the King Crimson Collector's Club and paid for downloads from the band's site over the years, there isn't too much you don't already have here. If you haven't then your in for a real treat. The large chunk of the USA and Canada tour is here running from the end of April to July 1974. This is the last tour that the band would do until the next reformation in the early 1980's. The box also includes Red and USA albums in their new 2013 mixes. They're also included in high resolution in various mixes along with a few other shows on the dvd and blu rays. There's also the nice bells and whistles with booklets and such. Yep, it's a bit of money but it's well worth the purchase if you can afford it. Mine actually cost a bit more as I bought it from Burning Shed but it came with a t shirt."
A1K9IW99EFBZ52,B00ECK21WO,5.0,"...seriously, the Fripp / Wetton / Bruford edition of K.C. was a power trio, and &#34;Red&#34; was a prog metal album. Grand Funk had a certain level of intensity with its populist &#34;heartland rock,&#34; and King Crimson...this version of the band...was beyond intense. If you've read any of the &#34;Fripp Diaries&#34; from various box sets and archive releases, you know that onstage there was a constant struggle to be &#34;King of the Hill&#34;...amp knobs constantly turned up and up and up to make sure one could be heard over the din of his mates. This was a tough, dangerous band, one that could go from a whisper and a scream in a heartbeat. One reviewer famously wrote that of the Fripp / Wetton / Bruford band that &#34;While Yes prefers to marvel at the world, King Crimson grabs it by the ****s.&#34; So true.Enough introductory conversation...DO you want this box set, and if you DO, why? Just as Dead Heads voraciously collect every Grateful Dead note they can get their hands on, every performance on this massive box set has its own form of nuance. It's not for the casual fan...neither was the 4-CD &#34;Great Deceiver,&#34; duplicated in this set (for the most part). What you get is some of the smartest, tightest, toughest improv imaginable. As a fan of the band...ESPECIALLY this edition...I wanted it, and when I heard it, I was not disappointed.Every once in a while you have to treat yourself. This is one of those times."
AJ820RCQQWD9N,B00ECL7ZCY,4.0,"A nice poppy, pleasant disc. A bit too &#34;dance music&#34; in places for me, but even those songs are hook-laden. Favorite songs for me were &#34;The Wire&#34;, &#34;Falling&#34;, and &#34;Don't Save Me&#34;..."
A3V4CL53QT9X7N,B00ECL7ZCY,4.0,"It's hard to believe that it was 43 years ago this December that Fanny released their debut album. Long considered the premiere all-female band, everyone from The Runaways to the GoGo's and the Bangles to L7 and The Donnas have persued their crowns as the Queens of Rock & Roll. However, to date, no one has come close to dethroning them and winning that prize.Flash forward to 2013. The hype over the Haim sisters ~ Este, Danielle and Alana ~ has been intense. Now, with their major label release DAYS ARE GONE, we all get to see if the goods match the gossip.I, for one, almost never buy an album sight unseen. In the old days (read: when vinyl was still king!), I had a hard and fast rule of hearing at least four cuts before any purchase was made. I've since loosened up...now it's just one or two. That said, there was something about HAIM that just seemed...cool. And in one of the weakest years for new music in recent memory, taking a chance on something new seemed like a no-brainer.Gotta say....I'm glad I did! DAYS ARE GONE is one of the strongest, most enjoyable, debuts in recent memory. Full of flavors and vibes that bring to mind everyone from Kate Bush, Sarah McLachlan and Teena Marie to Peter Gabriel, Roxy Music, Prince and mid-to-late 80's Stevie Nicks, the band still remains absolutely themselves. This is, indeed, a group to keep an eye on!Things start out strong with the atmospheric \"Falling.\" The lovely harmonies wash over an ecconomical arrangement that ebbs and flows, drawing the listener in deeper and deeper. Toss in introspective lyrics (\"I hear the voices and they're calling/For me now (I know)/That nothing's gonna wake me now/'Cause I'm a slave to the sound\") and you have a real winner. Nice way to kick things off!Equally as strong is \"Forever.\" With it's 80's dance groove and sultry lead vocal, Teena Marie's innate ability to meld pop, rock and R&B; together comes to mind. The cut is insanely catchy, but there's also a real depth to it as well. And I love the \"Edge of Seventeen\" guitars! Another real gem.Even with it's Eagles-esque opening guitar riff, it's another 70's super-group that \"The Wire\" brings to mind. With it's punchy rock arrangement and shared lead vocals, the Los Angeles Times was right on the money when they compared the song to classic Fleetwood Mac. DAYS ARE GONE's most straight on rock track, this is a sound HAIM would be wise to persue on future releases.\"If I Could Change Your Mind\" has a similar arrangement to both \"Falling\" and \"Forever\", albeit with a slightly more percussive edge. A strong lead vocal (that brings to mind a more rocking Sarah McLachlan) is the cut's main focal point, but until each of the ladies' take on lead vocals becomes more clear, it might be wise to note who's handling the actual lead on any given track. Still, very cool.There's a gauzy groove-meets-surf vibe on \"Honey And I\" that's totally hypnotic. The instrumentation bops along, while the lead and harmony vocals brilliantly play tag with each other. Thoughtful lyrics (\"This song can't be played alone/It was made to be played with my/Honey and I\") cap things off. Building up steam (and intensity) by song's end, it's clear this is another winner!\"Don't Save Me\" is sort of \"Kate Bush-meets-Heart, by way of Cyndi Lauper\", but done in an equally organic HAIM vibe. One of the great things about HAIM is the fact that their sterling vocals are always up front and center, aided and abetted by the instrumentation, but never overpowered or, even worse, buried by it (A frequent problem in much of today's current brand of pop music). \"Don't Save Me\" is a pitch-perfect example of this important (but all-too-often overlooked) quality.Another favorite is the Tom Tom Club-flavored title track. There's something almost cinematic about \"Days Are Gone\", in both a cartoon and art house way....I LOVE this song! There's not a whole lot to the arrangement, but that's O.K. ~ the minimal instrumentation just allows the vocals, all layered and quirky, to shine even more! An absolutely stunning cut.In less talented hands, the dissonant \"My Song 5\" might come across as strident and artsy for art's sake, but that's not the case here. With it's odd vaudeville-meets-early-horror movie groove, this cut fits right into the overall vibe, adding yet another color to HAIM's pallet. In fact, it provides the perfect balancing act to a lot of the other songs found on D.A.G. So far out it's in, this one's a keeper!Things take another nice turn on \"Go Slow.\" A gorgeous ballad that dances along, I SO could have seen Kate Bush singing this twenty years ago! Killer lyrics (\"'Cause you took away all my young life/And I hate who I've become/From your heat now\") and mesmerizing instrumentation coalesce into a sound and style that is both dazzling and dynamic. Wow! That's all I can say....just....WOW!There's an intensity to \"Let Me Go\" that pounds away at the listener's senses, until the almost-hypnotic tribal beats and surf guitar riffs suck you down into a whirlpool of tunefulness. I swear, a big part of HAIM's charm is that a lot of their stuff shouldn't work...and yet it does! Another strong cut.The disc wraps up with another favorite, the spirited \"Running If You Call My Name.\" A shimmering arrangement perfectly cushions the buoyant vocals, lovingly layered one over the other. As with \"Go Slow\", there's a push-and-pull vibe going on here, one that lulls you, but never, ever bores you. One of my favorites cuts, not only off of DAYS ARE GONE, but of 2013, period!So where do the sisters Haim go from here? Well, they certainly need to find a way to more strongly differentiate their three individual voices. And I would love to see more straight ahead rock, ala \"The Wire.\" But for the most part, I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that the world is HAIM's oyster. One thing for sure....somewhere, June & Jean Millington, Alice de Buhr and Nickey Barclay are smiling, knowing it was all worth it! (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics)."
A5LYCROZZUJNC,B00ECL7ZCY,2.0,"Prompted by Grantland's review (or sycophantic praise?) of this ostensibly \"Indie\" act, I thought I'd give it a spin.  Grantland is normally a trusted source and will forever be dear to me for publishing David Foster Wallace's (R.I.P.) brilliantly insightful (and obsessively footnoted, as was DFW's m-o) profile of Roger Federer.  But on this particular pitch from Grantland, all I can say is...WHIFF.  Seriously.Seriously? [giving it one more try]Seriously.  These tunes are light and boppy, sugar- (or saccharine)-coated boogie or even doo-wop -- a fusion of Wilson Phillips and the Bee Gees -- and could never be construed as \"Indie\" by any metric I've ever encountered.  A few tunes might even be mistaken for '70s-era Michael Jackson by the lesser-trained ear.  I suppose Haim could be a fun listen for those seeking a sound less than substantial, but I can't see this act having much staying power.  If anyone listens to Haim at all two or five years from now, it'll be while reclining in a dentist's chair with the local \"LUV\" or \"LITE\" hits station murmuring on a background Bose.  Then again, I thought the same thing about that other non-Indie \"Indie\" act Maroon 5, and people are still buying their \"music\" (if you could call it that).  I'd be surprised, though, if Haim garnered that much of a following."
AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,B00ECL7ZCY,4.0,"After first seeing Haim's single Don't Save Me on Epic Videos on the Palladia channel, I thought I'd buy the album.  Their sound is simple yet fun.  The vocals and electric beats sound 80s and their guitar riffs are basic yet reminiscent of 70s rock.  Their sound is not complex and does lack depth, but I still found it enjoyable.  The Wire and Forever are catchy singles and I find myself singing it over and over again.  These sisters definitely rock and are worth a try."
AQV142R2H69QK,B00ECL7ZPG,4.0,"This sophomore album from \"The Head and the Heart\" is very welcome. Whilst a band from Seattle and signed to Sub Pop Records their music is much more folk rock orientated without a hint of the grunge in which that label once specialised. Their self titled debut sold a respectable 300,000 across the US and they have toured incessantly over the past two years supporting bigger acts like Mike Morning Jacket and Death Cab for Cutie. The big time may therefore be around the corner and they sit on the cusp of much wider recognition. \"Let's be still\" is a slightly nosier beast than their debut and more consistent. It shows growing confidence and songs like \"Homecoming Heroes\" and \"Summertime\" have a spring in there step. Yet there are far from the most impressive on this set. It is songs like \"Another Story\" where the bands true qualities shine not least the superb harmonies which underpin the songs. It is a standout track albeit telling the heartbreaking story of the Newtown tragedy at the Sandy Hook School as viewed through the eyes of band member, Josiah Johnson. The gentle acoustics of \"10,000 Weight in Gold\" is probably nearer to the vibe of their debut and is a lovely ballad, whilst the pounding \"Shake\" shows that when the band plug in the electric guitars they can make a glorious noise.There are a few issues as on the first listens the title track is bit ponderous and the 54 second long \"Springtime\" is nice enough but essentially the slow opening for Summertime mentioned above, begging the question why it isn't one song? These faults are however rectified in the shape of songs like the excellent \"Josh McBride\" a wintery lament that will soundtrack late evenings; similarly \"These days are numbered\" actually sounds like a song from those gifted Swedish sisters who make up \"First Aid Kit\". The best is saved for last with the excellent six minute plus closer \"Gone\" where the band build to a huge crescendo in a pounding piano ballad. Overall therefore \"Let's be still\" is worthy of deeper investigation and hopefully the bands charms will soon be recognised by music connoisseurs across the globe."
A3V3TLLLBFYE12,B00ECL7ZPG,5.0,"The new record from The Head and The Heart is, indeed, a departure from their self-titled debut. For those fans expecting that same sound, it's there, but as accents to a more firm, exploratory tone.All that said, this record is full of highlights and is making me wish I brought earbuds to work. From 'Homecoming Heroes' to 'Summertime', there's plenty of head bopping, foot tapping rhythms to go around. Add in Josiah showing his full range and Charity providing her unique voice, and THATH has a second fantastic record.Some listeners will expect them to stay with the sound that they nailed in their debut. Bands like this need to stretch and tap into different avenues to stay fresh and challenge themselves. Buy this record!"
A3QMUKHMLP9X3Y,B00ECTZJK6,4.0,Can Korn actually be getting more mellow with age.It sure seems like it.This album to awhile to grow on me.It is not as heavy as their other stuff yet still very good.Not what you would expect from them but Korn never really has fit the same mold twice.That is what makes them great.Nobody does it like Korn.Still it is actually a refreshing change from their last couple of records.Just don't expect to crank every song.
A6J7UPYUI96XO,B00ECTZJK6,5.0,"Simply put, \"The Paradigm Shift\" is a modern rock masterpiece. It's Korn's hardest album in years, but it also manages to be more melodic and diverse than previous efforts, meaning that the album will please not only the die hard fans of Korn's early work, but any fan of modern rock.\"Prey for Me\" is a crushing intro, an absolutely brutal tune with a catchy chorus. \"Love and Meth\" is an intense and emotional second track, one of the best on the album. \"Spike in my Veins\" is one of Korn's hardest tracks ever, and still catchy. It's impossible to sit still while listening to these songs!!\"Never Never\" is the album's first single, and it's the only track reminiscent of the previous effort, \"The Path of Totality.\" It's a great track regardless. \"Punishment Time\" is more of a slow burn, but it hits heavy too at times, and the band's vocals and harmonies are right on. The deluxe edition has two additional tracks, \"I Wish I wasn't Born Today\" which is okay, and \"Tell Me What You Want\" which is outstanding.All in all, Korn returns with not only a solid effort to please their fans, but an overall great rock album by any standard. For the first time, the band shows the promise to not only grow older gracefully, but the ability to reinvent themselves by doing what they do best, which is make music on their own terms. So rarely does a band make an album this great so far along into their careers."
A1KQINHNB70X53,B00ECTZJK6,5.0,"This is the korn i missed. I enjoyed the past 4 albums without head, but he was the missing ingredient and now i can tell more than ever. This to me is the best record since untouchables. This is an album that must be listened to from beginning to end. The more i hear it the more i love it! Best rock record of 2013. Love all tracks, my favorite song at the moment is ''pray for me''."
A2M7F9WN6BNG4Y,B00ECTZJK6,5.0,"I loove this album. I am trying not to listen to it to death but good albums have that effect!It sounds like Follow the Leader mixed with Issues...and some elements of Untouchables and even has sounds/singing remenecant of The first debut album..I really love this album and lulluby for a Sadist is my fav and Prey for me and... God They're all good lol...but have to say, my least favorite is Tell me What you Want  ...just not really my style but the ending soubds like black metal or something from slipknot lol (people gonna love that )..overall,  I knew this album was going to deliver...And it did.  This Ladies and Gentleman just might be Korn's best album yet.. and I won't even argue with that. ..especially considering it was an emotional reunion with Head and all. GOD bless korn. They will always be the best Rock/Metal band that ever existed in my opinion.. Im ready for the 13th album already lol"
A13N40YR6UZFRW,B00ECTZJK6,5.0,"Their back! Minus the drummer..... That being said, this album rocks! I didn't buy Korns last two albums for obvious reasons, but this album has that signature guitar sound. What a treat to have Head back!"
A23FBFFTE7S822,B00ECV85K0,1.0,"I'm a big Shatner fan.  I've bought his music, movies, and even paid to meet the man himself, but this album has to be one of the worst that I've ever had the misfortune to sit through.  The lyrics are infantile and silly, the music reminds me of a combo between, Kenny G, muzak (elevator music), and ELO.  I barely got through it.  I agree with a previous reviewer that Has Been was a wonderful album, this just feels like a vanity project/cash machine."
A3SAJFC65EGFZJ,B00ECV85K0,4.0,"Although I enjoyed watching the Stark Trek TV shows I never thought I would have any William Shatner album. What got me to buy this was the fact that I had bought the previous two releases of Billy Sherwood, which are the Prog Collective albums, and I am a Yes fan.  This is much like the Prog Collective work, but it's more fun to listen to. Shatner's spoken words add another dimension to the music. Perhaps it's like the Moody Blues and Mike Pinder reciting poems on Days of Future Passed. It's just more relaxing, playful, yet serious at times. It's like a breath of fresh air. The tracks are fresh sounding. It has most of what I'm looking for in progressive rock. Actually some of the things I didn't like about Prog Collective/Sherwood albums are not a problem with this. The spoken word makes you think, and it's kind of funny, but serious at the same time. This would be great to listen to when looking at the stars, or going on a trip in the wilderness. I think part of the reason I'm enjoying this, is because I've developed more of a taste for Sherwood's stuff and maybe he's getting better. When Sherwood was in Yes, it wasn't the best stuff, but vocally and lyrically it was good."
A2RTF3TIS3DMZ8,B00ED1QYNY,5.0,Beautifully packaged collection for the equally beautiful Patti Page. A great collection of her often overlooked Columbia singles. Do yourself a favor and pick up this wonderful collection today.
AA762OWLWCPQ2,B00ED76SCA,5.0,"This album is not a rock album...yet it's not a acoustic album completely either. It has the best elements of what has catapulted SCC to the top of Christian music. Overall though the album doesn't really deviate too much from past records in sound. To me that's fine. Songs like 'Love Take Me Over', 'Take another Step', Michael and Maria, and of course the title track Glorious Unfolding and make something beautiful are after one listen my favorites, although pretty much all could be lol. I have followed this artist through his darkest of times after the loss of his daughter Maria and I can say, He still has such strong faith in the Lord and this album proclaims that well. The strings and light guitar work on the closing track 'Feet of Jesus' is really good. Music like this just reminds us as believers of that glorious day we will see Him face to face and how Jesus is completing his story in and through us right now in the day to day life we call here and now. If you want music that just merely makes you feel good and rock out, you may want to go elsewhere. But, if you love introspective and reflective music that brings you to God and reminds you of who He is....this is a jewel not worth passing up."
A1G34PPPERZT2X,B00EDJVLUW,4.0,good cd
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00EDPFGMU,5.0,"Discussing hip-hop albums is very difficult for me as my conception of it is extremely sketchy. I'm admittedly disconnected from the music,it's culture and what does come my way from it is probably mistranslated due that same strong distance from the source. When Drake first came to my attention via mainly an CD cover and one television performance involving his previous albumTake Care,it was apparent this was no shallow visual enticement. Reviewing that album bought out some unusual thoughts from me as,truth be told,it was entirely different musically and thematically than what little hip-hop I'd heard. There was a stubbornness about it,yet a clarity as well Somehow I was very much looking forward to this release which,again features extremely artful and even optimistic cover art. In the last couple of years Drake's success level has exploded. It would've been so easy for him to portray himself only in the shallowest possible terms. Instead he actually picks up where the previous album left off.Musically realized by a number of multi-instrumentalists-one on each track this album starts out with a quintet of songs ranging from \"Tuscan Leather\",\"Furthest Thing\",\"Started From The Bottom\",\"Wu-Tang Forever\" and \"Own It\". These are instrumentally psychedelic Chill grooves-stripped down in fine hip-hop style with some wonderfully chorded and moody live piano and sped up backwards tape loops. As an MC Drake sets the stage exploring the possibilities of being a shallow rap superstar stereotype-defaming women carelessly until he realizes he is hurting the one he really loves. On \"Worst Behavior\",almost needless to say,this need to embrace hedonism comes to a head lyrically over a rather Egyptian/Arab style rhythm and vocal chant. On \"From Time\",a strong jazzy soul tone comes in with female vocalist Jhene Aiko arrives with her perspective as Drake himself reflects on the awkward elements of his family and upbringing. Featuring Majid Jordan \"Hold On,We're Going Home\" is a strong,more personally assured boogie funk-type number with a definite early 80's flavor and my personal favorite number on this album.\"Connect\",\"The Language\" and \"305 To My City\" have a rather darker tone as Drake's perceived world of sex and fame begins to unravel fast. \"Too Much\" reaches a lyrical catharsis of it all with the weary vocals of instrumentalist Sampha expressing the title's point of view. \"Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2\" brings in Jay Z for what seems to be a reflection on Drake's detractors (or haters I suppose you'd call them) and for the bonus songs \"Come Thru\",with its grooving sensibility urges both parties in the relationship to be honest with themselves. Of course the closing number \"All Me\" with 2 Chains and Big Sean brings me to how I see Drake on this album. That inner struggle heard across his previous album is growing in complexity. Its a more modern day variation of the age old conflict of the classic soul/funk icon,that of the carnal and the sacred. We're in a time when hip-hop has started to take a long look at it's extreme and sometimes cliched outlook on masculinity. While Drake's story telling continues to grow even more insightful and perceptive,he seems desperate to make excessive use of stereotypical hip-hop language. Prime example is his extreme overuse of the self-pejorative \"n*gga\",which I don't feel belongs on this album personally-and certainly not the excesses with which its used. Aside from that (subjective) lyrical misstep,this album finds Drake continuing to establish is self questioning persona. Which I hope will serve to take the rest of hip-hop on a similar journey as he goes."
A1YHRKWG8FT1HI,B00EDPFGMU,5.0,this cd was great. all of the songs were calm and different. i liked his lyrics and the different sounds
A3AYI5QDZUUBTN,B00EDPFGMU,5.0,This is my favorite Drake CD! This is a masterpiece to be cherished for years to come! Drake is very transparent with his flow! I must say I love it from start to finish!
A2R9HPVHD9L1C5,B00EDPFGMU,5.0,Didnt really appreciate this album until going to his concert but listening to it again I would give it a 5/5. Wish his version of &#34;Too Much&#34; from Jimmy Falon was on here...so much more passion
A3HNPEFZFFLUHY,B00EDPFGMU,5.0,It is a really great album. i love all of it. i can listen to it all the way through. this is really good work from drake and i can't wait to hear more. worth the money
A2TVKL0ZE90C1J,B00EDPFGMU,4.0,"I'm not a die-hard Drake fan but I must admit that I am really digging this album. The music is eclectic,  soulful, and mellow for the most part. While I am prone to say, \"I don't get it\", when it comes to allot of hip-hop artists, I find that Drake is actually quite easy to understand and even relate to."
A3B9L99R4T7XY7,B00EDX5QMM,2.0,"there is plenty of style and atmosphere but not a lot of substance on this album. it feels like musical smoke and mirrors, the wizard of oz, with little rhythmic invention or composition. electronic music doesn't need to be rigorous, it can be loose and free-form. however jaar just doesn't give you much to grab onto. his affected vocals, which are baritone and quavering like someone impersonating a ghost, do little for me. the lyrics are abstract to the point of sounding amateur and unfocused. there could have been considerably more guitar work as well, and the one really memorable riff, on the track &#34;paper trails&#34; is poorly played.the one exception to an otherwise forgetful album is&#34;freak go home&#34; - very cool track with a slinky rhythm and undulating intensity that keeps you gripped."
A1FUJZKVLTKIUT,B00EDY5KTA,5.0,"My family and I love this music! Every time I hear &#34;Let it Go&#34; , I want to fling my arms out and sing! The music is wonderful, entertaining  (&#34;In Summer&#34;) sad, (&#34;Conceal, don't Feel&#34;) and downright cute (&#34;Love is an Open Door&#34;). If you want to dance as you dust, this is the music for it!"
AEG2PL4SF2IY0,B00EDY5KTA,5.0,Catchy tune. Can feel the sadness between the sisters without even watching the film. Follows the movie. Great sing along in the car. The kids aren't interested in the instrumental & I myself haven't listened to it fully to comment. If it is like the rest of the CD. I'm sure it is enjoyable.
A7SK91SE8UZE6,B00EDY5KTA,5.0,Happen to see this movie several times with different people and just love the music. I've listened to this so many times. Plus I loved the bonus material and hearing some of the songs that didn't make it and their creative process. It was really unique and enjoyable to experience the journey with them. Highly recommend for your soundtrack collection :)
A2SX0AP507CQ1Z,B00EDY5KTA,5.0,"If you or your kids like the film this is an easy buy. The songs are catchy and clever. Some are humorous, possibly hilarious. My daughter loves the songs and sings them while listening on her kindle."
A24WAWK31L5M2W,B00EDY5KTA,4.0,"The songs in this soundtrack is above good, it puts you into a good mod while everyone else is in a bad one."
AAUQDL5ZNN040,B00EDY5KTA,5.0,"After seeing the movie, I just loved all the songs and knew that I had to get the soundtrack when it came out. Very enjoyable!"
A1OM59JGVNY2JQ,B00EE6IDIC,5.0,This CD I will listen to all year.  Such great music and has some pipes in it.  It is Irish music and the songs in Traces great deep voice are fantastic.  So glad I chose it.  I help all the stars that help our military and Trace works to help Wounded Warrior Project.  Got blessed me for the choice..... his CD so good. Elaine in TEXAS!
A1NXNQA4K6226H,B00EE6IDIC,5.0,"I bought this CD simply because I am a Trace Adkins fan and also like Christmas music.  I was blown away by how amazing this whole album is.  I have listened to this Christmas CD more than any other one in my collection.  Trace's deep voice is a complete hit with the celtic music.  If you're looking for some new Christmas music or are a fan of Trace's, buy this album you will LOVE it!"
A1DI2M1WMWRXRB,B00EE6IDIC,3.0,"This is a good Christmas CD and all Trace Adkins' fans will enjoy it.  The songs and the musical accompaniment are very good, but the songs lack the power and emotion that I have  come to expect from him."
A21LTLPIXMD6PP,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the top 10 releases of ALL time.  I 've never been more hypnotized by any release from any band more than I am with this release.  I am stunned by the quality of this music; I can't stop listening.  How can you choose a favorite, when, if not EVERY song, at least HALF the CD is in the running for the BEST song STRYPER has ever produced?  And they have produced an extensive line of hits that have standing power, not to mention many of them have recently been redone so you have TWO different INCREDIBLE versions to choose from.Here is something you may not know, unless you are a hardcore STRYPER fan:  They are currently offering a limited edition t-shirt that will turn heads.  AND:  A double LP, forged in yellow, with all the guys' signatures on the cover.  It's pricey but, these guys are worth it.  And not only that, it's a great investment!  STYPER WILL ALWAYS HAVE FANS!!!!  Top This!Update 8Nov2013As mentioned above, as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the top ten albums of ALL Time.  What the other nine are I don't know but it doesn't matter, they don't compare to this:  This may very well be the number one album of all time, for all I know.It is the single most powerful, uplifting sound I have ever experienced.  You don't listen to this release from Stryper, you absorb it.  It becomes part of you; it dissolves into your bloodstream and flows into your future; it shows you the way.  Listening to this CD will change your life.  I know it has mine, listening to only 4 tracks over the past month I have been incredibly energized; it will empower you as it has me, you will be amazed.  When I heard the rest, I was devastated; they not only knocked the ball out of the park, they knocked the park off the ball-field and relocated it in Heaven.  Simply Incredible.  Ingenius.This is better than AC-DC's Back In Black, or Highway to Hell; Ozzy Osbourne never put out an album this good.  Even Ted Nugent and ZZTop have been topped.  Scorpions?  Van Halen?  Sorry, in the dust.  Nickelback?  Disturbed?  Awesome but keep trying.  Metallica?  Megadeth?  Even Jimmy, J.P., Tesla, Leppard, Zep?  I love all these bands and have for years, but this is better, hands down, bar none.  Only Ronnie James Dio has ever come close, with Holy Diver, but even so, there is no doubt, a new metal king has arrived in town and this king will be here for some time to come.  Stryper has set the new standard for METAL EXCELLENCE and that standard is exceptional vocals of deeply inspiring lyrics, high speed dueling guitars and rhythmic bass delivered with a pounding drum beat that will absolutely CRUSH YOU and make you beg and pray to be crushed again and again.  It's a once in a lifetime sound that will destroy any resistance or competition to it.  There is not an album out there that can touch this, none are equal, none are better and it will be some time before any band that tries to top it will be able to deliver; it is quite possible that none may ever achieve it, save one, Stryper.Buy the CD, buy more than one.  When it shows up get some Snickers, get comfortable and put it on Repeat Play All, because you won't be going anywhere for a while once you begin listening to it.  Keep the volume control handy because you'll be using it a lot!  And you'll be right where you want to be, musically sedated and humbled.  Yes, you will be humbled, you may even tear up:  It is magical.  Do yourself a favor and be a part of it, and let it be a part of you.  Rise to new heights with the greatest sound experience on the planet, you deserve it.  God's own hand MUST be at work here, so share it.  Share it, share it, share it.The band, Michael especially, hyped this release up tremendously ahead of time, setting up extremely high expectations for their fan base:  I've been with them steadily since To Hell With The Devil and I know personally it has far exceeded my wildest expectations, it's brilliance continues to unfold exponentially and is still growing with no end in sight, only the sky, only the edges of the visible universe.  Hallelujah guys, way to go!  I will likely go deaf before I tire of listening to this, or even comprehend it all.  Instantly Legendary:  It will RULE for decades and be whispered everywhere, in awe.  Raw, hard, heavy metal perfection, juiced up and absolutely chock full of meaning.  It is a wall of musical intensity like nothing on Earth; you don't hit it, IT HITS YOU.  Sounds like ear candy to me, give me more, I am sooo hungry, I could eat for eternity on a feast this tasty.  This is soul food at its finest and it's the best there's ever been.  Take a bite, you'll be hooked, you'll be addicted, you will be:  Stryper4Ever, as am I.Sorry, gotta go now, the next song is starting, until next time......."
AU2OVQ9M78B52,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,AWESOME!!! This is one of if not the best &#34;Stryper&#34; releases to date. My prayers have been answered. We have the real Heavy Metal of &#34;Stryper&#34; back! This is I believe equal to or more so the heaviest head bangin' Heavy Metal they have done and would have been in perfect order after &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34;. Great harmonies on guitars and vocals like we used to know so well and for those who thought Michael could not hit highs he will silence any non believers in that department multiple times over. The classic grinding guitars and pounding drums are back and Timothy is heard clearly on the bass. Great all around package. Really like the picture of them in the newer version &#34;To Hell With The Devil&#34; era clothing. I have followed this band since their first EP &#34;The Yellow And Black Attack&#34; and have seen them gradually come back to the greatness they once were and they I can assure you have accomplished that and more. Do not miss out on this one.
A325K75JJOGDYZ,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"Who was going to tell me that after thirty years full of classics,Stryper would do his best album and honestly is what I think. I will not make a review song to song, just say that this cd is awesome. Mixing hard rock and classic melodic heavy metal . The years do not affect this band (have done a deal with the devil???). God bless this band."
API8LHQI6HWKX,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"I haven't listened to Stryper in years. However their latest release is going to be playing for quite a while. Im loving the fact that in our music today metal has lost its way, its become dark, ugly, with no talent to showcase unless you just want to show how fast you can drum and run your fingers up and down the frets. And as far as good vocals go , forget it everyone wants to yell and scream and sing like their choking to death. It has been the older bands that continue to make a comeback and show how its suppose to be done. 80's style.Stryper has done this with No More Hell To Pay....this is a great album and exemplifies what a good metal album should sound like today. Even if your not Christian , youll get a nod for buying this baby cause its got all the goods!"
ASVMMPVJNYCME,B00EEPFLHE,4.0,This is their best since to hell with the Devil. Every song is great except Jesus is just alright I couldn't stand the original version.  Great solos great drums and the vocal sounds as good as it did in the 1980's.
A3BVGB5ZJKPFS2,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"After two other releases (The Covering and The Second Coming--all the hits REDONE) and a DVD of a show in Jakarta Indonesia, finally we are given another release!! It's absolutely outstanding..."
A16BBY26HH1ZKO,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"Stryper has been one of my favorite gospel rock bands for a long time. For awhile I thought that they gave up on the gospel rock scene. But they arrived back on the scene just in time for me to realize how much I missed hearing gospel rock music. I love their signature color gold and black, cool colors. They also did a fine recording job on the album. Stryper still rocks."
A3FWGY4A33WKFM,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"I have always appreciated Stryper's efforts at injecting Christianity into metal music. During the '80s, they had their moments. However, I always struggled with the music overall. I would like one song and could not stand the next. Well, as they say, \"That was then, this is now...\"As with Murder by Pride, this band has grown and matured musically. The lyrics have never really been an issue for me. However, transitions and creativeness, musically, are what used to halt my interest. Those issues are gone! This is a band that is not only strong spiritually, but have become a strong musical group as well. This is '80s metal at its musical best with 21st century production. Not a bad song on here. Even the ballad, The One, is not overly sappy (a complaint from their 80s output) and, frankly, is even difficult to recognize as a ballad. They even take a another stab at a cover song (say what you will about their interpretation of Boston's Peace of Mind on Murder by Pride, but I thoroughly enjoyed that cover...does it count as a cover if the song writer is playing on the song?), this time it's the Doubie Brothers' Jesus Is Just Alright. If you are a big fan of the original, you may not like this. However, I strongly prefer this version with its strong metal approach. Very enjoyable.The CD opens with one of the best songs on the disc, Revelation. Very strong intro riffs leading into a verse and chorus that make it clear this is the \"new and improved\" Stryper.The title track has all the feel of a song from the one of their original albums, only it is better. The halting transitions are gone. The music flows more easily than it ever did back in the 80s. Yet, the power is all still there. It is interesting to note, and this song especially highlights it, that Michael Sweet's voice seems to have lost nothing with age, even though he never seems to hold anything back on any of these songs.A couple of other songs of note: Saved By Love is a very hard driving song, with Michael stretching is voice right to the limit; Te Amo is my personal favorite - it has a very catchy chorus with a lot of harmonies and very enjoyable guitars driving throughout the song; the album ends very well with the song Renewed - seems appropriate for the band!This should be a must for all Stryper fans. This should also be something you should take a listen to if you are a Christian rock fan and even an '80s metal fan. Nothing to dissappoint here."
A1ECYCW2U5TT74,B00EEPFLHE,1.0,"Awful sound quality. The whole thing cracks and sizzles, the highs are harsh and there's really bad sibilance. It's a shame because this is the comeback that Murder by Pride should have been."
A39KOJG83K8F1U,B00EEPFLHE,4.0,I don't believe in 5 stars unless it is like Zepplin IV so giving 4 is strong endorsement. This is the first Stryper album I got and I have to admit it took about 4 listens to sink in and about another 4 to really grow to love this. Get this!
A1HASYL2RRXN1O,B00EEPFLHE,5.0,"UPDATE: I wasted my last review grieving over the loss of most of the song Saved By Love due to Amazon MP3 messing up, but figured I should do a proper review.When Stryper themselves said they felt this was their best material to date - they weren't kidding! Their previous original album \"Murder By Pride\" still had a bit of the \"Reborn\" album sound attached. For those who didn't hear that album, Stryper was leaning more towards an alternative rock style which was unbecoming of a Stryper album in my personal opinion. Although that album had memorable songs and great hooks, it just didn't feel like Stryper. Here, Stryper really take it back to their roots while keeping it modern in tone and in mixing.Track by track:(NOTE: It's a bit redundant to praise the solos in a Stryper album because they've always been great at naturally weaving them into their songs. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed with the solos here.)1. \"Revelation\" - A heavy ballad of sorts with an incredible opening. I found it odd that the album started with this one considering they usually push out the heavy hitters right off the bat. Nonetheless, it still gets the job done by hooking you with it's grand intro and catchy chorus accompanied by the angelic harmonies of the layered vocals. Stryper are pros at this, it's scary good. The solo is on the tamer side but fits naturally into the flow of the song. Not too over-the-top and not underwhelming. Song closes with the epic opening riff.2. \"No More Hell To Pay\" - This song is understandably heavy handed in both riff progression and drumming pattern. Funny how it follows the theme of the song when its speaking on walking through this life with opposing voices and forces always weighing you down yet continuing to follow your path until there's \"No more hell to pay\". Michael Sweet gets to show off his vocal chops early-on in the pre-chorus, instantly reaching high notes with no warning. It's a great feat for his age. All in all a great song you'll be singing along to in no time flat.3. \"Saved by Love\" - This song is the most old-school sounding in the bunch in my opinion. Fast paced, raw, and aggressive. Stryper can still do all of these with perfection. Michael Sweets screams during the chorus compliment the mood so well it gets you pumped!4. \"Jesus Is Just Alright\" - I have to be honest. I didn't get the album \"The Covering\" since I'm usually annoyed when bands do covers. Although, Stryper did an amazing job with \"Shining Star\". The same has to be said with this Doobie Brothers original \"Jesus Is Just Alright\". They made it their own and not just by making a chord by chord remake. They made new riffs and progressions and even a breakdown. This is a great tribute to this song. Also the dueling guitars in the solo had me salivating... I can definitely tell when Michael is playing and when Oz jumps back in. They work so well together while at the same time having their own style and approach. It's fun to listen to these to duel. Even more fun live! =)5. \"The One\" - An intimate ballad with some great verse riffs courtesy of Oz Fox. The pre-chorus is a classic slow walk down that Stryper ballads are almost naked without and I love it! It leads into the heavenly harmonic \"ooohs\" that mimic the intro lead guitar hook. It sounds so great I had to re-play this song over 5 times on the first listen to hear it again! This song is so full of passion and love, I have to say that this rivals \"Honestly\". I couldn't tell you which one I love more, and I'm okay with that.Unfortunately I currently don't have time to post more but rest assured the rest of the album has just as much care, thought, passion, and perfection poured into it. This is a must have for all Metal fans."
A3VUYQ8GZY0B5W,B00EEPFNLS,5.0,"What can a person say about a good Melvins album?  If you're a Melvins fan you are probably going to get this album anyway, so it doesn't matter what I say.  If you have given up on the `Vins because of a stretch of weak albums here me out-  Plus, WTF are you doing here if you already gave up on them?? Anyway, long-time Melvins fans have probably noticed a few dips in the road- a few \"less than stellar\" albums if I may just come right out and say it.  You gotta love a group that has gone on a few decades never making it big, but yet influencing MANY.  They intentionally never made it big.  GnR got big and look at them now.  Thankfully not my Melvins!  You also gotta love that little kid that swings at every pitch- THAT'S the Melvins!!  I guess their theory is that you have to swing in order to knock a homerun out of the park, and that's exactly what they did on Tres Cabrones!!  Their catalogue was starting to go down gradually following Nude with Boots- I was beginning to forget why I was always eager for their next release, and I completely forgot what it feels like to enjoy listening to new Melvins release! If you are like me, you kind of suffered through the last few albums of theirs slowly losing hope.  Listening to Freak Puke was a real chore .  I would've bet everything I owned that Trevor Dunn PLUS that album title would = awesome!?! Well, we were wrong.  (of course Everybody Loves Sausages was good, but it was covers, so yeah...)Moving on, once you throw Tres Cabrones in, you will remember in the first 3 seconds how rewarding it can be to be diving into a solid new Melvins release for the first time!  It mixes all the best parts of your favorite albums: take 2 scoops of Stag, add smidgen of Houdini, a pinch of The Maggot (minus the repetitiveness, of course), a twist  of Stoner Witch, add just the right amount of Darkside of The Grave and dig in!!  Possibly my new favorite Melvins album, and an excellent starting point for Melvins Newbies!"
A3QYT7LYJ4H5FC,B00EF1PKJQ,5.0,"This is my third Sarah Jarosz CD and I love this one, too.  Her voice, musical accompaniment, arrangements, and style are all unusual without being \"weird.\"  Listening to her is refreshing."
A99LXWCJCKGH2,B00EF1PKJQ,3.0,"I've heard Sarah Jarosz on a couple different PBS shows, which got me excited over her music.  This CD was OK, but nothing great.  I really wish it had fewer words and more of her playing!  It's enjoyable enough and makes good background music, but I didn't find anything memorable about it."
A2R1CP3XWVQCI8,B00EF1PKJQ,5.0,"I recently discovered this album after seeing Sarah perform on Conan. I was blown away by the quality of the song and the performance. She is no popster selling sex over substance. Girl can play! She doesn't just strum, she plays her instrument. As a musician myself, I appreciate her technical ability.The songs on this album have a pretty suprising amount of depth. Lyrically, vocally, etc. The arrangement of the instruments is stunning. With just the right amount of verb, this album sounds open, big, and miles deep. Sometimes the space between the notes is the important part. Sarah and her collaborators have nailed this aspect on this particular album.I am a total rocker, and really haven't enjoyed much bluegrass or folk music beyond the Allison Krauss/Robert Plant record, but this is such a great piece of work it just transcends all that. Love it."
ATKG1O6O7PGR2,B00EF1PKJQ,4.0,"Sarah's 3 albums are evenly-spaced 2 years apart (2009; 2011; 2013) and show remarkable progress from one to the next, and none more so than between #2 Follow Me Down and this latest release, recorded during her final semester at the New England Conservatory. Her foundation in acoustic bluegrass roots that was so prominent in her debut Song Up in Her Head four years ago is more of a distant echo of the past on Build Me Up From Bones. The songwriting is more sophisticated, the lyrical content more mature and personal, the singing more polished, and the music composition much more adventurous, diving into eclectic blends of folk, jazz, love ballads and even a light touch of neo-psychedelia.Sarah made her name as a young mandolin prodigy and astounding vocalist with a musical sensibility far beyond her years. On this collection of 9 originals and 2 covers, she fulfills the early promise of her teenage years. The \"bluegrass wunderkind\" label has been relegated to the attic trunk - this is a fully-realized work of a grown woman with an old soul and 4 years of advanced musical education at a prestigious school that is tailored to help nurture geniuses in the field. By all accounts, NEC has served Sarah well. She has left her proverbial \"comfort zone\" behind.A word of caution: people expecting a bare-bones, stripped-down rustic sound centered around a banjo or mandolin (akin to her debut record) will get fewer examples of that on this record. Sarah's mando is featured here on just 1 track (Joanna Newsom's 'Book of Right On') and her clawhammer banjo only on 'Fuel the Fire.' The rest of the album is dominated by her preferred instruments: the Fletcher Brock octave-mandolin, and her acoustic guitar. Much has been said of the project emphasizing her live concert trio configuration (Alex Hargreaves on fiddle; Nat Smith on cello), and that is true on 6 of the 11 songs. The other 5 make extensive use of session musicians and electric instruments, including Jerry Douglas on Dobro, Kenny Malone on percussion, Chris Thile on mandolin and Dan Dugmore on pedal steel and electric guitars. Also, as on her 2 other albums, guest vocalists appear on harmony, as well as overdubbed multi-tracks by Sarah herself. With the exception of the Dylan cover 'Simple Twist of Fate' (using only Sarah's voice and Nat's cello plucked like a bass), the album makes good use of the studio's tools to flesh-out the songs beyond the minimalist trio setup. Producer Gary Paczosa even indulges in employing audio special-FX on some tracks like 'Fuel the Fire' and 'Rearrange the Art' that couldn't be reproduced live without a soundboard equipped with ProTools. In fact, the latter track, which closes out the album, has a slightly late-60's psychedelic vibe coupled with jazzy Bela Fleck banjo stylings that showcases how far Jarosz's musical palette has expanded since 2009. If her sophomore album Follow Me Down was her Rubber Soul, this album is her Revolver, with a similar broad range of genres and influences that pulls the listener in to territories with fresh musical visions, showing Sarah's journey is taking her towards new horizons.Ms. Jarosz is well on her way to establishing herself as a bona-fide original, creating a recognizable, idiosyncratic style drawn from numerous sources and forged into her own unique artistic identity."
A2HTF88O2QYO7D,B00EFBE0CO,5.0,"I hadn&#8217;t heard of Jake Owen before, but when this album popped up on my Amazon &#8220;recommended for you&#8221; and after checking him out on Youtube, I decided to take a chance and bought this album. I&#8217;m sure glad I did!With &#8220;Days Of Gold&#8221;, Jake Owen delivers a collection of 12 great country pop/rock tracks, eclectic enough to appeal to fans of many genres and one that makes you long for the summertime (it&#8217;s December as I write this review) and heading for the beach with a cooler full of beer, this album on the CD-player and &#8220;Beachin&#8217; &#8221; blasting out of the speakers.The opening song &#8220;Days Of Gold&#8221; instantly sets your feet to tapping, although the tune goes so fast it&#8217;s a bit hard to keep up and sing along. This is followed by the fun &#8220;Beachin&#8217; &#8220;, a quirky reggae-ish song with a bit of country-rap, perfectly suited to Owen&#8217;s Southern surfer personality.Before you think this album is only filled with songs about partying, drinking and fun in the sun, he shows his other, more emotional side in songs like &#8220;Life Of The Party,&#8221; a song about a break-up where he sings about &#8220;painting a smile on my face&#8221; and &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to know I&#8217;m all-alone&#8221; and the desperation-tinged &#8220;Drivin&#8217; All Night&#8221; as he sings &#8220;no way I&#8217;m stopping this Chevy, Red Bull&#8217;s keepin&#8217; my lead foot heavy&#8221; wishing to &#8220;hold you for a day&#8221;.All 12 tracks are great, but my personal favorites on this album are the nostalgic song &#8220;1972&#8221;, which creates the sort of eternal summer-vibe as in Bryan Adams&#8217; &#8220;Summer of &#8216;69&#8221; and has the same kind of hit-potential, the feel-good &#8220;One Little Kiss (Never Killed Anybody)&#8221; and the poignant piano ballad &#34;What We Ain't Got&#34; that really showcases his vocal capabilities.So grab a &#8220;Tall Glass Of Something&#8221;, sit back and listen to &#8220;Days of Gold&#8221;, as this is one album you are going to want in your CD-collection!"
A2KILNYE6LV4Y2,B00EFBE0CO,5.0,Jake does it again with his second cd I purchased. He is coming along nicely as an up and coming country artist. Great feal and different flavor to all the songs.
A2XOV3ZKGDK55G,B00EFFW0Z4,5.0,"Five MARVELOUS Stars! Multiple Grammy-nominated jazz diva Tierney Sutton uses her clear, sweet soprano and jazz sensibility to deliver, in my opinion, one of the greatest recordings of her career with \"After Blue\": a tribute to the legendary, high-influential singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell, using both original Mitchell compositions and songs of other composers which are associated with Joni. Tierney's liner notes say this Mitchell recording has been a decade in coming to fruition, as she steeped herself in the experience and appreciation of Joni's music and occasionally performed some of her songs in public. Stepping away from the Tierney Sutton Band for this occasion, she joins forces, in various combinations, with the strings of the Turtle Island Quartet, pianist Larry Goldings, flautist Hubert Laws, TSB bandmate acoustical bassist Kevin Axt, guitarist Serge Merlaud, drummer Peter Erskine, and special guest, vocal icon Al Jarreau on \"Be Cool\", among others.All tracks are excellent, and the 'best of the best' begins with the sumptuous, swirling \"Blue\" and \"Little Green\", both featuring Tierney soaring in both scat and vocal modes, showing off that incredible Sutton vibrato, with great support from the Turtle Island Quartet. \"All I Want\" is Tierney splendidly singing over a bed of pizzicato strings and drums. The stark duo contrast of Tierney's voice and Larry Goldings' piano works great on \"Court and Spark\" and \"Woodstock\", as Tierney hums and vocalizes these marvelous lyrics. The Joni Mitchell, Charles Mingus opus \"The Drycleaner from Des Moines\" has Tierney effectively trading improvised notes with Hubert Laws' hip flute and Goldings' soulful B3 organ. \"Big Yellow Taxi\" has, and only needs, outstanding propulsive brush and cymbal support from drummer Ralph Humphrey for an effective, humorous reading by Tierney. The dreamy \"Both Sides Now\" has the voice and cello of Sutton and Summer in full beautiful intertwined duo contrast. The lush, intimate \"Don't Go To Strangers\" has Tierney giving a very emotional reading of the Etta Jones classic with Kevin Axt on bass and Merlaud's lyrical guitar. In all, great performances by Tierney Sutton and friends, paying homage to the genius of Joni Mitchell, with excellent individual arrangements from \"Turtle\" cellist Mark Summer, David Balakrishnan, Julie Bernstein, Axt, Merlaud, and Tierney herself. My Highest Recommendation. Five BLUE Stars! (12 tracks; Time-58:00)"
A1M0WTTHW4VZPL,B00EFFW0Z4,3.0,"This disc has gotten rave reviews and I have always been intrigued by some of Joni Mitchell's stuff, so I took a flyer on this one. It has its moments, but is uneven and not highly recommended.First I should note my agreement with everyone who raves about Sutton's voice. Her pitch IS perfect and her sound is luminous - vibrato-free, no hard edges yet not breathy, rich and melodic. The range is only OK though.The scat in &#34;Blue&#34; didn't really work. Mitchell is a folk singer of sorts and all of her stuff doesn't really translate into jazz&#34;Big Yellow Taxi&#34; is ambitious - she tries to sing with only drums as company. This version doesn't have any melodic flow.The highlight of the album is a standard, &#34;Don't Go To Stangers&#34; - just beautiful.There are many musicians who have a single style or approach that works for them and others that sound good in a variety of settings. I suspect that Sutton falls in the former group - she should stick to singing ballads or standards with gentle music backing her up."
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B00EHTA06O,4.0,"Rhino Handmade gives the lavish box set treatment to THE MONKEES PRESENT album from 1969, and the fans who love The Monkeees will spend the expensive price tag for it. It's all done expertly well, with renowned Monkees curator, Andrew Sandoval, extracting virtually every surviving alternate mix, take and occasional unreleased track from the vaults. Out of 84 tracks, there are only 2 never before released songs, HOW CAN I TELL YOU and OPENING NIGHT. These 1969 tracks were left unfinished , but as the pickings are slim for totally unreleased songs, they are good to have, both being Davy Jones tracks. The original 12 track album is not their strongest album. In his liner notes, Sandoval explains the denouement of The Monkees in very informative, detailed fashion. It's hard to believe that they actually expanded PRESENT to 3 CD's when not even all 12 of the original album songs were all strong songs to begin with. The tracks by both Davy and Mike Nesmith are in abundance on this set. Micky Dolenz surprisingly has the least songs, with only a handful of bonus tracks in different mixes, all of which have been previously released, such as STEAM ENGINE, MIDNIGHT TRAIN and YOU'RE SO GOOD. ROSE MARIE turns up for the 7th time in another , hard to tell what's the difference in it mix. LITTLE GIRL is the most different as it is without Micky's multi-tracked vocals, featuring only 1 Micky vocal. Davy's songs I think are the most varied and strongest songs across this 3 CD set. Jones really composed a lot of his own songs during this period. The original album songs like FRENCH SONG and IF I KNEW are more mature sounding songs lyrically and musically. They feature more influences from other countries, and are more moody works that would fit perfectly on a film soundtrack. The abundance of songs by Davy include different mixes or takes that sound much clearer than the mixes used on the 3 volumes of MISSING LINKS, which is where virtually all of the \" bonus \" material on this set were originally issued in the late 80's. Davy's songs such as IF YOU HAVE THE TIME, MY STORYBOOK OF YOU, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, I NEVER THOUGHT IT PECULIAR and a host of others are both moody and joyous examples of Jones' talents. It makes you appreciate what he did in this life, making music that he loved, which a lot of people, millions , still love and listen to. His songs really stand out here as the foundation of this set.Mike Nesmith's amazing LISTEN TO THE BAND , widely regarded as one of the group's greatest recordings , which came too late in their career to be the big hit it deserved, is here in 4 different mixes. Most of his songs on this set have been previously released as well on the MISSING LINKS volumes. The other original album songs of his, like GOOD CLEAN FUN and NEVER TELL A WOMAN YES, were very weak songs to begin with , with little continuity, sense or melody. He explains in the liner notes how he came to write GOOD CLEAN FUN , which illustrate how some of the original songs on PRESENT were not even strong songs at all. I remember when I was a kid thinking how great it was to finally hear Nesmith do a song that was upbeat with a melody and chorus on Side 2 with OKLAHOMA BACKROOM DANCER [ written by Michael Martin Murphey who wrote  the amazing WHAT AM I DOIN' 'HANGIN' ROUND on album #4 ]. Nesmith had stronger songs than the dreadful NEVER TELL A WOMAN YES, and bonus songs like CALICO GIRLFRIEND SAMBA, ANGEL BAND, and DOWN THE HIGHWAY confirm that stronger songs were left behind on PRESENT. DOWN THE HIGHWAY is not an unreleased song, but is actually MICHIGAN BLACKHAWK from MISSING LINKS VOLUME 2. It's a big letdown that on CD 3, all of the unreleased songs except for the 2 Davy songs are backing track instrumentals only that Nesmith didn't record vocals for. The 1969 TV Mixes of KICKING STONES [ TEENY TINY GNOME ], APPLES PEACHES BANANAS & PEARS and other songs may sound enticing , but differ very little than their previously available versions.Monkees devotees will want this box, as Monkees fans are almost as obsessed to own these elaborate, expanded & expensive CD's as Rhino is for padding them with extra material . In reality, a 3 CD box set that has almost every song previously available, could have easily been a  2 CD set. Rhino released 2 CD sets of the first 4 Monkees albums , which were the Monkees biggest selling albums in their career, and made them available in stores.  To keep the continuity of the 3 CD box set that started with album #5, THE BIRDS, THE BEES AND THE MONKEES, and selling the sets only online, Rhino is really exploiting what little they have left in the Monkees vault. This will go out of print, as they manufactured only 5,000 copies. The Monkee faithful will want this, just as I bought it. For fans that aren't into the \" everything but the kitchen sink \" approach, the 1 CD version of PRESENT that Rhino issued years ago will do, as well as the MISSING LINKS volumes."
AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00EHTA06O,4.0,"The Monkees have had boxed sets for five of their releases each album has its merit but \"Present\" remains one of my favorite albums by the trio of Mike, Mickey and David.This deluxe three album set takes The Monkees album and fleshes it out with two discs of previous unreleased songs, unfinished recordings, remixes and alternate mixes.The material for the original album is quite good but the material that DIDN'T make the album is, in many cases, equally as good and, in some cases better. The first edition includes a limited edition 45rpm single with two remixes.There's also a nice oversized booklet with information on the recording of the album and the personnel for each session.As with previous editions Andrew Sandoval (who put this edition together) does a good job of collecting all the material for the boxed set. The remastering is quite good as well--to my ears it's an improvement over the original single CD release from Rhino.DISC ONE:1 Little Girl2 Good Clean Fun3 If I Knew4 Bye Bye Baby Bye Bye5 Never Tell A Woman Yes6 Looking For The Good Times7 Ladies Aid Society8 Listen To The Band (fake stereo mix)9 French Song10 Mommy And Daddy11 Oklahoma Backroom Dancer12 Pillow Time13 Time And Time Again (November 1969 stereo mix)14 Down The Highway (November 1969 stereo mix)15 Steam Engine (November 1969 stereo mix)16 If You Have The Time (November 1969 stereo mix)17 Angel Band (November 1969 stereo mix)18 Rose Marie (November 1969 stereo mix)19 I Never Thought It Peculiar (No strings & backing vocals - August 1969)20 Of You (November 1969 stereo mix)21 Kicking Stones (1969 mix)22 If I Knew (Bill & Davy's stereo mix)23 The Crippled Lion (November 1969 stereo mix)24 My Storybook Of You (Tommy & Bobby's stereo mix)25 Carlisle Wheeling (November 1969 stereo mix)26 French Song (LP master with alternate ending - stereo)27 Hollywood (stereo)28 My Storybook Of You (\"New\" 1969 stereo mix)29 Circle Sky (\"New\" 1969 stereo mix)30 Kool Aid spotDISC TWO:1 The Monkees Present radio spot2 If I Knew (TV Mix mono)3 Bye Bye Baby Bye Bye (mono)4 Looking For The Good Times (mono)5 Ladies Aid Society (1969 mono mix)6 Listen To The Band (single mix)7 French Song (TV mix mono)8 Mommy & Daddy (1969 mono mix)9 Circle Sky (1969 \"New\" mono mix)10 Penny Music (TV mix mono)11 Apples, Peaches, Bananas And Pears (1969 mono mix)12 Of You (1969 mono mix)13 I Never Thought It Peculiar (1969 mono mix without overdubs)14 Kicking Stones (1969 mono mix)15 Listen To The Band (LP version true mono mix)16 If You Have The Time (1969 mono mix without Moog)17 Midnight Train (TV mix mono)18 My Storybook Of You (mono)19 Steam Engine (mono)20 Time And Time Again (November 1969 mono mix)21 Mommy & Daddy (7/1/69) stereo mix 322 I Never Thought It Peculiar (September 1969 mono mix with overdubs)23 Bye Bye Baby Bye (July 1969 stereo mix)24 If You Have The Time (1969 mono mix with Moog)25 Mommy & Daddy (7/2/69) stereo mix26 Time And Time Again (November 1969 alternate mono mix)27 Monkees Greatest Hits radio spotDISC THREE:1 Little Girl (take 7)2 Calico Girlfriend3 If I Knew (take 11)4 You're So Good (alternate mix)5 Little Red Rider (alternate mix)6 If You Have The Time (take 4)7 Music Bridge \"We'll Be Back In A Minute\" (take 12)8 Listen To The Band (alternate stereo mix)9 French Song (take 3)10 Mommy And Daddy (May 13, 1969 stereo mix 9)11 Thank You My Friend (backing track - take 4)12 Pillow Time (Takes 8 & 9)13 How Can I Tell You14 Steam Engine (1969 rough stereo mix)15 Time And Time Again (take 1)16 Good Afternoon (take 14)17 Opening Night18 Lynn Harper (backing track - take 8)19 Music Bridge \"We'll Be Back In A Minute\" (take 18)20 The Good Earth (alternate take)21 London Bridge (backing track - take 4)22 Music Bridge \"We'll Be Back In A Minute\" (version three)23 A Bus That Never Comes (backing track - take 9)24 Omega (backing track - take 8)25 13 Is Not Our Lucky Number (backing track)26 Michigan Blackhawk (backing track - take 4)27 Little Tommy Blues (backing track - take 5)28 Till Then (backing track - take 2)VINYL 45:A Good Clean Fun (alternate mix with extra percussion)B Mommy & Daddy (7/10/69) mono mixI suspect this will be the last of the expanded editions as the sessions for the bulk of the other tracks for the next album \"Changes\" have been lost or are destroyed.This is (at present)$59.99 at Rhino's Monkees website.."
AV0HQTP53LBB0,B00EIEPCRA,4.0,"First let me say I've never owned an Anberlin cd, just had their song Unstable (which is still my favorite after now owning this one). Second, their music is very good, just a little more in the pop genre than I am used to (I'm more of a heaver rocker). Also if you listen to the album from first song to last all the songs seem to sound the same. But other than that, worth the five bucks I bought it with."
A1JS6N2DYU3NL0,B00EIEPCRA,5.0,I just love this type of music.  It's soft and soothing to me. If you like enya then you will like this.
A3DDARC4NY1JOH,B00EIEPDKQ,5.0,"I like this album. I wasn&#8217;t to big of a fan of &#34;Revival&#34; being the follow up to &#34;Lucky 7&#34; which was I thought was great, and even less of a fan of &#34;Laughin and Cryin&#34;. I think it&#8217;s hard to rate a RHH release simply because they&#8217;ve been around so long and over the years have released different styles so you have diverse fans who prefer certain releases/songs over others. I was in my early teens when I first heard the RHH on a Sub Pop compilation and remember seeing their psychobilly freak-out video on Beavis and Butthead&#8230; now I&#8217;m in my 30&#8217;s and have heard all they&#8217;ve done. About this release &#8220;REV&#8221;&#8230; It&#8217;s mostly rockabilly/rock style songs versus the country style they have released in recent past. I think if you liked releases like A Night in the Box and Lucky 7 you&#8217;ll probably like this one. It starts of with &#8220;Victory&#8221; and rolls into &#8220;Smell of Gasoline&#8221; (like how the instrumental Big Sky starts off to Baddest of the Bad&#8230;..hopefully this will be their new start to their live sets like Big Sky/Baddest were for so many years), and has the surf style instrumental &#8220; Zombie Dumb&#8221; (containing few lyrics like their song Marijuana), the song &#8220;My Hat&#8221; reminds me of something off of A Night in the Box. Overall the album is good. It does have one or two songs I feel I will skip (like Hardscrabble Woman) after a few listens in its entirety (but skipping 1 or 2 out of 13 songs makes for a good release in my eyes), but for the most part it is upbeat, fast paced rock/rockabilly and I&#8217;m happy to have it after the long period since Lucky 7.On a side note, I was REALLY surprised to see they are with Victory Records now which is (or was) exclusively hardcore bands.To comment on the 2 star review&#8230;.the RHH have always put out weird and amusing songs, so not sure why someone would think &#8220;Let me Teach you How to eat&#8221; would be any different. After a listen to that, it&#8217;s just another sexually innuendo loaded song that they are known for&#8230;.remember &#8220;Big Red Rocket of Love&#8221;, &#8220;One Time for Me&#8221;, &#8220;Wiggle Stick&#8221;, not to mention &#8220;Nurture my Pig&#8221;?...why would this song be any different? Teach you how to Eat is right up there with Big Red Rocket of Love as far as fast paced rockabilly style."
A3MACIC3T09VW,B00EIEPF90,5.0,"There is an awful lot to like about Jonathon Wilson. He is so into the music, and the sound, and the history. Fanfare takes up where the last album left off, and is almost as varied. On a number of levels, this is full of tributes - west coast music, psychedelia, alt-country and so on. Very likeable, with some spirited guitar playing as well. I could personally do with a little less referencing of early Pink Floyd, but it is pointless quibbling with a total fan. One of the best albums of the year."
A2ECSD673EMYVB,B00EIEPNWO,5.0,"Lucius REALLY grow on you!  This CD is one that you must listen to all the way through as it just is amazing how this group with its  original lyrics, new percussion and harmonies send your mind to new dimensions.  Check their videos on You Tube, especially &#34;Tempest&#34;, another original, well produced concept."
A3MGKU008K95W9,B00EIEPOXC,4.0,"Angry, awesome, thrash with some melody. This band is very underrated - the performances here are fantastic - and I am not a fan from day one. I only own the post re-union material. ...edit - two months later and the album continues to deliver. Lot's of depth - lots of fun."
A383HZH9F6P348,B00EIEPOXC,1.0,"Sup Sup yall! I'm a diehard metalhead.. my favorite bands are Slipknot, Bleeding Through, As I lay crying, and that one guy that does Gangnam Style... but lately the metal scene has been falling off the charts... I can't seem to find ANY good metal with the exception of \"gangnam style\" and \"what does the horse say\"... I find this band to be very generic and the singer can't sing a note to save his life! Dead Angel must learn to play good music if they want to be on MTV... and this debut album isn't anywhere near MTV-quality....So folks, avoid this Dead Angel crap and stick with guys who know how to rock... Oopan Gangnam Style!!"
ACG9VLB5JCN1D,B00EIEPOXC,5.0,"I love this record, it reminds me of the classic thrash records of the 80's, think Flotsam, Exodus, etc.  But it has the modern tone and sound.  They still have it, this band, and while their records vary (take a listen to Act III, a more acoustic album with a more broadening appeal) this will definitely please those that enjoy a great hard rock record with great guitar riffs, and vocals, also lyrically it was pleasing as well, some great concepts.  This is a shred fest, that is great fun to listen to and the songs are solid.  It's nice to have some new thrash type music to listen to."
A2XDMEL1NK0L0D,B00EIGQK4C,4.0,"I've been listening to and playing worship music for over 15 years, and it's getting really, really difficult to find worship music that is fresh and exciting for me these days.  Enter Dustin Kensrue, main creative force behind the excellent band Thrice.  It's a fairly straight forward worship album, but brings in some indie and post rock elements that help it stand apart.  Stand out tracks are Rejoice, Rock of Ages, and God is Good.  Definitely check this one out if you are looking for a little more artistry in your worship music collection"
A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B00EIGQK4C,5.0,"Prime Cuts:  Rock of Ages, Rejoice, The Voice of GodThere is no auto-correct on God's iPhone.  He doesn't need the \"delete\" key on His PC.  This is because in every task, be it ruling the universe or the next phase in your career, God has a laser-sharp perspicuity on how His would execute His plans.  And to transport the front man of alternative rock band Thrice Dustin Kenrue to cut his first worship record \"The Water and the Blood\" is freighted with wisdom.  Often by default worship leaders have adopted the standard fare anthemic pop template utilized by Darlene Zschech, Hillsong, Matt Redman and Martin Smith.  As a result, many a times worship music has isolated worshippers whose taste of music don't exactly fit the cookie cutter mold stultifying adopted by these worship leaders.  Thus, this is where Kensrue's latest effort feeds the lacuna.  Coming from a hardcore rock base where Kensrue fronted Thrice over 8 albums and over a time span of 14 years, Kensrue approaches worship music with much needed freshness.  Precisely because he has entered worship music via a different door, the songs on \"The Water and the Blood\" avoid all the standard clich&eacute;s of many worship songs.  And Kensrue has deliberately alienated himself those predictable hooks many worship albums have plagiarized from Hillsong Live or Matt Redman.  Rather, what we have here are 11 songs that sound revived, vital and invigorated.During his hiatus from Thrice, Kensrue currently serves as worship pastor leading weekly worship at Mars Hill Church Bellevue.  Together with other worship pastors of the same parent church Mars Hill, they have worked out a deal with BEC Recording/Mars Hill Music to release a series of records.  Following the recent releases of Citizens and Ghost Ship, Kensrue's \"The Water and the Blood\" is the third installment.  The titular \"The Water and the Blood\" (a line taken from the song \"Rock of Ages\") is most telling.  According to Kensrue, they are the two themes that run right across the record.  First, the theme of the forgiveness Christ offered on the Cross via the shedding of his blood.  And, second, the theme of Jesus as the eternal water who quenches all our thirst.  Both themes beautifully converge on the album opener \"Rejoice.\"  Starting off with crunchy guitars and a stately bass line, Kensrue bursts off with full adrenaline by the time the chorus hits.  \"Rejoice\" is celebratory of the atonement we have received gorgeously captured by Kensrue's expressive tenor.Just like his label mate Ghost Ship who had cut a re-imaged version of the hymn \"Holy, Holy, Holy,\" here Kensrue's choice is \"Rock of Ages.\"  Writing a new tune while still utilizing most of the lyrics of this ancient classic, Kensrue brings new life to this liturgical post-rock piece.  \"Suffering Servant\" serves notice as to how fine a songwriter Kensrue is.  While many a lesser composer would have boycotted the theological density of what the blood of Christ actually does on our behalf, Kensrue delves right into the mire.  With erudition yet with a heartfelt lucidity that even the unschooled can understand, \"Suffering Servant\" is one of the best theological treatise on the Cross set to music.  In our self-made world where most salary bonuses are based on our performances, \"It's Not Enough\" is so liberating to listen to.  For in God's economy, the very fact that God loves us has nothing to do with our sales figures or GPA or waist size.  Rather, we are loved simply by God's unmerited grace. The line \"I could walk the world forever 'till my shoes were filled with blood. It's not enough. It's not enough\" is just spine chilling.As far as creativity goes, Kensrue deserves every point of excellence.  \"The Voice of God\" is a track that calls to mind Psalm 29 where the Psalmist litanies how powerful God's voice is over creation.  However, when listening to this song one gets the feeling that Kensrue's vocals have been recorded in an empty hall with the reverbs of his voice glowing and fading throughout the song.  This brilliantly brings out the miraculous drama of God's utterances that Psalm 29 speaks about.  On the other hand, \"It is Finished\" aptly closes the album.  This song finds Kensrue in his electrifying rock n' roll best where the album double themes are celebrated via a party of a screeching guitars' fest.  Adventurous in its execution, faithful in its allegiance to God's word, and genuinely animated as far as worship goes, \"The Water and the Blood\" is indeed a gem."
A1AL15PY5AVFNX,B00EIGQKB0,4.0,"4th album from Denton, Texas band who play music that somehow feels epic and serious, with asense of history and depth.  Maybe it&#8217;s the meticulous arrangements or the dark Americana/folkovertones or the subtle psychedelic rock base.  Maybe it&#8217;s the excellent songwriting or thesoothing vocal harmonies or the gently dramatic instrumental journeys.  It&#8217;s the kind of musicthat&#8217;s comfortable, but never boring&#8212;like sitting in your favorite armchair, all dreamy but wideawake.  Shades of Blitzen Trapper, Fleet Foxes, Grandaddy, Arbouretum, Iron & Wine, Calexico."
A3ZSG9NSI4RPI,B00EIN6L76,5.0,"my daughter hasn't stopped listening to this since it hit the mailbox.  I must admit i did &#34;peek&#34; into a few of the songs and they were rather good.  the dealer was on time, great price and without a hitch.  also, they have created mabny peaceful hours in my home.....thank you!"
AZC562U18BK2S,B00EIPILC2,5.0,"As an untrained layman, my choice for a full set of Nielsen symphonies is Blomstedt's, recorded with the S.F. Symphony. And, for at least a partial cycle, Leonard Bernstein's vintage recordings on Sony are on the shelf as well. This set, conducted by Ole Schmidt, is also from several years back and was one of my treasured possessions when I picked it up decades ago, in the First Age of Vinyl. There is a roughness in the playing that has the smack of authenticity, and if the sound isn't up to modern standards, well, I don't notice it much, being swept up in the performances. I wouldn't tout this now as the top choice, but for the price and the interpretations, this probably ought to be on your shelf. In disc form, it's now back on mine."
A2AIMXT9PLAM12,B00EIPILC2,5.0,"I hope every music lover gets a chance to be swept away by Carl Nielsen's symphonies the way I was in college when Leonard Bernstein brought out his thrilling recording of Sym. #3, the Espasiva. Although he belongs securely to Denmark, Nielsen contributed a unique sound to modern symphonic writing, as Nordic as Sibelius, as melodic as Vaughan Williams,  and (at times) as mordant as Prokofiev.  Bernstein basically introduced a composer that few American listeners knew at all, but in the background was a series of Danacord 78s that rival his performance for thrust and excitement.So does Ole Schmidt - you only have to hear how he brings no. 6, the very un-simple &#34;Sinfonia simplice,&#34; creating a searing impression that leaves every other modern reading from Ormandy to blomstedt, Schonwandt, and Colin Davis standing at the gate.  His reading is truly re-creative and not to be missed. Almost as good is his rollicking swing in the first movement of the Espansiva, coming as close to Bernstein - and the old Danacord originals - as anyone I've ever heard.  The exuberant playing of the LSO, hired out in 1974 by Unicorn to make this cycle, is somewhat oddly recorded, sounding very spotlit in solos and recessive when massed strings enter; there is considerable resonance, but not so much that it bothered me.You can sample Schmidt's urgent, propulsive interpretations on a single CD that pairs Nielsen's acknowledged masterpieces, Sym. #4 and $5, but this box set is so cheap it's worth it to get the whole cycle.  It's not as if the Fourth and Fifth have been shortchanged on disc, with major recordings by Salonen, Karajan, Barbirolli, and  Bernstein at hand -  I've treasured the Bernstein Fifth as one of the outstanding Nielsen releases of the past fifty years - but Schmidt never relents in his dramatic intensity. For that he deserves a special place."
A1LOACNK0QV9T4,B00EJ96Z98,5.0,"So happy this cd was made available for everyone's enjoyment! I attended this concert last year and it was so incredible. Alfie Boe has one of the most amazing voices I have ever heard and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is simply the best choir in the world. They really complimented each other. &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; brought tears to my eyes. Hearing him sing this is always amazing, but actually watching him perform it was an opportunity of a lifetime."
A3S23AAGK66SPP,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,I really liked this. Far more than I thought I would. I liked Royals but the radio kind killed it. But then I heard Glory and Gore on the Vikings Season 2 commercial and had to know what song it was. There a lot of songs on here that I really like. Her voice is hypnotic too.
A174N61OTOW83P,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"Judging by her lyrics, Lorde wants to take over pop.  That would be fine with me.The music is highly consonant, with strong rhythm and melody elements.  These are often in the lower registers.  Dynamics and transient attacks are used sparingly and to great effect.  Orchestration runs from simple and pure to complex and interactive.  The result is a powerful, convincing musical landscape that draws you in from start to finish.This is an album that stands as a complete whole.  It has no skip-that-track moments.  The worst song is still good, and all of them together make a single work of art.The melodic, structural, and lyrical elements are vastly more mature, honest about self, and insightful than most of what I see in popular music.  It has a Gen-X quality of cynical honesty combined with a Gen-Y sense of hope and determination.  People in their 40s will \"get\" this music at least as much as teens.I bought the LP, which is well pressed and well presented.  The sound is fantastic.  There is a download code, and Amazon also supplies the \"auto-rip\" service, so you can listen to the digits while you wait at the mailbox for your record."
A1IBI2MEBTZLGF,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"It's nice to know that as time goes by the best may be yet to come.Lorde steels herself on Pure Heroine against praise or blame on both the opening and final songs on the album. On the first song, she starts out, \"Don't you think it's boring how people talk?\". On the last song, after repeating the phrase \"people are talking\" over and over, she closes, with, \"Let them talk.\"If you liked \"Royals\" and want to hear some more equally exciting music, do get the album. Every song is as good, if not better. I bought this record because I heard it playing on a public address system, and was first captivated by the opening song's electronic ambiance, plunging synthesizer chords, and cryptic chorus, \"Baby be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears, it's a new art form, showing how little we care, yeah.\" I thought, wow that is really great, and then was amazed that the next song was just as good, as was the next and the next one, right up to the close. The consistency bowled me over. There's no doubt that co-writer,-producer Joel Little and Lorde had an intense but fun time making it, and they mean it to be an engaging record on every track, from start to finish.\"Royals,\" which to some extent succeeds, I think, in puncturing a few highly deserving-to-be-deflated popular music trends, may be the most upbeat song on the disc. (\"400 Lux has a fabulous rocking beat, but not without a bleak edge to it). This might account for the opinion of other reviewers here that the other songs are weaker. I found many of the other songs stronger in musical terms; but in emotional terms they are relatively serious, moody,  introspective. In \"Royals,\" Lorde turns towards popular culture and mocks it; satire is fun, so \"Royals\" is more engaging than the rest of the songs. These, by turns, are introspective, quirky, melancholy, bittersweet, juvenile, and self-absorbed-- and so, in terms of accessibility, not as listener-friendly. They offer rewards and invite you to go below the surface, though. It's not exactly clear what 400 Lux is about, something to do with going out and driving around in the car, it seems, which is a timeless rock and roll theme. But maybe there's more. I read an interpretation at songmeanings.com about a connection in the images with heroin-usage that was fairly convincing and put a few things in the song in perspective. \"World Alone\" goes from decrying bullying in the internet age to reminding the bullies and us all that \"one day we'll all be still.\"One complaint I've read in a few reviews is that being a wee teenager Lorde's lyrics are tediously overladen with grousing about getting old. From the evidence in these songs, though, that's a broad topic. The loss may sometimes the hardest at the age she wrote these songs, as she puts into words on the song \"Ribs.\" There is more left behind around that age than we'll ever leave behind again. Most of the mockers are simply old people I think, which proves the point. It's called self-awareness.Another complaint I've noted is that the songs all sound the same. This gripe, I understand to some extent. There is a similarity in instrumentation and production throughout, which can seem monotonous. However, in musical terms of rhythm, harmony, & melody, and lyric wise, Pure Heroine is an adventure throughout. Plenty of different musical designs are explored and taken on, and some of the results are impressive feats of musical conception and execution. I think it may be they didn't have too much to work with production-wise and made the best of what they had. \"Royals\" wasn't backed by a lot of money; rather, it went to the top on its own merits. I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do next, now they have a lot more production options.I think the vocals on this record are some of the greatest ever put on a pop record. I was struck, on my first hearing of \"Royals\" on the radio that the quality of the vocals was unprecedented. Lorde has a disciplined, agile, and, often quite pretty, voice, the power of which she plays out generally in carefully crafted backgroud parts. Although she sings in a sultry, baby-talking low range most of the time on lead vocals, her voice is stellar from highest to lowest notes. In some songs, if you didn't know all the voices were all Lorde, you'd think that she had assembled the most astoundingly talented backup singers of all time (\"Still Sane,\" for example).I don't want to be totally all-raving about the Pure Heroine (even though I think this is one of the greatest records ever made). It has some weaknesses.  There's a tendency on Pure Heroine to not take the effort to fashion an ending to the songs. Most of them come to an abrupt stop, or sound like they got exhausted and passed out. Happening  on one song, this might be a novelty. Happening on about all of the songs, it tends to be a dull signature and conveys a lack of imagination. (She neatly sidesteps this with a beautiful faux-ending on \"400 Lux\".) Also, the musical stylings, as noted above, are not very broad.  Her co-songwriter, I read, moved Lorde along paths he has long admired, those that were pioneered by Prince and maybe another couple of soul crossover artists in the 80's. (The ghost of \"Little Red Corvette\" lurks here and there.) I really loved that music, so I'm not complaining. I'm hoping that later Lorde will surprise us with something in a totally different sound setting, retaining rhythm, vocals, & melody just as sympathetic and compelling as they are here. The playing though is superb. The album sleeve credits Joel Little, Lorde's co-writer and producer on all instruments. He gives their songs the care they deserve. Bass, drums, percussion, keyboards. It's quite a feat. There is an interplay between the music and the vocals throughout, with the former attentive to the latter, sometimes on percussion especially.The vocals sound to me like a high point in any time. If pop singing gets any better than this, I'll love to hear it.  The melodies she sings can be quite catchy and winning, with a frankness and gentleness that is really moving. She's setting a new standard for what pop singing can attain. At times, it sounds like some of the singing is peaking up to the upper layers of pop vocal arrangement towards symphonic choral work.There's so much to like about this record if you are into this sort of thing. God bless the child."
A2I8F8MLEHRDV,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,this cd  rocks. she has an amazing voice for such a young girl. happy that  I got it. go get it
AI8M1XXGTES1G,B00EJU8ZIG,4.0,Liked this a lot. If you are looking for pop-ish music with an edge this is a good album to consider.
A30G8SGUPL9XLE,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,Bought this CD for just one of her songs and ended up liking the whole thing.  Has a laid back feeling to it which is nice after work on the long drive home.  :-)
A2EQXE1P0IN71T,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,I'm impressed with this girl. These are good songs. It will be interesting to see where her music goes from here.
A2268M0OG49GJ0,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,I'm just like the rest of you.  I love this music.  Great quirky stuff.  If you like Royals there are many more on here that will stick in your ear.
A2BEZ13IRQHDJV,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,Lorde is a wonderful artist and this is a wonderful sophomore release. Not as raw as her first release in NZ but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.
A3KO47BCGLFCZT,B00EJU8ZIG,4.0,"Sometimes sweet, sometimes sour, always interesting and only occasionally sentimental, Lorde's lyrics belie her age with their visual vividness and askance storytelling.Perhaps the best example of these tendencies on \"Pure Heroine\" is with the closing track, \"A World Alone\", which blends Lorde's verbal imagery with a sugary mix of musical hooks, resulting in a danceable, yet lyrically somber snapshot of isolation and love.Joel Little, the unsung \"other half\" of Lorde, uses minimalistic electronica throughout \"Heroine\" to provide an antiseptic but spacious environment for Miss Ella Yelich-O'Connor's stacked vocals.On \"A World Alone\", Mr. Little's clever combination of guitar phrasing and backbeat starts-and-stops combine with Lorde's \"Ooh-Ooh-Ooh-Oooooohhh-Ooh-Ohh\" scatting and a sub-chorus of \"The people are talking, people are talking\" to create an addictive burst of ear-candy that, combined with Lorde's alone-at-the-party lyrics, alternates between being both sour and sweet.The closing lines: \"One day the blood won't flow so gladly. One day we'll all get still. Get still.\""
A1195P733TGRQM,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,I saw her on ELLEN and loved her sound. Listened to some samples and continued to love her. Very easy on the ears...great sound she makes.
A2EEJEU6VC6IL8,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"Every song on this album is amazing, hands down.  If you like/love Royals I'm confident you'll enjoy every song on this album.  I don't even consider Royals one of my favorite songs; my favorites include Tennis Court, Buzzcut Season, Team (totally my fav fav), and A World Alone.  Such a mellow sound throughout the album with quality lyrics."
A3BJ86N14LHYSA,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"Lorde's voice is very mysterious and involving.  You want to listen.  You want to hear it again.  It's all planned very well.  All the ups and downs, pauses and vocal changes draw you in.  Love the dj... if that's what you'd call it.  Top notch Lorde.  Can't wait for the next success."
A209GQ2JOL7ZA3,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"Album full of wonderful tracks.  If you love female vocals, you need to try this album out.  I listen to it every day as I drive to and from work.  Lively, and upbeat!!!"
A28QBMCWQPHAMN,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,"Really good album and love all the songs.  I always loved Royals and was extremely excited that this entire album is very good.  Not a youngster, I was pleasantly surprised and the depth of this young singers insight on the world today and how she translated that into her music.  Lorde has not resulted to profanity or outrageous lyrics to get her message across with is refreshing in a new artist."
A2BUPVAQ8NN7EU,B00EJU8ZIG,5.0,Lorde will be with us for some time to come. Neither her voice nor her lyrics seem to be from such a young artist. I cannot wait to hear what else she brings us.
A29LA71LFJPJ87,B00EJYGO3A,5.0,"You probably hear the title of my review from any decent record that comes out, but I really mean it. I'm an avid hip hop listener who likes mainstream artist like Drake as well as deep underground acts like YC the Cynic and Oddisee. So I'm pretty well versed. But enough about me, onto this record Black Milk has blessed us with.I'll start with the production. It's excellent. Sounds like something Dilla would have produced. Deeply layered, soulful beats. Black Milk produced all but one of these songs. Usually when a rapper produces the majority of his album the results are lackluster. Take a look at Born Sinner by Cole that also came out this year. Cole decided that he would produce the album his self and the lyrics are underwhelming and the beats are very forgettable and simple. This is not an issue with NPNP. Black Milk tells great stories, combined with the wordplay he is known for. On songs like Sunday's Best, he tells the story of how his father would get him up for church on Sunday's, when he \"would rather be home video gaming.\" It's honest, relatable words to anyone that had a religious upbringing. It's a very introspective, revealing record that peers into Black Milks earlier life and what his future holds. Money Bag's talks about how life is a hustle and you have to get your money up to make it in this world. That's the thing you like about artist like this. They aren't \"big timing\" so they are much more relatable, because they struggle as well. That fact shows through in their lyrics. The insecurities, uncertainties of life.In conclusion, this is a strong 5/5 album for me. It has no flaws, in my opinion. Strong production, great lyrics. Above all, it's very fun and entertaining, which is ultimately the point of music. Highly recommended"
A1QPYAYVHDX7EV,B00EK3EFEA,5.0,"Quite possibly!  I saw Diane twice live when Bible Belt came out and was very impressed.  Nothing But A Miracle was sublime.  Then, she vanished.  Now 4 years later we have a very mature Diane who is very different and yet the same.  This release hasn't lost any of her magic while expanding it with great depth and beats!  Echoes of Kate Bush, Annie Haslam, Stevie Nicks, Paula Cole and so many others.  No, this isn't Diane imitating them or performing a tribute to them.  This is an amazing tapestry and distillation of them and so much more yet this is DIANE!  Buy this CD at any cost.  It will make many best of year end lists and, if there is any justice, you will hear many of these songs on the radio for a long time to come.  The DELUXE version is the way to go as no song is weak and this is the best example of a DELUXE version being truly DELUXE!"
ANMA1H8LGEVBF,B00EKQ3YZI,4.0,"I've loved nearly everything that has come from Donna in all its iterations and styles, though my favorite has always been her much earlier music from Moroder/Bellote. This album is a worthy effort to take all those great tunes and remix most of them them in a way that keeps their wonderful vocalistic stylings of Donna, yet make them unique and electronically upbeat and trippy.  I especially love the Cox/Moroder remix of Love to Love You and the Afrojack remix on I Feel Love. Powerful and fun. Unique and yet they still keep the same elements that made the originals so awesome and perfect.The newly released La Dolce Vita reminds me sort of \"I'm a Fire\".  Not my favorite Donna tune, but a nice addition.A few disappointments though:1) the decision to use another vocalist on Working the Midnight Shift, one of my all time favorites.  The vocalist sounds close enough to Donna (after remixing and such...) that I'm surprised they just didn't use Donna's vocals for the entire song, instead of just adding a small snippet of her soaring vocals in the middle).  The remix itself is not bad at all, just ashame they didn't use Donna for the entire song.2) The MacArthur Park remix.....I'm not a big fan of the \"Victor Calderone-y\" pounding remixes, and the MacArthur Park mix is typical of L. Luke's (and V. Calderone's) style.  Giving that the original song is a soaring ballad, I'm thinking they could have laid off the typical pots and pans a bit more.3) The I Feel Love Benga Remix -  The Benga remix of I Feel Love just doesn't have enough vocals and loses the Moroder up and down repetitive synthesizer notes that echo throughout the original song. Luckily this album included the Afrojack mix which is much, much better.4) The Dim All the Lights remix - Just don't care for it.  Dim All the Lights was one of the first Donna Summer self-penned tunes that nearly made it to number one but was bumped out of the spot by, guess what?  The Enough is Enough collaboration with B. Streisand...go figure. Anyway, this was one of my favorite Donna tunes and the remix captured none of that original feel or tune I fell in love with.5) On The Radio remix.....just don't care for it.  Retains little of the original tune and is sort of on the dark side.....Other than those misses, I really do like the album and it's nice that this gives me another Donna \"fix\" to get me through my workouts.  Donna will be greatly missed and this is a worthy effort to keep her music alive and well for generations to come."
AUDHM09PQZ2OV,B00EKQ3YZI,4.0,"The new remix album, \"Love to Love You Donna\" contains 13 cuts, of which one is a 'new' song that was recorded shortly before Donna Summer's death in 2012.  For the most part, the album is enjoyable, though none of the remixes outshine the original recordings.  As with any remix album, there are highs and lows.  First, the good:Giorgio Moroder's reworking of \"Love to Love You, Baby\" amps up the bass and the tempo and sprinkles in a few musical samples from his 70's work including \"I Feel Love\" and \"Utopia.\"  While this production doesn't veer too far from the original, it is a fun listen.Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper tackle \"Hot Stuff\", stripping the song of its original 'rock' element and turning the sultry 'come on' into an airy, late-night groove.  Totally listenable, though the sexual tension and immediacy of the original is lost in the remix.\"Bad Girls,\" as remixed by Gigamesh, retains the playfulness of the original recording, as well as most of the vocals.  It's a fun, bouncy reinvention that is sure to fill a dance floor or two.The Masters at Work remix of the seminal \"Last Dance\" begins awkwardly (the vocals don't match the beat), but eventually synchs up and manages to build to a powerful crescendo about three-fourths through the cut.  Give this one a chance and you will play it often.Both the Afrojack and Benga remixes of the electronic classic \"I Feel Love\" are pleasant but don't really add anything we haven't heard before in every remix of the song that has been released since Patrick Cowley's version in the early 80's.  I'm not sure anyone could improve on the original.And finally, \"Working the Midnight Shift,\" as imagined by Holy Ghost, is the absolute best cut on the album, with a very current backing track and a vocal by Tiffany Roth.  This production would sound right at home on any urban radio station today.  While it would have been nice to have Donna Summer's original vocals, I'm assuming they simply were not available in a format that allowed for a clean-sounding, modern production.  In addition to the stellar backing track, the song works well since it was never a hit single and is not competing with the memory of Top 40 days gone by.And now for the rest:Both Duke Dumont's \"Dim All the Lights\" and Jacques Greene's \"On the Radio\" are curious mis-steps that retain none of the fun of the original recordings (or much of the vocals or melody).  For completists only.Chromeo's take on \"Love is in Control\" is competent and current, but the original song wasn't very good to begin with so the ridiculous lyrics are made even moreso in this stripped down version.  The original song  made the US pop chart based solely on the reputation of the participants (it was produced by then super-hot Quincy Jones) and fell off the Top 40 chart like a ton of bricks after peaking at #10.Laidback Luke's remix of \"MacArthur Park\" is pure cheese and really illustrates that the best way to present a dance version of this complex song is exactly how it was done by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte in 1978.  Painful to the ears in either the dub or full vocal versions.I love Hot Chip, but their version of \"Sunset People\" slows down the tempo of the original to the point that it is boring.  They have managed to turn one of Donna's most frenetic and exciting songs into a mind-numbing, lethargic mess despite the fact that they had the original vocal track and musical stems from which to build a new song.  Yikes.And finally, the 'new' song \"La Dolce Vita.\"  I really was hoping that this tune was going to be on par with Donna's classics, but the best thing about it is the hooky refrain.  The production of the backing track is quite good, but the lyrics of the verses are repetitive and simple-minded, which ultimately sink the track.  It is, however, nostalgic to hear Moroder on the vocoder and serves as okay background music.Many fans are complaining that the remixes don't do justice to the legacy of Donna Summer.  I'm guessing the complainers haven't played the best cuts loud on a home stereo or are so stuck in the 70's that they can't accept that these remixes were really made to capture a new, younger audience.  They definitely sound amazing at full volume and are sure to get you up and dancing if you give them a chance."
A2M0S1B4I2S4SJ,B00EKQ3YZI,2.0,"I am a remix fan.  I love club mixes and new interpretations of songs.  This cd falls WAY short.  If you are looking for good extended mixes, look for &#34;The Dance Colleciton&#34;, original extended mixes."
AHW4RUI1861PE,B00EKQ3YZI,2.0,Not very good...Only  2 songs worth hearing....I grew tired of this 3 weeks after I received it. Donna Summer is one of the best....Check out her other album's/c d's......70's albums...and 1988 another place and Time....is awesome..RDC
A29GWLJ4FKJ4SX,B00EKQ3YZI,2.0,Okay I did not really pay attention to what I was buying. I was looking for a greatest hits collection of Donna Summer so I saw all the hits listed on the tracks and thus bought it. It is all remixes. Personally these songs were so good why remix them. I was very disappointed with a lot of them. They try to update the music but in my opinion they took away a lot of the soul of the music.
A2KB564KNK2Z5Z,B00EKXDVOK,5.0,"Having had the 2 original Christmas albums of hers in my collection already, I hesitated to buy this compilation at first. After having decided to buy it, I didn't expect very much from this album and never thought about playing it (but just to keep it unwrapped in my collection). ... Then, I decided to open and play it. What a surprise! The &#34;OLD&#34; and the &#34;NEW&#34; songs are put together very nicely with very nice sound-editing to the old songs. [Old Streisand songs from the 60's, 70's and 80's, in my opinion, are almost inaudible, compared to the sound quality of other artists' CDs.] Well, I have to give this CD a 5-star rating. If you are looking for a CD containing songs that are just listenable, there are many great titles by many other great artists for you to choose from. But, if you are looking for a CD with songs that are sung, interpreted and delivered in a delicately expressive way (given that you have never heard Streisand before), then this would be a very nice item for you."
AMMCC8A920RLO,B00EKXDVOK,4.0,"i have so many Christmas CDs that I didn't get a chance to listen to this CD but once during the season; I usually enjoy my CDs more after I've had the opportunity to listen to them more.

A284X80YQOKZ7J,B00ELAMR2O,5.0,"After reading the review of @ 129__BPM \"Dean Harris\" I decided to check out his complaints. Well I'm confused by some of his criticisms and some are simply wrong. He says there is nothing new offered here. Well new or rare is in the eye of the beholder. He doesn't mention that some of the 12\" versions on the 2nd disc haven't been released as \"remasters\"  or ever in some years like the long version of the Theme to the Deep or Je T'Aime (Moi Non Plus). The Theme from The Deep was originally placed on the original Live and More CD from 1990 instead of the Mac Arthur Park Suite. This sound upgrade is a great improvement over that CD from 23 years ago. And Unless you buy the newly reissued Thank God Its Friday Soundtrack (released only days ago in the U.S. by Culture Factory) Je T'Aime has not been available in a 12\" form on CD with decent sound ever.First the sound quality of the entire collection is very good. Now is it of the quality of the Donna Summer reissues from Japan last year. Not quite. But many complained they didn't want to pay 30 to 40 dollars for those discs. So this collection sounds as good as other recent reissues. As a collection that is priced reasonably I would say it is quite a deal. But opinions on sound quality differ from music that is 30 to 40 years old.Also, the booklet says that I Feel Love is Donna's 16th single and Dean says this is an error. Well it was Donna's 16th single. Below are her first 15 single releases prior to I Feel Love in 1977. Donna's first credited single came out in 1968. How could he criticize the booklet without knowing your Donna Summer history? What is the problem with Heaven Knows? It is listed on my CD back label and spelled correctly & titled correctly. Why is that a mistake? Why is it \"incorrectly mentioned?\"Also Sunset People and Our Love are offered on the bonus disc and yes they are the original album versions but they are reversed in order of the original Bad Girls Album and I don't recall Our Love or Sunset People offered taken out of the suite they came from prior to this collection. Sunset people is over 6:00 minutes long and not edited like on past collections and Our Love is over 4:30 long. About the omissions, Universal doesn't own the material he wanted included such as This Time I Know It is For Real. Donna or now Donna's estate does. So the label couldn't have included it .  Also I disagree with the comments on the booklet. The booklet is not \"sloppy.\" The artwork of the album covers is nicely done. In fact included is a rare photo of Donna and Giorgio Moroder back in the day circa mid 1970\"s. Nice touch to the booklet.

A3K3561MWRR3J,B00ELE8EW2,1.0,this cd wasnt as good as i expectedthe music was odd beatsi wish it sounded like their old cds
A2EFEVXNLGVKEM,B00ELE8EW2,4.0,"Toad has had a pretty long layoff since their last album (1997's &#34;Coil&#34;), so I didn't expect too much from this one.  But after hearing an early version of &#34;The Moment,&#34; I was reasonably sure I wanted to check this one out.  And like the 6 albums preceding it, it was a solid effort without just retreading old ground.  The airy experimentation of &#34;Rare Bird&#34; (my favorite) is reigned in by its quick speed, and the thoughtful &#34;Golden Age&#34; will appeal to fans of &#34;Windmills&#34; who wanted more.  And the studio version of &#34;The Moment&#34; is soaring and intense, with the chorus's moving bassline taking it to the next level.I have to lower it to a high four stars, though, because the whole thing has kind of an adult-contemporary vibe. The pop stuff tends to go right through me (though the title track is a pop-rock masterpiece), and I could've used a few brawnier numbers.  &#34;The Moment&#34; is probably the heaviest thing on here, and it's more of a toe-tapper tha n a full-on rocker.  &#34;Get What You Want&#34;, &#34;Is There Anyone Out There&#34;, and &#34;I'll Bet On You&#34;, while not cringeworthy, don't really do anything for me.  Even so, Glen Phillips' solo career has kept him lyrically sharp and he continues his refusal to surrender to lyrical banality, saving even the weaker material.All in all, it stands up with their strongest material.  Toad has still not released a bad album.  Hope they keep 'em coming."
A2KH3CJ11SN0VS,B00ELE8EW2,5.0,"You can tell right away this is Toad, but the songs and performances sound a bit more polished than in the past.  If you liked past Toad, you should really like this."
A1XRY1BSC9VSFV,B00ELE8EW2,4.0,"All Really Good Songs, Just Not Great Songs.  I am a Toad consumer, the kind of fan they like since I have bought everything they've ever recorded.  I like this disc, but I don't love it. I am always on the search for a &#34;forever song;&#34; something I can listen to over and over without growing tired.  For perspective my favorite Toad &#34;Forever Song&#34; is Windmills on the Dulcinea album.  Constellation will be great at a party for background music, or in the car when you don't have much else to listen to and want to daydream, but the disc, in my opinion, does not stand up to the melodic or lyrical quality of Windmills."
A2NNZQYZQB42HO,B00ELE8EW2,4.0,"Overall I really like this album. &#34;The Moment&#34; is classic Toad the Wet Sprocket. Some of the songs have lyrics that oddly reflect the age of the band (my age, sadly). I had to listen to it several times to get into it, but it's worth the download price."
A2H7ZQT695UUJM,B00ELXK8G8,5.0,This as well done of a tribute/cover album as you can find.  Noam Pikelny is as smooth a banjo player anywhere.  Get this album.
A1R2IX2BU7Y5E6,B00ELXK8G8,4.0,Good CD.
A2TTYZ3X5WOA8Y,B00EMAGCJM,2.0,"Simple fact: There are many tracks on this &#34;deluxe&#34; version of the album, and most are so mediocre--not the performance necessarily, but the writing--that you want to skip them entirely. We Can't Stop and Wrecking Ball are excellent tunes, and on both of them Ms. Cyrus--though she still has limited range and continues to sound like an electronically manipulated kazoo--displays genuine expressiveness. On some tracks Ms. Cyrus &#34;raps,&#34; though here the word &#34;rapping&#34; is inapplicable to what this young woman does--there's no flow of any kind, no unwinding of a narrative, just talking against a beat, with performers of African heritage presumably legitimating her failed efforts. There's no comparison between this album and the work of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, much less Pink, all of whom are far more rooted in the meaning and purpose of pop music. It's painful to report that an ambitious artist like Miley Cyrus is out of her depth even in the shallow waters of pop, but this is decidedly the case on the unfortunately titled Bangerz. What continues to be of interest is not the singing of Miley Cyrus but the fact that her videos require no elaborate production values; they concern themselves entirely with her face and her body, as if these are so hyper-real, so entrancing, as to require no elaboration. Something is happening here, something worth thinking about, but it has little to do with music. Miley Cyrus is her own performance."
AMP7TQRWAIE84,B00EMAGCJM,4.0,"This is not the album I prepared for. The album is A LOT more emotional than I was expecting. Yes there are some party songs here. But there are also a lot of songs that have an emotional punch to them. I guess that shouldn't be that surprising considering her ex-fiancee Liam dumped her not too long ago. I own one Miley album (2008's \"Breakout\") and let's just say this is pretty much night and day in differences. Some of the songs don't actually work too well but a lot of them do I find. Sometimes you have to expect some failings when pursuing something completely different than what you did in the past. There are some explicit lyrics here but other songs aren't. Songs that quickly stood out were \"Adore You\", \"We Can't Stop\", \"Wrecking Ball\", \"Do My Thang\" and \"Rooting For My Baby\". \"Wrecking Ball\" is an explosive pop song! It's a tragic love song. \"Do My Thang\" is my favorite song on the album; it's a very fun, rebellious track with a dark club beat (Miley raps explicitly in it). \"Wrecking Ball\" is my second favorite song and possibly the most catchy hook on the album. \"All I wanted to do was break you off/But all you did was wre-eh-eck me/You wre-eh-eck me.\"I think Miley is gonna both gain and lose fans after they hear this. It's one of those polarizing albums. I happen to like it but I know some people will hate it. It's part pop, part dance pop, there are a couple of country influences and there are some dark beats on occasion. On top of all that there are a bunch of features with mostly rappers. On a couple of tracks Miley raps herself. I do admit a lot of it is entertaining. DON'T expect most of it to be appropriate for your 10 year old though. Miley is growing up and changing and so is her music. P.S. \"4x4\" is BY FAR the worst track on the album. It just doesn't work!4 stars.DOWNLOAD:\"Do My Thang\"\"Wrecking Ball\"\"We Can't Stop\" &\"On My Own\""

A55RQ26WDPSM0,B00EMAGCJM,3.0,"This album is one of the few and far in between examples of how a cliched, overwhelming formula of broken love ties and heartbreak entangled with pop culture can actually turn out to be something good.I'm not a fan of Miley ever since her career took off with Disney, I always seemed to find her voice annoying and her music quite mainstream and average. Some of her previous work made me turn my head in repulsion. All that teenage fantasy dreams to her breakthrough albums in Can't be tamed, trying to be ab impersonation of Britney Spears and Miley and I are the same age almost and I still found that obnoxious.With this album however, despite the disturbing advertisements and publicity including the VMAs and Music Videos. I don't have a hard time accepting it like some others do. I mean yeah sure, it's shameless and embarrassing to look at the way she behaves and acts. It does make me question her sanity and she does come across as being vulgar and attention seeking at times but all that aside I think that Bangerz is an impersonation of her. No, bubble gum candy pop image is thrown at us, no overly cheesy and horrible endless Disney love songs are involved, no annoying acoustic guitars and tones. Just Miley, in all her flaws and outrageousness.The songs on here are catchy, there are nothing remarkable but they do speak out. We can't stop is obviously marked for the radio. I actually enjoyed that song, it's slow and it speaks of youthful mentality. Carefree, irresponsible and living in the moment. I refuse to look at it as anything but harmless young adults having fun. I reject the drug and alcohol abuse it may imply. Wrecking Ball the second most talked about song is a song I adore. If you switch the focus from Miley and her nude appearance the song's lyrics aren't horrible or awful. If anything they're very realistic and truthful. I'm sure most of us speaking about females primarily can relate to that song. We all have had heartbreaks and walked out of people who we cared about at some point or another. Which makes it literally wrecking. Drive is another favourite of mine, the lyrics sometimes are just too mainstream for me like how she says I will ignore when you call etc... too pop culture for my taste, but the overall message is interesting.Mindless to say, I have been going through a similar situation to what these songs were portraying when this album was released so I guess that's why I was fond of it. I'm choosing to overlook the bad image Miley has set up for herself and actually listen to what the music is about.Give it a try. Hopefully in the future her works will progress."
A3VPMEKGDLWN4I,B00EMAGCJM,5.0,"I was never a Miley Cyrus fan so I am surprised myself that I've taken time to write this review. For me her music was always too cute, too Disney and too mainstream. Unlike her peers such as Katy Perry who's goal is to make the radio industry happy with a never endless supply of happy go lucky songs, Miley finally did something that sets her apart and I like it.It's by no means a pop musical masterpiece, but it is creative, fun and catchy. I can certainly appreciate that. The first thing that I noticed was the lyrics. It's not your typical I love you, you love me la la la... Each song is unique, tells a story of deception and heartbreak but then in the next track she will be rapping about donuts and driving around on a \"4x4!\"And once you put that song on it's all over... the beat will repeat over and over in your head, Round and round and away we go. Four by four and away we go...High not low and away we go... And if you're a southern gal like myself you'll really dig it.The production is good although many of the beats are nothing new. And the only artist collaboration that stood out to me was Nelly. It made me realize how much I miss his flow.\"On My Own\" which is my favorite track on the album is only on the deluxe version but it sorta takes me back to the days of Bobby Brown and his whole rebel attitude which he brought through many of his songs like \"My Prerogative.\" I love it!All of the ballads are all really nice. \"Rooting For My Baby\" is a breezy mid tempo number with Miley singing... I know, I know, that you go through a lot, I know I know the pressure makes you hot. And then \"Someone Else\" is dramatic and pretty amazing especially the end chrous.My only disappointment is her collaboration with the beautiful Pop Princess Britney Spears. You'd think on the title track \"BANGERZ\" these two would really go back and forth and rock it out together, but I barely heard Brit on this track. Was a real let down in that regard.... but as a Miley song it was still really good. It's definitely something Britney might have released on her album \"Black Out.\"Although not as good as when Gwen Stefani's incredible creative masterpiece that was \"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\", it's still something different we rarely see from female artists these days. Well maybe except Lady GAGA, but that is it. They are either too serious or too sappy.So yeah she is pushing buttons with her attitude and her raunchy behavior but she seems to be in control despite what Sinead O'Connor says. So let's wait and see what else Miley has up her sleeve before we pass judgment on her. Preview the album and see for yourself. You just might be surprised the way I was!"

A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00EMAGIV4,3.0,"After the top ten success of \"Sweeter,\" touring with Train and Maroon 5, you could hardly blame Gavin DeGraw for wanting his albums to achieve that headliner level of success on his own. \"Make a Move\" is just that kind of album, tasting of the generic pop Maroon 5 turns out on a regular basis, but minus the charisma of an Adam Levine, and pumped up production-wise until it falls victim to the loudness wars. Even with a decent stereo system, \"Best I Ever Had\" splats its way through its over-compression. If that's not enough, the songs here are all co-helmed by hired guns like Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, which robs the songs of personality but makes them sound exquisitely tailored for pop radio, like the way \"Heartbreak\" so effortlessly clones Maroon 5.That's a darn shame, as the best moments of \"Sweeter\" and earlier albums showed a promising keyboardist writing and performing some nicely personal work and showing some semblance of personality, ala Five For Fighting's John Ondrasik. As over-done as \"Best I Ever Had\" is, it's still a darn fine poptune. Same for the mellower \"Everything Will Change,\" co-written with Boys Like Girls' Martin Johnson (who made their pop move on their last album, \"Crazy World\"), but it still feels like the most personal song on \"Make a Move.\" In total, there aren't any real bad songs here, only indistinguishable ones. That isn't always a hindrance, so if the album wasn't so darn over-produced, I might have bumped it to a fourth star. Between the over-cooked sound and what sounds like a general removal of Gavin's personality, \"Make a Move\" comes off as generic. He's done better."

A1M2R94KWXQAMT,B00EMGUR60,5.0,"This album is as good as ANYTHING Mot&ouml;rhead has EVER done in the last... 40 YEARS!?!?! In fact, the sounds on this record almost purposely reflect it. No offense to the band, but the last couple records had sort of a stale guitar tone, not here, VERY organic compared to the last couple records, I am FEELING this one, BIG TIME!!! Mot&ouml;rhead RULES!!! Lemmy, Phil and Mikkey... Thank you, you guys ALWAYS bring the SHAKE!!! \\m/"
ACCZJHQKB7S9A,B00EMIE0CA,4.0,"This is a well played album but it is not Sprya Gyra at its best.  I have listen to and collected this groups music for years.  First time liteners will like it, but old heads like me know that Sprya Gyra can do this and more."
A2TUUQUQQY0JZ,B00EMIE0CA,5.0,The Rhinebeck Sessions is a another great CD from a class band Great sound Good Beat tight sound as usual
A3E60VB20UMPJ7,B00EMLKW8S,5.0,"One of my favorite Avett Brothers albums, seems to flow right along with all the others. Great for kicking back and relaxing!"
A2H94FN8TELGQY,B00EMZYBPY,5.0,I'm a long time fan of Toby Keith's music.  He gets to me time and again with real views of our real life lived by real people.
A32STUKZBLX1FJ,B00ENM1W8K,3.0,"To begin, I've been listening to Michael Schenker since I was in 8th grade; I'm now 47. He's the reason I play guitar; why I own a white Gibson V; why my 8 year old son knows the lyrics to Doctor Doctor....and so on.I really enjoy the songs on this album, especially Doogie's voice, but the main reason why anyone buys a Michael Schenker recording is because of Michael Schenker. Unfortunately, his solos are the weakest part of this album! His rhythm guitar parts are very well done and have a compressed and aggressive feel to them; maybe the best rhythm work he's done since  the Assault Attack album. All that is well and good; however, the solos are quite lackluster.The reason Michael Schenker became my favorite guitarist was because his solos spoke volumes. They were like small symphonies in their own right; technically brilliant, innovative and soulful. To this day, many of his solos give me goose bumps. I actually got a speeding ticket once because I was so into a Schenker solo that I forgot to watch what I was doing on the road! I am severely disappointed at the lack of zest and emotion in the solos on this album. Maybe it's the Dean Flying V, maybe it's just Michael's changing mood as a musician. I can't put my finger on it but it's disappointing. There is no attack on the guitar. Virtually every phrase of every solo is played in either the split pickup position or the neck position and, frankly, the solos are boring. Though they are still technically fluid, they truly are missing that traditional Schenker spark.Thus, if you are a fan of Michael's music primarily because of his solos....I would not recommend this album. Props to the other musicians; they all sound great. I hope Michael returns to the sounds that made him a legend."
A1F81X2S8I1ZET,B00ENMJCHS,4.0,Cassadee is the winner of the third edition of The Voice. She is truly a wonderful and talented singer and a friendly person.Her debut album is solid and it's country-pop and country-rock oriented. It has many potential hits and the lead single &#34;Wasting All These Tears&#34; is one of the best country songs of the year. It was a hit and personally it made me interested in Cassadee's album and i'm glad i checked it out because i truly enjoyed it. I won't give it 5/5 because there are two-three fillers but in general most of the album tracks are decent and well-produced.My favourite tracks:&#34;Wasting All These Tears&#34;&#34;Easier to Lie&#34;&#34;I Wish I Could Break Your Heart&#34; (recently performed on The voice)&#34;11&#34;&#34;Proved You Wrong&#34;
A2KGDAC6NF7NVY,B00ENMJCHS,5.0,"Great cd this being her first as good as it is, The voice was right  on this being the winner,Kudos to The voice for getting her to the end  &#34; Thanks Blake&#34;"
A3IFYLQKASM5DE,B00ENMJCHS,3.0,"I really like Cassidy on 'The Voice'.  I think she is very talented. I had hoped for a better first CD coming off her win.  I really like about half the songs on this 11 Song CD.  The other songs are okay, but I usually just skip through.  I give it four stars and the songs I like are really good.  I know that with most CD's in the market, it's rare to like every song.  However, half is not the best way to get started."
A12P9KAAW8D9XW,B00ENMZW04,5.0,"Lisa Stansfield works with original material, and as great as she is has suffered from some bad material(her sophomore album comes to mind). So it was worth waiting for a new album of original material from one of the masters of  British &#34;blue eyed soul&#34;. Two stand outs on this import album are  &#34;Can't Dance&#34; and  &#34;Love Can&#34;. The CD with bonus material has a great new mix of &#34;You Can't Deny it&#34; and some great live tracks."
A29RF2Z8YYSVZ0,B00ENMZW04,5.0,"After taking a different direction with her 2004 disc &#34;The Moment&#34;, it's almost as if Lisa had disappeared off of the face of the earth.  &#34;The Moment&#34; found her diverting from Soul/R&B; into a more Pop direction.  The album floundered and was forgotten rather quickly.  So, after an almost 10 year hiatus, Lisa is back with her seventh album simply entitled &#34;Seven&#34; and it is, quite easily, one of her best!&#34;Seven&#34; finds Lisa thankfully going back to her R&B; roots.  Unlike many other veteran artists, Lisa does not make the mistake of trying to sound &#34;relevant&#34; or contemporary, by depending on computerized drum machines and Pop/Techno beats (she's using REAL instruments!!!).  And she does not fall into the trap that many of her contemporaries have by recording an album full of covers. No, Lisa sticks with original material and the sound that made her an international star in the first place, retro-soul.  She pays homage to the R&B; of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s without sounding outdated.  Her voice shines on each and every song.  There is something for everyone here, dance songs, mid-tempo jams and smoldering ballads.  It's hard to really choose my favorite songs because all of them are pretty darn fantastic!The only gripe I have is the fact that the CD only has 10 original tracks.  There are some bonus tracks.  One is a remake of her 1990 #1 R&B; smash, &#34;You Can't Deny It&#34;.  Usually when artists remake their own songs, they come off sounding desparate and hokey. But, this one actually works.  She takes the song in a totally different direction without making it unrecognizable.  I was expecting not to like it but it's pretty amazing!  The rest of the bonus tracks consists of a handful of live in concert performances, most notably &#34;Time To Make You Mine&#34;, &#34;Set Your Loving Free&#34;, as well as &#34;Someday (I'm Coming Back)&#34;.  While these are some very fine performances, I was hoping for some more new material.Overall, this is my favorite CD of 2014 thus far.  Lisa, we missed you and thank you for bringing REAL R&B; back with you!"
A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00ENSH99K,5.0,"I have to admit I'm new to the party, having discovered The Devil Makes Three with this release.  I am a big fan of Buddy Miller, so when I saw that he produced this record I was very excited to hear it and I am not disappointed.It is hard to put The Devil Makes Three into any one musical genre.  It's a bit blues, a bit old school country, some ragtime with some rockabilly and folk thrown in for good measure.  The band brings an unmistakable energy to each and every song here on &#34;I'm A Stranger Here.&#34;This is an album of well played acoustic music from a three piece band that sounds a whole lot bigger at times.  The band does not have a drummer, but instead they bring the rhythm with the guitar and big bass lines.While it may seem like a contradiction most of the songs on this album sound both new and fresh and also like they could have been recorded 50 or 60 years ago.  It is probably due to the fact that the band pretty much live-tracked the album, playing the songs together in one room to get that live show energy.  Which, of course is exactly guys like Elvis and Johnny Cash recorded their stuff at the legendary Sun Records Studios.The bottom line here is great songs, amazing musicianship and an album that should be heard by anyone no matter what musical genre is your favorite."
A13RTYCJGTXUBS,B00ENSHA62,5.0,"I think this is the best CHristmas Album I have found in a while. The original songs are excellent and the classics are not overdone, beautiful!"
A33LKRMLTQUWQA,B00ENSHA62,5.0,"Kelly does it again and she never disappoints!! A must have for all Kelly Clarkson fans even if you are not really a Christmas album fan. This is filled with modern contemporary Christmas songs and not classic Christmas carols other than Silent Night. Songs go from the rockin' &#34;Run, Run Rudolph&#34; to the melodious and only classic carol &#34;Silent Night&#34; done as a trio with Reba and Trisha Yearwood.Truly a Kelly treat for both fans and non-fans(Is there such a thing as a non-Kelly fan?) alike."
A344M4952B9D8Y,B00ENSHA62,5.0,I played this over and over again.  This is the best of her singing to date i think. This album will be a classic.
A2IO2RBJOQ7FEJ,B00ENSHA62,3.0,"I agree with the other reviewer that said it seems like Kelly and her producers couldn't figure out what type of Christmas album to make.  Some parts traditional, country and mostly contemporary but nothing that really stands out as spectacular. I love Kelly's voice and think she is a phenomenal singer, but this Christmas album will probably not get heavy rotation on my holiday playlist.  The production is jarring at times and the project as a whole is lacking that Christmas feel that I expected/wanted. I know the idea is to showcase her voice, but I feel like the vocal is too up front in most of the mixes and therefore loses that warm Christmas album sound. So for me it's a disappointing release. My first impression was that it was kind of average and boring. I know she can do better..."
A2B267ZWGY8U5Q,B00ENSHA62,5.0,Love Kelley Clarkson she is a great singer and I love the songs on this cd they are great  underneath the tree and run run Rudolph I love those songs
A6F0C0UJBNHMA,B00ENSHA62,5.0,"Kelly sounds awesome, the music sounds awesome, the songs are awesome. This is an awesome CD! I could not stop listening to it once I put it in. It's so worth the money!!"
A2D6UKICJU4V0X,B00ENSHA62,5.0,It is great to have a new Xmas song that I really like - Wrapped in Red.  Her voice is great and I like her interpretations of the classic songs.
AMLPGY4JHHMKG,B00EO4SBSG,5.0,"I have been a Trivium fan since ascendancy and a dedicated fan since shogun. VF is a great collection of what they have done and where they are going with future albums. The production value is top notch. Mathews vocals are stronger than ever, the music is more aggressive than their previous effort (in waves....I absolutely love in waves), another bass solo from Paolo. I dont think it's fair to pick any favorites,  but I will name 3...at the end of this war, through blood and dirt and bone and finally villainy thrives. These three songs have creative vocal patterns and awesome lyrics (villainy thrives).For some, this record might need to grow on you. At least give it a chance!"
AKHDCY31VYD95,B00EO4SBSG,5.0,"Good album,like this album when Im having a couple of beers etc.old slang mary jane,etc,etc,etc.Come on out there,buy this album.Im old,but metal music is good for your brains.attention head bangers,kock,kock,kock."
A2VSZ0SUWYTFYG,B00EON8TJ8,5.0,Maybe my favorite R&B type songs come from this dude who is funny and can rap with the best of them....don't shoe horn him as a anything he is a Musician and songwriter with a Minor in Comedy...Jean Grae/Devin/PlayBoyTre are the 3 funniest folks in music. Enjoy
A3N41XDZESBZW5,B00EOZ9B3Y,5.0,"It a shame that it seem that his passing has created the set. But this set is a fine way to fine a quality artist and his work, The set is broken down two albums per CD and the Third CD is bonus tracks (live, demos, & extra songs).  There is a career overview by Mark Robinson that helps you see Gold as the Studio Musician, and what that's like at the time. All the albums have all the recording information nicely presented over a couple of pages per album.  The albums are not audiophile quality, but a very solid sounding transfer, very enjoyable.  If you want any of Andrew Gold's album, I think you should get them all  in the beautful package."
A1DSES64WY3DGM,B00EP22P7A,2.0,"Gone is the punk attitude, gone is the great swinging drums. This album is more blues-rock based with a little country influence.  Really not my thing compared to past works, but \"She's Not Gone Yet, But She's Leaving\" is a very good song"
A30Q6FYEC4QXKY,B00EP22QKG,2.0,"I love Joan Jett. I saw her a decade ago and she still rocked it. However, let's be honest... she's no great songwriter. All her biggest hits were either written by other people (I Love Rock N Roll, Do Ya Wanna Touch, Everyday People, Light of Day, Crimson & Clover) or co-written by other people (Desmond Child, Paul Westerberg, Kathleen Hannah, Jim Vallance, etc).Hence, almost all of her albums are really hit or miss. And this is no different. There's a few decent tracks, no real knockouts, and some absolute duds. There's nothing on here that will be on a greatest hits package in 10 years. Still a great live show, still a great rock n roll persona, still lacking songwriting chops."
A2XE7SG4ZFAOIB,B00EP22QKG,5.0,"This new Cd of hers is so so so great, Unvarnished is a brand new selection of tunes, that you will LOVE to have by Miss Jett!!!, so glad she has started making music again!!!!."
A3ASLR06ZGPAA1,B00EP22QKG,5.0,Again she's the best...I have all her albums now working on all cds a must. If u love rock n roll u will love Joan jett
A1NY71DI2EIUTP,B00EP22QKG,4.0,"I've only listened to it one time but it was solid from top to bottom, maybe the last song is a bit slow for me, but overall this is a rocker and I really like it."
ANIZFFDDR7247,B00EP22QKG,4.0,"It's Joan Jett music. The only thing preventing me from making this a 5 star review is the immediate lack of an instant anthem like \"Hate Myself\" or \"Touch Me\" or \"Bad Reputation\"  I hope time proves me wrong.  Saw Joan and Blackhearts live this past Saturday.  The band played 7 songs from the new album and they all held up great on stage.  Thanks Joan Jett for doing it your way."
AFNQ5M190VC28,B00EP3UESQ,5.0,"This album is a \"must have\" as far as I'm concerned if you are a true Don Williams fan. I agree with another reviewer that all of these songs are like a  \"Greatest Hits\"  in their own right that never got radio play.  Well, some of them did, but there are definitely some that did not that SHOULD have.  Even though I already have the radio hits that are found here,  I will still purchase this collection for one song that has eluded me all these years....\"Help Yourselves to Each Other\".  I think this is one of Don's finest songs ( both musically and lyrically) that he ever did.  Another song found here that I really love is \"Reason to Be\".  I find all of Don's songs so soothing and relaxing,but especially these two just put my mind, heart and soul so at ease.  Anytime I'm feeling stressed out I just think about these (and so many other Don Williams songs )and pull them up from the \"jukebox in my mind\"  and immediately feel calm and at peace.  Thank you Don Williams for giving us so much great music to listen to."
A3I7E56RSWYCXL,B00EP6JA7E,5.0,ITS GREAT HEARING COVERS OF SONGS AND HALESTORM IS GREAT.  I LOVE THIS CD AND IT GET PLAYED ALL THE TIME.
AMMU5CH3AIWCJ,B00EP6JA7E,4.0,"I really enjoyed 1.0 but 2.0 felt kinda flat to me in comparison. I will say it could be that I preferred the song choices on the first one more but the recordings themselves didn't seem as energized to me. I totally love Halestorm so it will be in rotation, don't doubt that! I am totally ready for a new original album from them!!"
ADXO5GSX05ZBC,B00EPFCDAG,3.0,"It's okay, not great, not terrible. Maybe I expected too much from R. Kelly, but as a fan, I thought it would be better"
A2B8YOF6EN4VB7,B00EPFCDAG,4.0,"Even though the cd is not really an absolute classic like his first 6 solo albums from 1992 to 2005 but it's certainly there are some cool songs on the cd as well as the wild, sensual & freaky songs that's on the cd."
A2VNIZTV0BGUCX,B00EPFCDAG,5.0,I mean you just can not go wrong with any R. Kelly CD. I love it and it will be timeless.
A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00EPFCDAG,3.0,"The most glaring flaw, apparent just by browsing the setlist, is a Prelude randomly placed at track 4. Even a song with that title would throw things off a bit, but it's not a song. It's an actual three-minute prelude, not to the album but to the track that follows, which is a song, entitled Marry The P*ssy. If it, a silly skit in which R Kelly plays himself and two other characters engaged in ghetto-comical dialogue, had to be included at all, it should've come at the beginning of the album. As is, all it does is interrupt the flow.Not that the songs themselves are particularly enticing. Black Panties is his second best album title after 12 Play; most of the others, not the albums but their titles, are rather atrocious; but, while I'm glad he's returned to the role of raunchy sex maniac after going retro romantic for the last two, it continues the run of mediocrity that began with TP3. His releases were consistently pleasing until then; especially the R one, which could easily have been a classic if it were condensed down to, say, the best twelve songs.This one has twelve songs on it, plus the aforementioned Prelude, but none of them really come close to matching the quality of his best work. Legs Shake, which borrows the style of its repeated \"love\" line from Michael Jackson's Lady In My Life, is an early highlight. It's also one of three songs about licking p*ssy, which R Kelly does both literally and figuratively. But his juvenile lyrics, his obvious reliance on an Auto-Tune-like vocal processor, and rap features from the likes of Jeezy and 2 Chainz leave much to be desired.marcellee.com"
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00EPFCDAG,4.0,"no matter where  you come down on R.Kelly one thing you can't say is that he won't try it all.  the man musically is so versatile and so creative that any and everything goes into his music making science.  this  album is said by him to be a up dated 12 play or tp2,however  while content is strong, that stand out track what i call the money track isn't their. however a strong connection of songs and a groove which would break Miley Cyrus's back from twearking to this  album are present.  the first song &#34;Legs shaking&#34; Featuring Ludacris who has worked with R for years. that song has a tribute groove to Michael  Jackson's &#34;the Lady in My Life&#34; which will work on a pole.  Genius  is a  cut which channels Rick James &#34;Dream Maker: and Prince;s the Beautiful ones and yet it has a R.kelly tone and feel  all its own.  just like  &#34;Cookie&#34; which could have been done by  Bonecrusher with that 808  crash  he makes it work and  any song which talks about  Oreo Cookies is gonna make you hungry and dip the milk.Marry the P  is the cut that is a romantic anthem which you should get married to period. that is a anthem right there. i mean its a true story song and you need to put a ring there and seal that deal like a  glad bag.however a cut like &#34;Shut up&#34; is epic because the haters thought he was down with his surgery and he came back. this is Classic Rachet, my story with him and  2 chainz works and i like him and young jeezy together,  the only real knocks is the use of autotone because this Man has the best Instrument in modern Pop Music. i mean his voice is timeless. and also  he doesn't have that  classic Kells song, however this album flows nicely.  however he doesn't have to listen to Trey Songz, the future, the Dream,etc.. because those  guys combined don't have one memorable song seeing him at his best. however he is competitive and this album flows all over the place and back.  this album has a cool little duet with Kelly Rowland and i still feel that is another subtraction because  R.kelly hasn't had that side voice to compliment him since he worked with Kelly Prince, though since tp3 with Nivea, to double up with Keysha Cole, to untitlted with Kerri Hilson,K Mechelle on love letter.  however this album is cool and it works for what he is aiming for and he is the only artist that to me keeps you wondering what is he going to do next and what is the next chapter of his musical story.  he got the humor, the frankness and his vibe of the past, present and what is happening.  you can always count on him putting an album out and having folks talking.  he is the most polarizing figure in Music and he wouldn't have it any other way."
A2KIJ14WL68PJJ,B00EPFCDAG,1.0,"Why? R.Kelly?? WHY? His last two albums were classics so I was expecting a whole lot from mr.Kelly. Those albums gave me hope that R.Kelly grew up, like most of his early day fans, but how wrong I was!! Nothing sexy about a 47 y.o. man whose lyrics are so immature they have to contain p***y and n***a in every song. Don't even compare it to Twelve Play, it is nowhere near that superb quality!!! If you are like me and enjoy your music to be mature, grown and sexy... stay away from this trainwreck, because this music is immature, childish and raunchy!!! What a dissapointment!!!TOO BAD THERE ARE A LOT OF FAKE REVIEWS on this cd now (how coincedental there are a lot of \"first time\" reviewers who give this cd 5 stars!!) otherwise it would have been a bonafide 2 star album..don't believe all that, take a good listen for yourself before you buy this crap"
A2HT6Z8PP1RTJ6,B00EPFCDAG,3.0,"R. Kelly the self-acclaimed \"King of R&B;\" has released his 15th project \"Black Panties\"My only favorite song off of \"Black Panties\" is \"All The Way\" f/ Kelly Rowland the rest of the songs are okay but due to the graphic language and content it's really hard for me to get into the whole project although I'm very aware that he does have an edited version but that's all besides the point.Now before any of you R. Kelly fans start saying that I'm a HATER and I don't know what I'm talking about just hear me out. I understand that to many R. Kelly is a musical genius I personally think that he's indeed a LYRICAL genius for there's no topic that R. Kelly can't write a song about but it also becomes a time when you get a certain age as a musician/songwriter that you must show signs of growth and maturity. Yes, R. Kelly did release 2 albums before that was aimed towards a more grown and sexy audience (\"Love Letter & Write Me Back\") with lack luster results but as I said in my reviews on those projects It sounded too much as a gimmick of him imitating other artists instead of being HIMSELF therefore people didn't support it only \"Love Letter\" barely made it to \"Gold\" status according to the RIAA.R. Kelly feels it's time to appease the younger audiences by making songs like \"Legs Shaking\", \"Cookie\", \"Throw This Money On You\", \"Marry the P###y\", \"Crazy Sex\" \"Tear It Up\", \"Show Ya P###y\", etc. I remind you this is coming from a man who is presently 46 yrs old with 3 children. I swear sometimes R.Kelly is suffering from an identity crisis cause one moment he's an R&B; singer, the next moment he's an hood rapper & the next moment he's an wannabe character of other artists.Damn...Will the \"REAL\" R. Kelly please stand up!Sure \"Black Panties\" is a 5 star album if you support HOOD-ism, RATCHET-ism, STRIPPER-POLE-ism, GHETTO-ism, & PORNO-ism. I'm sure there are many people who really love this project but why are mainly African-Americans are so prone to entertain this kind of foolishness and dare to call it \"Grown and Sexy\" no I call it straight \"Trashy, Tasteless & Unclassy\" and expected R. Kelly especially at his age to have more class and higher standards than to stoop so low just to sell records.R. Kelly is such a talented individual and to be labeled as \"The KING of R&B;\" with all of the accomplishments and accolades he has achieved over his 20 year span in the music industry it's really disappointing to hear him come out with a project like this being so \"OVER THE TOP\" but given the fact due to his past (marrying a 15 yr old Aaliyah, sex tape allegation with an underage girl but of course acquitted in the court of law) maybe this shouldn't come as no surprise based on his character but until he can actually find himself R. Kelly will forever be a double minded and confused person so I will kindly take his advice off one of his songs on this project and \"SHUT UP\" but before I do I will end it by saying to R. Kelly \"GROW the \"F###\" UP!\" Since that seems to be the only word you can relate to...but until then The \"KING of R&B;\" in my book is \"JOE\"."
A1R8WFH8USY6Y6,B00EPFEY44,5.0,Love this CD
A2TCBDO1NU4G2G,B00EPFEY44,2.0,"Bocelli is great, and the Portofino concert, as seen on PBS, was fantastic.  Which makes this offering so disappointing...the DVD does not include all the songs as seen in the original showing. Why?"
A1V63LD616VAO3,B00EPFEY44,5.0,"The very best voice. I purchased it because I have seen the concert in live. It is superb to have both the CD and DVD. High quality of both discs, excellent delivery, and very fast shipment. I have them all. Strongly recommend this company."
A2PWUBVLTG22DD,B00EPFEY44,5.0,I have almost every andrea bocelli cd to date and this just came out and i'm thinking to myself do i really need another one ? So i bought it and honestly its just as good as always his last cd and this one have alot of new material which i appreciate after alot pf semi redundant cd's with to many songs that were the same with different arrangements or duet partners.
AZJS53GKC9YWC,B00EPLVZ2C,4.0,"I have the original vinyl album so it was nice to see that an SACD version was now available.  There are two hits off this album are &#34;A Horse With No Name&#34; and &#34;I Need You.&#34;  This a clean recording that effectively reproduces the sound quality of the original vinyl album.  My primary beef with the SACD has to do more with the SACD format in general. It is an effective format for higher end audio than a stereo only copy.Paying more for quality sound is fine, but for the price I think a 5.1 surround version would warrant the 5 stars for my review."
A14DG37EGNCSRQ,B00EPO13AS,2.0,This Was  Stand Up  Aqualung  All great albums  This one is a let down.  I really like Jethro Tull early stuff except for this one.  I really tried to like it.  Its kind of a downer
A20DMEJVK1RPVF,B00EQ30RVY,5.0,"Very good initial product involving Chester from Linkin Park, formerly. He uses his voice more to fit-in to STP sound than contrast like he used his voice for LP to stick-out and overwhelm there sound. Good ole' STP"
AN8WCREEAS932,B00EQ30RVY,3.0,"Music is subjective since each listener likes or dislikes a particular song for specific reasons.  This is Stone Temple Pilots, no doubt, and a couple of the songs on this EP are quite enjoyable, reminding me of an old STP back to Purple or Tiny Music.  Chester Bennington took a bit of getting used to on vocals but on the track Out of Time specifically, he really works.  The other songs I'm not in love with but it's a decent effort from a band that, in my opinion, tends to polarize their audience every time they have a release.  The old days of Dark Crunchy STP to some of the more recent Happy Melodic STP iterations make my head spin.  Even though that is true, this is a good STP release and if anything it has sparked my interest to hear more from STP with Chester.  Final verdict: give it a try, new STP is good STP!"
A262O8WGF760GY,B00ER0QFW6,5.0,I love Nelly's music he is a wonderful performer.  His music is always great to listen to.  I enjoyed this cd a lot.

Now without financial cares for a while, thanks to his recent MacArthur \"genius\" grant, Jeremy has finally given us his Goldbergs. And a rare treat they are! I can add little to the other reviews here, except to say that for me these join Glenn Gould's overwhelming (if sometimes irritating) efforts at the very top of the heap -- even though they seem in some ways Gould's exact opposites. A joy to listen to. Mesmerizing.The mundane stuff: All repeats are taken. The recorded sound is excellent and the ornamentations well-done. The packaging is cheap cardboard but well-enough designed. No booklets or printed program notes. But the accompanying one-hour DVD, with Jeremy walking us though the piece in some detail, is worth the price of admission by itself, as reviewer WH says.Five or more stars. Enjoy!"
A3PKSCR738T4BT,B00ER23UTU,5.0,Beautiful arrangements and lyrics that may seem simple but grab you and move you the more you listen to this album. I can't say enough about this album only that if you like his music you will definitely love this album. It's good to know that there's still good Mexican singers making good music!!!
A2ECYCMXNSYOPX,B00ER23V1W,4.0,"it is a good sound track, and Mr. Price did an excellent job of helping the film along without getting in the way of the story"
A1QQ93ZMRSXKC3,B00ER23V1W,5.0,"I loved the movie and simply adored the score, I couldn't wait to order it from Amazon after I'd seen the show&#8230; I haven't stopped playing it since it arrived, it makes great driving music.  Pop the disc in and you're right back in the movie with Sandra Bullock in non-stop peril.  Couldn't be better.  Very Vangelis-esq, not so much the Zimmerman-styled riffs we've been over-saturated with of late, a refreshing take, I look forward to more from Mr. Price."
ARE2MDLUM3APW,B00ERH12IQ,5.0,This cd was awesome I love Najee I think he's one of the best Jazz artist out there and I try to buy all of his stuff.
A3GJX16R2L6E97,B00ERH12IQ,5.0,Najee never disappoints.No wonder he&#34;s been in the game so long.he&#34;s wonderful.Always good music..It amazes me how he keeps it so fresh.
A1X9E3YRTX3UNU,B00ERH12K4,4.0,"This is a great addition for any Christmas CD collection, Alabama always delivers great music, I  really liked Christmas in Dixie,Christmas Blessings and my favorite  Angles Among Us"
A3SOKU9YSVYRVM,B00ERH12K4,5.0,I have always loved this type of music. It is a simple but wholesome with good harmony. You can tell that this group has a special sound and tallent.
A26V5VUOU9A8U2,B00ERH14WU,4.0,"This is my go-to Christmas music, wonderful stuff that I will be playing for maybe a week before to help get into the mood more.  Wonderful production  of classic style."
AEYFNY8MVXBFS,B00ERH14WU,5.0,"Another great hit by this music team.  Listened to it over and over again, what can I say just great music."
ABUQE1M1IIW8F,B00ERH154M,5.0,As always they are one of the best Christian Rock groups.  Was hoping the version of &#34;I can only imagine&#34; was the original but still great.
A2HJDG96MY7HJ1,B00ERH15DI,5.0,What is there to say about Pavarotti that hasn't already been said?  He is a master.  He is the best.  He is far above any other opera singer and this album is his best.  I heard it on PBS and just had to have it.  What a talent.
A2LK9M2GGM0CP3,B00ERH15L0,5.0,I love listening to Christmas music and I like Martina McBride.  This is a very good album and I would highly recommend it.
A2HG6LY4W25T6Z,B00ERXKWYK,3.0,"I am a Fan of this band.  I have really enjoyed their albums, and their take it or leave it attitude. They are amazing live! That being said, this 2nd half of the release doesn't have the same impact as the first half.  Almost comes across like some old B side compilations. Not bad, just not as good as...well.....honestly....anything else they have released. I would say that the House of the Rising sun is a very good cover, but for that buy the single, not the album."
AFOG9VRWEN13V,B00ERXKWYK,5.0,HAVE ALL 5FDP CD'S EVEN THE IMPORT CD'S--THIS VOL 2 IS KILLER AS VOL 1---THIS BAND IS SO AWSOME GET ALL THEIR CD'S !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A326JKMH8Q3ULA,B00ERXKWYK,4.0,"The Wrong Side of Heaven & the Righteous Side Of Hell, Vol 1, although related, is not needed to enjoy volume 2. Volume 2 is amazing on its own. If you like FFDP, then this album is essential for your collection."
A14WOJPANG8HUP,B00ERXKWYK,5.0,"Volume 2 is here and was very much worth the wait (even though it was only a few months). It's musical sound fits very well with volume 1 but has it's own style to stand on it's own. This time around there are no collaborations or duets (not that there was anything wrong with them, I enjoyed them) and I was happy with that (the more of Ivan's voice heard, the better IMO). What I was kinda surprised about was that there really wasn't any kind of referencing to volume 1. I would have really liked to have a split story kind of deal, maybe with volume 1 being more the wrong side of heaven and volume 2 the righteous side of hell,,, something like that if it makes sense. But it's nothing to complain about, the album is excellent and will not disappoint. To me the band keeps getting better as time passes.  As for the songs themselves.... I'll start with the exciting surprises. Cold and The House of the Rising Sun. Cold is a remake from Ivan's past with Black Blood Orchestra. I had only discovered BBO by accident awhile ago and I think it's great for Ivan to bring his past work into the present. The song is awesome and haunting all at once. And House of the Rising Sun, I have to say I love this unexpected cover. So many artists have covered this folk song, and I have liked past versions, but to hear Ivan sing it makes me feel the song was meant to be sung by him. I hope to hear more songs like this on their future albums.I'm not going to do a song by song breakdown for this album as I do not feel there is a need. There is not a single song to skip on this album and no filler. The Agony of Regret is the one instrumental song on the album, but it's just over a minute and a half, so if you aren't the biggest instrumental fan out there, you'll still be good(I'm not much of one and I was fine). The rest of the songs are exactly what you expect from the band and all 5 of them work together to make some killer sounds.My personal favorites this time around are: Here to Die, Wrecking Ball, Cradle to the Grave and A Day in My Life. I love all the songs on here but these are the 4 I truly enjoy because they are the ones that make me feel as if Ivan is pulling excerpts from my own life. That's another reason I love this band, besides the awesome music, I really feel like they relate to the average guy (or at least do a very good job of trying to).Anyway once again I highly recommend this album to all fans and potential new fans of the band. If this is your starting point, make sure to do yourself a favor and experience the rest of their stuff. (also if you like Ivan's voice and his style be sure to check out his other works like Ghost Machine, Motograter, Black Blood Orchestra....) If you are already a Knucklehead, then get this now if you haven't already and immerse yourself in it. That's what I've been doing these last couple days and what I will be doing for an indefinite amount of days to come. GOOD STUFF!!!!!"
A1VPMHKWJICPHI,B00ERXKXSA,5.0,"Her voice still is strong and came back stronger than ever!!! After listening to it I felt well fed, but it could have gone on forever as far as I'm concerned!!!"
A2NEMGBFLAFR7I,B00ERXKXSA,5.0,I love Lita Ford's music and I have just about everything that she has released. Great music ad she still is going strong and is a great performer. She always delivers a great listening experience.
A2RUD912SMAR8S,B00ET3BDAU,5.0,"An interesting thing about Vertical Horizon is their musical evolution over time. No two albums of theirs sound the same; and Echoes From The Underground further emphasizes this. It's a great effort from the band that brought the ever-familiar &#34;Everything You Want&#34; and it gives us so much more. If you're new to Vertical Horizon, I'd say you should definitely give them a look; you can sample each of their albums and hear for yourself the incredible difference this band has made over time. You'll hear a great diversity of sounds they have undergone; and you're bound to find something to enjoy if you have an ear for rock music. Even though the sound differs greatly from their past efforts, Vertical Horizon fans should have no trouble accessing this album.If you're looking for stand-out tracks you have the opening &#34;You Never Let Me Down&#34; a great alternative rocker that works to excite and draw the listener on their first-listening experience of the album. &#34;Broken Over You&#34; has a great personality, it works as an easy-listening rocker and is a clear choice for hand-picking favorites. One of my favorite moments on &#34;Song for Someone&#34; other than the catchy chorus is a good stretch of instrumental work at the end of the song. &#34;Instamatic&#34; is a fan favorite; it features Neil Peart of Rush fame and shows beautifully on this track. The captivating &#34;I Free You&#34; track was a moving experience for me; one that made me feel in touch with the voice held within.There is much to be said of each track from the album; I've heard it at least 5 times by now and I feel that each person has their taste for different sounds. It's hard to put to words the feelings that went into this album so I suggest listening for yourself and giving it a well-earned chance."
A10TQ9GWO5H2MP,B00ET3BDAU,5.0,"I was part of Vertical Horizon's Pledge Music drive. I was looking forward to a new album for a long time. Well worth the wait.&#34;Instamatic&#34; is my favorite track. &#34;Half-Light&#34; is awesome. I have my 13 year old daughter rocking along with me to &#34;Echoes&#34;.New to VH or a seasoned listener, Echoes from the Underground is top shelf."
A3NADP9LFVC6YJ,B00ETIT5GO,5.0,"This cd is great. I love the lyrics, he sounds fantastic. I highly recommend this cd for anyone who liked Mountain."
A1EWKU4ZEQLW0X,B00ETIT5GO,5.0,"I have been a fan of Leslie West since he popped up on the music scene with Mountain. In my opinion this is probably the best thing he has done since his early days. The album starts of with a blistering &#34;Dying Since the Day I Was Born&#34; followed by the bluesy &#34;Busted, Disgusted or Dead&#34;. &#34;Not Over You&#34; & &#34;Feelin' Good&#34; are also killer songs. Can't recommend this too much for any lover of hard rocking blues. Also give this album an A+."
A2RQ7QBG305XYP,B00ETIT5GO,5.0,"I am so happy Leslie West is still with us an playing his ass off all over the place with some nice guests adding to the festivities. This album was well worth the wait for me and has some monster playing by everybody on here. I particularly enjoyed &#34;When A Man Loves A Women&#34; with Leslie and Jonny Lang together. Get it, it's finger lickin' good.Monk"
A3GKOOYNYL72P3,B00ETIT5GO,5.0,"This is an &#34;I'm not dead yet&#34;, full of life,and the joy of life.West at his hollerin' best, that classic guitar tone.I like every song.Mostly it is ball-breaking hard solid bluesy American Rock...what you would expect, only better, but leavened with some periods of true beauty, in the rock idiom....again, unsurprising looking back even to his early works.I prefer this set to &#34;Unusual Suspects&#34;, which is spoiled, though not very, by a few small dull patches.If a listener doesn't get this, perhaps they have no soul."
A2O57LB3BP3WTS,B00EUGYM04,5.0,"If you are a die-hard fan of SEETHER, than this album is a perfect fit to your collection. Not only are there SEETHER classics such as FINE AGAIN, THE GIFT, REMEDY, FAKE IT, and COUNTRY SONG, but there are also rare tracks that could mostly be found on Japanese imports or on Marvel movie soundtracks, as well as three new songs. Out of the new tracks, my favorite has to be SAFE TO SAY I'VE HAD ENOUGH, but I do think it's very clever that the band decided to cover a song that's named after them, originally done by VERUCA SALT. My only problem with this album is that OUT OF MY WAY and HANG ON can be found on the DISCLAIMER II album that was released back in 2004, and that album can be found at many stores, so these tracks seem out of place on this collection. They could've put a few more new songs in their placeto make it a whole, but I digress. Overall, this is one of the better Greatest Hits collections I've seen, way better than the greatest hits discs from BUCKCHERRY and coming soon NICKELBACK, both of which lack any new or rare material.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"
ALJYTAMVMRI58,B00EULQFR2,5.0,"If you&#8217;re looking for contemporary gospel music for the holidays, then check out Marvin Sapp&#8217;s Christmas Card, a collection of original holiday songs that&#8217;s seasoned with a few contemporary arrangements of the classics.  Highlights include the opening track &#8220;Feels Real Good&#8221; that&#8217;s bound to get the holiday spirits in high gear, the feel-good &#8220;Home For Christmas&#8221; that&#8217;s a collab with R&B singer Joe, and the two songs that reunite Sapp with his former group Commissioned&#8212;the acoustic rendition of &#8220;What Child Is This&#8221; and the newly composed &#8220;Honor the King.&#8221;  Closing out the album is Sapp&#8217;s uptempo &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get It Twisted,&#8221; reminding everyone that while Santa and Frosty are lots of fun, you gotta keep Christ in Christmas.

A2L35CRT620C4Z,B00EULQJXM,5.0,"This is a stunning Christmas album with a number of pleasant surprises. Johnny, at age 78, proves he can still boogie with a great up tempo take on Donny Hathaway's \"This Christmas\" and, backed by the Jordanaires, he gives a Nashville touch to \"Home for the Holidays.\"  Others have already lauded the gorgeous duet with Susan Boyle on \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" but I think the selection that moves me most is the pairing of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" with \"White Christmas.\" Johnny sings with both Vince Gill and Amy Grant on this medley and it takes my breath away. I had never felt the anguish of either song as much as I do in this inspired coupling. Much credit for this beautiful album must go to Fred Mollin, the producer, because, not only are the arrangements intelligent and fresh, but the sound and balance are flawless. As a lover of acoustic guitar, I have never heard this instrument used more effectively than on this album. Just listen to the beginning of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" and you'll know what I mean. I hope Fred Mollin produces Johnny's next album for it's clear that they bring out the best in each other.  \"Sending You a Little Christmas\" is the most wonderful holiday album Johnny has done since his very first one over 50 years ago. Christmas and Mathis: still perfect together!"
A1ORW3EDDHMB92,B00EULQJXM,5.0,"Classic Mathis. If any one artist can \"own\" Christmas, it is Johnny Mathis. With new, fresh and interesting arrangements and orchestrations by Gordon Goodwin, this latest Mathis Christmas album is sure to please."
AH1KJ45IQTM4T,B00EUS9IBU,4.0,"I bought the Target special edition yesterday, and this is so good I felt compelled to write a review. The Target edition comes with bonus tracks (12+2+1=15 tracks) AND the DVD 'A Rendez-vous With Paul McCartney,' a 22 minute outstanding and essential video interview that shows the 'Out There' tour. The Target price is $16.99 plus taxes, but yesterday it was marked down to $12.99 plus taxes. Just for the DVD, this is worth the price. But wait ... the CD itself ... !!! Oh my ... top notch! The first time you listen to this, it hooks you up already. The more you listen, of course, the better it gets. I find many different moods and musical places where I feel comfortable, challenged, comforted, and lifted. I have most of McCartney records, and of course, all of The Beatles albums. I'd rank this new release among the Top 10 of Paul's records (I am not considering The Beatles in this Top 10, obviously). This release comes with a very nice booklet with lyrics, many beautiful pictures of him and the band, and the gatefold contains a letter from Paul to us, the fans ... He calls us 'Dear you ...\" Very moving! If you like The Beatles or Paul McCartney, this is a must. I'd definitely recommend the edition with the DVD because of the added value. Again, Target has the best price around."
AACF0ZY9V2288,B00EUS9IBU,3.0,"I APPRECIATE THE SELLER AND THAT I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IN A TIMELY MANNER. THEREFORE I AM ONLY TRYING TOSHARE MY CRITIQUE IN ONLY ONE PLACE THAT REALLY MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING AT ALL. AMAZON, NOR THE SELLER HAVE ANY PART OF THIS REVIEW.I CANNOT EVER IN MY LIFE EVER THOUGHT PAUL'S VOICE BEING WHAT IS NOW. I UNDERSTAND NOW THAT HE'S PAST HIS SIXTIES AND I CAN'T EXPECT HIM TO BE WHAT HE ISN'T ANY MORE HIS VOICE ISN'T ANY LONGER WHAT IT USED TO BE.I WOUND UP TRADING THE CD WITH ANOTHER FROM A GOOD FRIEND. GOD BLESS PAUL AND ALL HIS FAN BASE. I AM STILL A FAN OF HIM AS MUCH AS THE BEATLES, BUT I JUST COULDN'T BEAR LISTENING AGAIN. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE PAUL AND RINGO AND THE REST OF THEM AND MAY TONY;STEWART;JOHN & GEORGE REST IN PEACE. LOVE THEM ALSO."
A1EO5YR1238VL3,B00EUS9IBU,2.0,"Okay - I've listened to this a couple of times. Paul's voice is pretty creaky. I don't have a problem with a dude's voice getting ragged. You can change your material to accommodate your voice - writers do it all the time. On this record, Scared (a hidden track after Road)is the best example of material that can benefit from Paul's older voice. Unfortunately its the last and only song to exploit what remains, rather than papering over it. Frankly, it's shocking how many tunes on this record use Paul's falsetto - which is perhaps even more tired than his actual voice. It's an example perhaps of McCartney's hubris, or his various producers cowardice not to have cut this misstep off at the pass. Instead, it's so overused I found myself wondering why this CD wasn't titles Falsetto instead of New.The quality of the songs on this record are a mixed bag. Early Days is excellent top to bottom.  But when things like Appreciate make it onto a record as something other than a bonus track, it's clear the offering is padded. Indeed, many of the songs are textbook throw away McCartney, where slap dash lyrics abound. One of the most disappointing aspects of New is what's missing: the piano ballad. Paul can generally craft great piano ballads - there's usually one per record, but only Scared approaches the style. It's really too bad, because this is probably where Paul's talent as a singer is most intact - but maybe he wants to avoid that image and it's implications of age.Finally, the production on New is just not happening. The guitar riff on Save Us is probably one of the best licks on the record, and it sounds like it was plugged straight into the mixing board then distorted - ala Black Dog - but a thousand times more so. It doesn't even sound like a guitar anymore. Now, when someone you are working with makes a decision to guild the lily on your best stuff, what can they be trusted with at all? This record is so overproduced - but not in the standard McCartney fashion - instead, it adds layers of reverb-drenched modern sounds that force themselves into the songs, ultimately making a lesser effort contrived as well."
A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"For me it is hard to review McCartney albums, I was ten years old with John Lennon was killed and it was the first I'd heard the Beatles and really the first time I was excited by music.  My parents had all of the albums so I pretty much listened to the Beatles non-stop from the ages of 10-13.  Each and every song imprinted on me and solidly putting McCartney and Lennon as the greatest songwriters in the world in my mind.I have followed Paul throughout the years and I have to admit there are hits and misses in his catalog, mainly because he is not afraid to take chances and push his music into new territories.  I loved his last album of standards \"Kisses on the Bottom\" but was also ready for a new album of McCartney songs.Here on \"New\" McCartney does not disappoint.  There are some flashes and homages to previous work but there are also strides into new territory.  McCartney worked with four young producers on this album and that may be one of the reasons that things do seem fresh on most of the tracks.\"SAVE US\" - The album kicks off with a bang with \"Save Us\" a song that rocks pretty damn hard with distorted guitars and heavy drum beat.  Not bad for a guy now over 70 years old!  The track features McCartney doing everything himself except playing the drums and he is in fine form vocally and on the guitar and bass.\"ALLIGATOR\" - You can't tell it from the name, but this mid-tempo song is about wanting a companion to be there for all facets of life, someone to share everything with.  There's no doubt Paul's new wife is having an effect on his songs and in a good way.  Some very cool guitar work here and a bit of a psychadelic synthesizer make this one memorable.\"ON MY WAY TO WORK\" - A ballad that is vintage McCartney telling a story about a guy longing for the girl of his dreams.  Nice acoustic guitar and Paul's voice is showcased nicely here.  Some heavier guitar in the instrumental break moves the song along.\"QUEENIE EYE\" - A \"life's a game song\" written about a game Paul used to play as a kid.  From an interview: \"Now this song, 'Queenie Eye,' is based on a game we used to play when I was a kid. You got to remember that's a long time ago and basically in kind of a poor area I was from. What you did you entertain yourself was go out in the street and play street games. There wasn't that much traffic, so you were pretty safe. And one of the games was called 'Queenie Eye.'\"  Repetetition and lyrical rhyming will have to getting this song stuck in your head for days.\"EARLY DAYS\" - One of my favorite tracks on the album.  As the title would lead you to believe this is a song about Paul's early days in music, viewing it all as a grand adventure that nobody can ever take away from him.  His vocals very up front over an acoustic guitar make you feel like you're just sitting in a room and listening to Sir Paul on the guitar.  Somewhere John Lennon is smiling.\"NEW\" - The first single from the record that announced to us all that Paul was ready to get back to rocking after the last album of standards that he recorded.  \"New\" is a happy, bouncy song that does not seem to get old no matter how many times you've heard it.  It is a song that stands up there with some of Paul's best pop songs.  Here we are so many years and albums into an amazing career and Paul is still doing what he can to keep things \"new\" and succeeding pretty well indeed!  There's a great little vocal play at the end that reminds me of Bobby McFerrin's work.\"APPRECIATE\" - This song starts with a dark, but killer groove that just broods through the song.  McCartney's vocals are distorted a bit and run through a flanger at times giving the vocals a cool vibe as he tells us to \"appreciate the day.\"  Great guitar work and some powerful percussion make this a song that can, pun intented, be very much appreciated.\"EVERYBODY OUT THERE\" - This one is probably included just to be able to play it live.  A fun song with some call and response lyrics that will surely be a hit with concert audiences.  This one features an 11-piece string section and what is billed as the \"McCartney Family Chorus.\"  The song also carries a great message from Paul for us to \"do some good before you say good-bye.\"\"HOSANNA\" - An acoustic ballad that features the lyrics \"I want to hold you in my arms, I want to take you to my heart again.\"  Not a bad song, but one that seems to be missing a little something.  There are some \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" type guitars at the end, but they don't really save the song.\"I CAN BET\" - This one is a rocker!  It is an \"I'm going to get the girl\" track with a bit of sass from Sir Paul who says that after looking her straight in the eye and pulling her closely \"what I'm going to do next I'll leave entirely to your imagination.\"  Paul has more game at his age than most rockers half his age, deal with it!\"LOOKING AT HER\" - A sweet love song with a bit of an edge.  Pure genius how the vibe of the vocals and music changes when the topic moves from Paul describing the woman and then when Paul describes what she does to him.  \"I'm losing my mind\" Paul repeats as the guitars get distored and the music stops.  Truly excellent songwriting.\"ROAD\" - A song that could be about a romantic relationship but could also be a song about his old pal John Lennon with lyrics like \"We came from nowhere\" and \"Two crazy partners\" who are looking for a spark.  An interesting piece that slows down and speeds up and ends on a high note.\"TURNED OUT\" - This is way too good of a song to be a bonus track.  The song is classic McCartney with ringing guitars and catchy lyrics.  \"I took a chance and what good thing, it turned out to be,\" Paul sings about finding love.  I think everyone has turned down a chance or two along the way and Paul's advice here is clear, take a chance!\"GET ME OUT OF HERE\" - A bluesy track that is also way too good to be just on the \"deluxe\" versions of the album.  Paul singing with an acoustic guitar and drum beat that really does feel like an old-time blues song.  \"I'm a celebrity, someone get me out of here,\" Paul sings with tongue firmly in cheek.  This one makes me with McCartney and Clapton would sit down and just jam out some acoustic blues numbers.\"SCARED\" - This one is another bonus track, but truly one of the best the album has to offer.  It's one of the most stark, emotional songs on the album about trying to express deep feeling to someone.  \"The beautiful birds won't fly out of their cage though I'm trying to set them free,\" Paul sings over a piano background.The perfect way to end the US version of the record, and I am sure McCartney's fans will have no problem letting Sir Paul know just how they feel about him.\"STRUGGLE\" - Only available on the Japanese editions of \"New.\"  \"Struggle\" is the most electronic sounding of anything on \"New,\" it sounds more like something that would have been more at home on one of McCartney's \"Fireman\" albums.  Lots of echo around the vocals here as Paul talks about \"life's eternal stuggles\" and the song ends in just a mishmash of noises.  Experimental, but still kind of cool.There is no doubt in my mind that McCartney can still write a hit song and this album proves it.How does it stack up against the Beatles' catalog and McCartney's past works?  That is up for you to decide, but I think it is a very good record that I will be playing for a long time.  There are already some songs that have grown on me more with just two or three listens, to me that is certainly a good sign that this album is something special.The bottom line here is \"New\" is highly recommended."
A1E7S6MMB2B061,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,I am so glad that Paul has released a new CD. I wish he would release more CDs more often.
A1IBG0W7OUGY81,B00EUS9IBU,2.0,Um well Being a big McCartney fan from the beginning i was hoping for something good i really liked his last album when i listened to it when it came out in 2007 but the problem is i haven't listened to it since that's my dilemma with recent MacCartney it sounds great at the time but not enough to listen to it again and again. very different from his past work with wings and early solo stuff  which i could listen to the old stuff all the time.  honestly  this stuff it's quite forgettable. i find recent music by Dylan way more interesting.  these are the songs that i do like on the NEW Album.Save meAlligatorQueenie eyeAppreciatei can betGet me out of here.
AKYCVQN0EN2T8,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"I don't remember hearing a McCartney album that was both Beatlesque and Beatlesworthy from beginning to end, without any Wings clunkers along the way. This is it. A first in his solo career and from that perspective his best outing since Let It Be. Certainly on a par with his last three pop CDs, and all together constituting one of the great comebacks in music history. Almost unimaginable that someone past 70 is capable of such work. Even the hidden track 'Scared', the only ballad on the CD, is a gem. If I hadn't known from the outset, I never would have guessed that four producers worked on the project. Bravo Beatle Paul McCartney, without whom The Beatles would certainly not have been the Beethoven of the second half of the 20th century. Which they were."
A2XVBFM1E26KUM,B00EUS9IBU,4.0,"Just like his last 3 albums this one has 3 songs that are REALLY good, well worth the price of the whole album.New, Queenie Eye and Early Days are superb songs, with that special unique McCartney magic that has made so famous.The rest of songs are fillers and nothing to call home about.However if you are are a macca fan, and you realize how amazing it is for him to still be giving us some awesome music at 72 years of age, you will keep abusing the repeat button on those 3 songs."
ALEI9AOWYBKU8,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"I just finished listening to Paul McCartney's latest studio album, New, on my PC with a pair of headphones. I've been a huge fan of The Beatles as well as a fan of most of Paul McCartney's and John Lennon's solo work for many years now. (I even have two compilations and an album from George Harrison and a compilation and an album from Ringo Starr.) That said, I can see that Paul McCartney was THE creative force behind the genius of the Beatles' music because of the many solo and live albums that I own from him. You can tell from the structure of the songs.I know some of you think Macca (McCartney's nickname) has hung on too long, but I respectfully disagree. I used to be in that camp myself, for the record. Then, I listened to a lot of his solo work. That's really what I grew up on, certainly much more so than the music of The Beatles until high school and beyond.I am amazed at just how consistently good Macca's New is! He's making the best solo music of his career and on the worldwide Out There Tour at 72 years young! Unbelievable!The \"deluxe edition\" of New, which is the only version that I've seen since its release, has 14 tracks and one hidden track at the end. There were four hip producers who helped him with this record but each of them on different tracks. Two of the hip producers are Mark Ronson, he of Amy Winehouse's Back to Black fame, which dominated the Grammy Awards in 2008, and Giles Martin, son of the legendary Beatles producer, George Martin. However, the album itself is the most cohesive or consistent album of his career. It's solid from start to finish with mostly faster, more rocking tracks and some well-placed slower tracks in between.I'm actually going to listen to it again right now! That's how good it is! If you still have your doubts, then listen to some samples on Amazon's website or at Spotify. In fact, I think Spotify is the better choice. (Sorry, Amazon! ha!)Finally, I recommend the following from Macca's solo discography: Band on the Run; Venus and Mars; At the Speed of Sound (try and get the 1993 remasters -- or later -- with bonus tracks for the first three albums listed here); Wings Over America (his best live album which went to #1 in 1976); Tug of War (1993 remaster); All the Best (1987 compilation); Flowers in the Dirt (1993 remaster with bonus tracks); Tripping the Live Fantastic (another great live album from the 1989-90 Flowers in the Dirt world tour, which was Macca's comeback album); Off the Ground; Flaming Pie; Wingspan: Hits & History (2001 2-CD compilation); Good Evening, New York City CD/DVD combo (live album released in 2009 with Macca's tight band from the last decade); and, of course, New.ADDITIONAL COMMENTS: I just finished listening to New for the third time in the last 24 hours. That's probably all you need to know about how good Sir Paul's latest release is. I think it's the best and most consistently great album he's ever released in his solo career, which began in 1970. Let me repeat part of that last statement or, in other words, rephrase it. This is the best solo album Paul McCartney has ever released! There's not a weak song on it. The title track, New, also sounds like it could have been released around the time of Penny Lane in 1967 because of the piano, horns, and vocals. I never thought anything would ever top Venus and Mars or Band on the Run, ranked respectively, but I think New is as good as or even better than those two albums. I think the band that he's playing with now is also the best and most talented group of musicians that Sir Paul has ever played with in his solo career.FINAL COMMENT: You might want to consider buying Run Devil Run as well as Chaos and Creation in the Backyard."
AP8NE54D3AWVZ,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,I REALLY LIKE THIS CD FROM PAUL. I'M A BEATLES FAN SINCE 64. PAUL STILL CAN WRITE SONGS. THIS IS A GOOD CD TO LISTEN TO.
A2VL611VQPMIJE,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,I have always been a huge Beatles fan! I have not always enjoyed Paul's solo efforts but this is a very good CD-it reminds me of the Beatles!
ATA8H1N7VNO56,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"For me, this is the most consistently excellent album McCartney has made. The writing and arrangements are inspired and New. The songs are distinctively different from each other and yet all fit together for a terrific listening experience. At 71, McCartney is much younger than many artists half his age. It is hard to pick a favorite song on the CD and the 2 extra tracks hold their own with the rest. No filler here. Thank you Sir Paul !!"
A2H8YPSZ3RN6BU,B00EUS9IBU,4.0,For many years I liked all of Paul McCartney's music.  I have not really enjoyed the last few albums he made except for a few songs here and there. .
A2BLM112KJ1H3R,B00EUS9IBU,4.0,"If you enjoy McCartney's style of music making you will like this album. Some say its New, To me Its just Paul making his style of music.  Had to hear it a few times to get the feel of the songs. This is a very good album of music. Paul's vocals are older in sound now, but still very good, even with the help of the studio mixing. Some vocals are to far back in the mix, not as up front as the older albums of Paul. Reminds me a lot of Ram in the structure of the songs. Some of the best for me are, On My Way To Work, Every Body Out There, Looking At Her, Qweenie Eye, Appreciate, Get Me Out Of Here, I Can Bet, Get the Deluxe cd with the extra songs. I also have the vinyl, The best sound to me."
A38CWQHV6DRROT,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"With any luck at all, this vital and important release will propel Paul to take to the stage performing just Paul McCartney songs. No Beatles. Just McCartney. He can start with 'Save Us' from NEW and work through three hours of 'My Brave Face', 'Put It There', 'Tug of War', 'Sing The Changes', 'The Songs We Were Singing', 'Helen Wheels', and mucho more. After fifty years of giving the people what they want, it's time we free McCartney from the musical museum we've put him in, and let him manifest his great, boundless talent, like he did all those years ago."
A142UVI9O7XNHF,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"This is truely one of Paul's best solo albums. Ive been listening to this from begining to end almost exclusively since it's release, and it just gets better with each listen. The writing, production and performance on every track is as sharp as anything he's done in years. There is a sense of confidence and joy that has been missing in some of his past work (pre-Chaos and Creation) . There is only one song I think might have been better, and that is &#34;Everybody Out There&#34;. As it stands, I think it's a really good song, but of all the songs on the album, this is the only one that seems half written, something that was unfortunately common on many of his past albums. If he had only completed the 2nd verse rather than simply finish it with the &#34;eveybody out there&#34; refrain, and maybe added one more verse, I think this would have been one of his great songs, instead of being simply really good. Still, as it stands, the verse, chorus, and performance are so strong that it is terrific just the way it is.I really like both songs he released as singles, but I can't help but feel &#34;I Can Bet&#34; was the most obvious and strongest song to be the single release. There's something about it that reminds me of &#34;Help&#34; era Paul."
A2YOEYF1R5Y3ZK,B00EUS9IBU,5.0,"IT'S PAUL. IT IS ALWAYS A GIFT FROM HIM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JUST A FEW SONGS, THIS ALBUM IS FULL OF HIS UNIQUE CREATIVITY & BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. I NEVER TIRE OF LISTENING TO ANY OF HIS MUSIC. AS ALWAYS, HIS LYRICS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS PROFOUND."
A2UZ0TR4XKZ2ZU,B00EUUJICM,5.0,My family watched American Idol and picked Scotty from the beginning.  My daughter still mocks me because I never dreamed America would let this fantastic country singer through!  (We live in rural Montana and love country music.)  Glad the majority of Americans voting felt the same way as my family.  He has been a great role model; so far.
A23Y3TRHWY78KF,B00EUUJICM,5.0,Choose this cd because I am a big fan of country music & enjoy the smooth voice as well as the up beat to all the songs on his cd
A2FO24JT0RM91P,B00EUUJICM,2.0,"Scotty McCreery's third release, \"See You Tonight\" is designed to market the season 10 American Idol champ as a more mature artist. Armed with songwriting heavies like Preston Burst and Kyle Jacobs along with a guest vocal from Alison Krauss, it might work on paper. But in the end, he proves that his wheelhouse remains fun contemporary songs driven by his boy next door charm.Ironically, for a fall release, the album is heavy on summertime themed tracks and upbeat party anthems. From \"Feel Good Summer Song\" to \"Feelin' It\" there are plenty of lines about sand, sun and flip-flops. Producer Frank Rogers (Brad Paisley) keeps the mix glossy and upbeat. With the exception of a few rockers featuring traditional fiddle and pedal steel, the album is easily suited for Top 40.McCreery's distinctive baritone occasionally gives way to a newfound tender upper register which at times works well but also feels watered down. It works best on the poignant highlight On The Dash, where he perfectly evokes the intensely deep meaning of a headstone at the memorial of a man who died in service to his country\"It ain't about the numbers chiseled in concrete; it's how they lived their lives in the dash in betweenMcCreery flexes his own songwriting muscles with Rogers on the  closer Something  More. Even though the album doesn't seem to achieve its goal of painting the Idol winner as a more mature artist, he stayed with his core competency as one with a contemporary bent. For a 20-year-old college sophomore, there is still plenty of time to grow up.For all the latest music news GO To: [...]"
A3CQIAN8U0TYVX,B00EUUJID6,5.0,Great Album.  We have been following these 3 since their debut on Public Television and thoroughly enjoy watching them grow in the professional field.  This album is great listening material for in the car or at home.
A3UT9ERV8S8M9J,B00EUUJID6,5.0,"If you've not had the opportunity to hear these young men, please get one of their CDs asap!  This Christmas CD is absolutely beautiful."
AZBFTX7U4S79U,B00EV1AR7U,5.0,"Great album very simplistic album cover and artwork, great sound and amazing content on this album definitely a must have album if you are a hip hop/ rap head!"
A2UOHALGF2X77Q,B00EV1ARX4,5.0,"I'm usually not a fan of Christmas releases from my favorite bands, but 'Snow Globe' doesn't disappoint. It's not a typical Christmas CD. As Andy Bell once said of Vince Clarke: \"Everything he touches turns to gold\". Vincent Clarke truly is a musical genius. 'Snow Globe' is a mix of timeless Christmas songs that Andy sings flawlessly, some pop-dance mixes, and a couple original songs that have a little bit of a dark side. If you're an Erasure fan, or maybe just looking for something different this holiday season, then I recommend adding \"Snow Globe\" to your music collection."
AV7CO2J7XO9VR,B00EVSABD8,4.0,"When Linda and Richard Thompson were together they were a dynamite team. I have seen Linda perform and spoke with her backstage a few years past. Happy to say, this is a total revelation. I am a radio DJ and never fail to bring this CD to my radio show."
A1JUKS0DSO2XZG,B00EVVA4OG,5.0,"I tried this album on spec. because I loved Brandy Clark's song Follow Your Arrow on Kacey Musgraves' album Same Trailer, Different Park.  I was prepared for it not to be very good because quite a lot of people have written one or two good songs and a lot of mediocre stuff, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a collection of varied, enjoyable and very well-crafted country songs which tell their stories with humour, insight and genuine pathos at times.Brandy Clark writes good straightforward tunes and sings them well.  They are very well arranged and produced here, with a fine band and just the right degree of arrangement to let each one shine in its own way.  Her lyrics are very good indeed, with songs like Take A Little Pill making good, serious points about addiction and Stripes genuinely makes me tap my foot and smile (although I'd recommend that you avoid the video, which manages to drain all the dry wit from the song).This album was a really enjoyable discovery for me.  I think Brandy Clark is a genuinely talented and entertaining singer/songwriter with a rare gift for insight and wit expressed in really enjoyable melodies.  I'll definitely be looking out for her future work, and recommend this very warmly."
A1KOY0A56WH03E,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,"If you're a fan of pop music with a heavy dance and electronic influence, I find it hard to imagine you wouldn't enjoy this album. I love Lady Gaga's past music, but I think ARTPOP is my favorite album of hers as a whole. The songs sound great alone, but together is where they really shine and make for a really fun listening experience. The energy, from start to finish, is like a fantastic rave celebration, with the exception of the song Dope, which is more reminiscent of Speechless from The Fame Monster. I also have to mention Gaga's vocals on ARTPOP are just SICK, she sounds better than ever in many songs here. I've listened to it multiple times at this point and I haven't tired of it yet. Definitely one of the best pop albums of the year. If you love Gaga, you'll love this album."
A6FO090D3B9JM,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,I love every song on this album.  I have listened to it many times already.  I always love Lady Gaga.
AP37T7UPLQGWU,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,"I'm a recent Gaga convert.  I have listened to her headliners over the years when I'm listening to the radio, but only recently I decided to check out her iTunes Festival performance.  She seems to be REALLY into her fans, and I dig that in musicians.  It adds an extra layer to the performance.So I decided to give this album a go, as &#34;Applause&#34; has been the most successful ear-worm of all time, in my brain.  This album did not fail to impress, and I have listened to it beginning to end four times now.  I can't find a single track that I want to skip - I just listen to them all.The difference between Gaga and the other current female pop stars is that she has a fantastic voice.  My wife showed me an acoustic video of her performing Paparazzi on the piano (just her in a studio - no electronic devices), and her voice is simply incredible.  Girl's got raw talent.On to the audio quality!  I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I usually listen to music through a headphone amplifier into my Sennheiser HD595 headphones.  Not uber rich, but very sonically clear.  I bought this album in mp3 version rather than getting the CD to rip into ALAC because I figured it would be compressed to garbage, like most pop music is today.  I'm pleasantly surprised that the studio mastering on this album is VERY good.  Everything is really clear with virtually no distortion or audible compression throughout the entire album.The album sounds so aurally good that it almost makes me wish I had purchased the CD to get a full lossless rip.  Nonetheless, the 256kbps Amazon version sounds very good, and I'm very happy with this purchase.Love her or hate her, buy this album, and you won't be able to get these songs out of your head for a long time.  :)"
A8NIZAIRT4EF7,B00EW9GQR6,4.0,"I purchased this CD for my tweens birthday. She is a serious Lady Gaga fan and loves this CD. Personally, I think this is one of Gaga's best. Great purchase."

A3DUY3FHH21T3T,B00EW9GQR6,1.0,"Damn it gaga your're just proving what i've been thinking about you all along, and that is that you've got no talent what so ever when it comes to music. It seems lady gaga has now thought it was time to release a new record, but what a shock this album \"Art Pop\" is an abomination on music as well as her other previous albums, she has brought nothing new to her fans or to the others who could potentially in time become fans. This album has brought the same old formula dance electro pop beats and a weak production on set without any thought put behind the music or lyrics, how people think she's creative and diverse is beyond me.The album \"Art Pop\" say's nothing more than you already knew about gaga since day 1, in fact i've learned more about the person gaga through her segment's on youtube or MTV and NOT once has she expressed her passion for music or drive there of...so why is she in the music industry again ?Lady gaga's all but 5 minutes of fame should have been expired a long time ago, i mean 4 or 5 albums and in with the same pre packaged trash and she's still selling ??? this actually say's more about today's society than it does about gaga's so called ability to produce competent music."
A24EXRGZ24WZ22,B00EW9GQR6,4.0,"While everyone was on their &#34;Gaga&#34; Craze some years ago with &#34;Fame Monster&#34; She should have released this one instead of &#34;Born This Way&#34;. This album pretty much defines who she is as a person. I did like &#34;Born This Way&#34; better but this one is more of a follow up to her first album. Its definitely what you would expect from her. Top 5:1. G.U.Y - This song is addictive and very reminiscent of Bad Romance to me2. Sexxx Dreams - Man this has such an awesome 80s sound! Love the chorus and how it drips sex without it being too sleazy... I don't think lol3. Do What You Want - Love the two of the together, but Im waiting on the lesbian version of her and Christina to come out!!4. Dope - This song is dope. Reminds me Speechless but much more rough around the edges.5. Venus - Just a fun pop song. Love when she mentions Uranus and says &#34;You know my ass is famous!&#34; Anyone notice the reference of Penis to Venus? Sounds like she says it a few times lol"
A3OLIQA10QRBMO,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,I'm always amazed how much I enjoy the next new album from her. She always out does herself with each new album!
A83SHN0AIWDMT,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,"what a talent!......lyrics and talent of the performer to write and perform are key for me just like Cyrus and Eminem...like socially,thought provoking lyrics despite the language ,,Gaga for Artpop!"
A280BTWBX9ZPTX,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,She sounds familiar yet so freshen up.. she is definitely one of a kind and either you hate her or love her SHE HAS TALENT and that is an undeniable fact!
AFKBKR8P730C2,B00EW9GQR6,2.0,"Is it just me or do most of the songs on this album sound the same? The only songs I really like on this album are the last three. Dope, Gypsy and Applause. A couple of others like &#34;Do What You Want&#34; are okay... but aren't that great. I was really hoping for something better than Born This Way. If she lives for the applause as she says, I believe she will soon be dead."
A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B00EW9GQR6,4.0,"I've been looking forward to \"ARTPOP\" for a long time, and while I enjoy the album very much, it reminds me so much of Lady Gaga's previous work. Nothing wrong with that, but it's nice to see music evolve after a while, you know? Any of these tracks could easily be from one of her prior albums...that's how similar the styles are. Favorite tracks for me are \"Applause,\" the first single off the album; \"Gypsy,\" and the emotional ballad titled, believe it or not, \"Dope.\" The other songs are all very good, but nothing really rocked me to the core. It's all more of the same Gaga. Very good, but I was expecting something more."
ABWSROMAAMG85,B00EW9GQR6,1.0,I personally never could stand anything about her BUT i recently just realized after listening to her new album....I absolutely positivly CAN&#34;T stand her. She act's like GOD is apart of her life yet I hear her yelling every foul word there is including GOD'S name in vain. Everybody that follows her is brain washed just as she is. She is a major cause of the constant growth of human stupidity. As long as the Lady Gaga's and Miley Cirus clones keep popping up we might as well claim that Earth has been over run by Aliens.
AWWLM620NDYV5,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,I just can't help but just love lady gaga!and the new album is just pure awesomness !thanks for making my whole family have fun with your music
A2ZNJEU7ZTRJZZ,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,Its just a great album to listen to.  I mix it into my Pop music shuffle and enjoy the variety she adds to the playlist.  You don't have to like her persona to like her music.
ADIDQNX473BY3,B00EW9GQR6,5.0,"If you have a problem with \"Artpop\", then you're ticked off that she has 2 songs collaborating with rap musicians.  Now, I am not a rap fan but of the two songs, \"Jewels and Drugs\" and \"Do What you Want\", I think the collaboration works best on \"Do What You Want\".  Now I have seen some criticisms about this album which seems to say, \"Gee, she's not doing constant THUMP-A-THUMP-A-THUMP, she's horrible/I'm not going to buy her stuff anymore\".  Really? Are you that shallow?  A lot of artists who change their style, usually fail, but I think that Gaga has improved with this album. I went in with this purchase without hearing any of the music, solely based on her previous albums.  I'm glad that I took the chance.  I can look forward to Gaga's future work with great expectations."
A1FTYII733AD4C,B00EWJ3XYU,2.0,I just  expected more and got less. Artists and song renditions didn't do it for me. Try it; maybe you'll like it.
AGIRKGXSRDJ4L,B00EWV68SG,5.0,"I was delightfully surprised at how great this album was.  Levin once again has pulled some wonderful magical strings to make another collaborative album.  Cudos to you all.For those who have discovered the genius of Tony Levin, this is for you.  Loved every track, many time it got me moving to the beat so to speak.Great stuff!"
AZPSA2VYPA9VV,B00EWV68SG,5.0,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this collaboration.  There were Levin and Rudess, who had recorded and played together in Liquid Tension Experiment.  Heavy stuff, sometimes loud, sometimes not, but a bit of a jam vibe.  The Levin Minnemann Rudess project has a more completed song structure feel, at least to me.  Obviously their chops are without question.  Tony Levin has his own unique style and sound, and I've followed him for years.  Jordan Rudess gained his popularity and praise through Dream Theater.  As for Marco Minnneman (MONSTER drummer) (and I saw him with Joe Satriana recently and he did not disappoint): I'm glad he didn't get the job with Dream Theater.  We would have missed his stick- and footwork with Steven Wilson, for sure.  Anyway, a neat grouping, definitely Prog, definitely a recording for musicians and fans of Prog music and all listeners of instrumental music of great prowess.  The accompanying DVD was both entertaining and enlightening, a good bonus.  And Marco on guitar? I did not know and was highly appreciative.  BUY THIS DISC!"
A2S0TMR69SMGC8,B00EWV68SG,5.0,Another CD that I played back to back to back once it got to my player.  What an amazing effort.
A3EBH278VPFDCB,B00EWV68SG,2.0,"I'm not why so many others have rated this so highly. I'm a huge fan of both jazz fusion and Progressive metal. I have a lot of respect for both Rudess and Minnemann as outstanding musicians. Levin is hugely overrated. Although there are some cool moments and great musicianship here and there on this album, overall, I found the compositions a little boring, and even monotonous in spots. Musically, it doesn't grab me like many other recordings from all of these musicians. I wasn't moved. I think most Dream Theater fans will be disappointed as well. Not nearly as good as Rudess/Levin's Liquid Tension Experiment recordings."
A1UIZKYKOTYWOB,B00EWV68SG,5.0,"It's great to see Marco Minnemann working with these two legendary musicians.  I first heard of Marco when he auditioned for Dream Theater.  He didn't get the gig (which he claims in interviews I have seen went to the right man, Mike Mangini) but he was not upset about it at all, and it did open other doors for him.  I think he is a sensational drummer (gotta like a guy who shows up to a big audition wearing a Cookie Monster t-shirt) and this album shows off not just his talent, but that of Levin and Rudess as well.  Great stuff all around."
A1Y80VJ4QTU6TL,B00EYQ6GXG,5.0,"What can anyone say?  The heart and soul of the Genesis band through their best years first comes out with 2 incredibly amazing cds re-interpreting the music of Genesis up to the Wind and Wuthering lp, which was Steve's last album with the band and now this live cd/DVD package comes out.  This 4 disc set (2 cds and 2 dvds) covers a performance from the Hammersmith during his recent Genesis Revisited Tour as well as a behind the scenes documentary.  I saw this show twice here in the US in 2013 and needless to say it didn't disappoint.  The band's playing was flawless and the song selection was terrific.  This particular live performance covers more songs than what Steve did here on his last US tour, so for me that in itself was a real bonus."
ALHORMFNOM9RH,B00EYQ6GXG,5.0,You Get The Full Concert In Audio And Video Plus A 5th Disc Of Interviews. A Real Bargain. Exceptional Quality.
AO5BOL30XDTLI,B00EYQ6GXG,5.0,"I still haven't listened to the audio disks in this set and probably never will.  Watching the live concert appearance(s) on the 2 DVDs transported me to the times when I saw Genesis live in the early to mid 70's.  Nad Sylvan (formerly with Swedish bands Unifaun and Agents of Mercy) perfectly captures the essence of Peter Gabriel from many years ago.  Perhaps the best example of this is his rendition of &#34;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight.&#34;Steve Hackett has done a remarkable job of recreating some of the older Genesis classics with Sylvan and several other lead vocalists.  As usual, Hackett and his band are outstanding throughout the performance."
A2F8M36IM5R1H1,B00EYQ6GXG,5.0,"Steve Hackett shows himself to be versatile as well as a guitar virtuoso.  This show lovingly and respectfully presents some of the best music Genesis ever released as well as some favorites from Hackett's solo catalog.  It's been said before, but Hackett's performances in the studio as well as onstage show just how much his playing contributed to Genesis' sound, even on pieces written by other band members.Now I finally have a live version of 'Afterglow' that is true to the power and emotion of the studio version.  By the time I saw the 'Wind & Wuthering' tour, the band had reworked the song's chorus using new drum and bass parts which IMO completely broke the song's flow and the entire coda seemed to be a platform  for the dueling drum fills of Collins and Thompson. This can be heard on the 'Seconds Out' CD.  That Steve has chosen to perform the song as it was done in the studio says a lot.  I'm grateful for the whole Genesis Revisited project that Hackett has brought to us.  Its hard to believe that these pieces are as old as they are; they are still vital and relevant, at least for me.  I really don't follow current music at all.  To my ears so much of it sounds the same from one artist to the next.  I still listen to what I grew up with: Yes, Genesis, King Crimson(Bruford era), Gentle Giant, Heart etc. etc.Steve Hackett deserves all the success he enjoys with the Genesis Revisited CDs and live shows.  God bless him for making us remember those days and this music.  More!!!"
A2MCQ2BII3OO29,B00EYQ6IBQ,4.0,"I am a big Joanne Shaw Taylor fan, so I was eager to hear her live. While I liked the album (hence the 4 stars), I did not give it 5 stars because it just didn't wow me. It was good and she played well, but I dd not hear sparks flying from her playing."
A2VFN33XFSDW9C,B00EYRWWCY,3.0,"Good Overall.  Bad has a good to great sound.  Not all songs are this good, but many are so worth buying the album when you get a deal."
A2ECYCMXNSYOPX,B00EZ0BNVG,4.0,"good sound track, however the last track gets funky when played on my computer, the other tracks are fine, as music goes it is very good otherwise"
A277CZ3P20LH74,B00EZ226QA,4.0,"After delivering an attention grabbing opus with their 2010 debut, Treats, Brookyln indie/noise rock duo Sleigh Bells ran into an identity crisis on the followup. Their sophomore release, Reign of Terror, was a hardcore noise rock album that was trying to be a mainstream pop album, and sounded like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be. It got stuck in an awkward gap between noise and pop, without suitably satisfying either side of the aisle. To make matters worse, the band had seemingly lost the edge that had turned so many heads on their debut, not to mention the fact that Krauss's continual cheerleader shouts added an air of superficiality to the whole affair.Now re-energized for their third go around, Sleigh Bells sound like a band intent on dominating the globe all over again. Bitter Rivals captures the sound of Sleigh Bells not messing around. The first four tracks all hit like laser guided torpedoes, guaranteed to get you fired up. \"Sugarcane\" hits like a jack knife with Derek Miller's buzzsaw guitar, while Alexis Krauss's lighter than air vocals provide a compelling contrast. The title track, meanwhile, sees Krauss's vocals hitting like a jackhammer in the verses, while still managing to toss in an oh so infectious chorus riff. The song's lyrics are also packed with attitude, as Krauss tells about her victorious confrontation with the town sheriff. Lyrically, the album still tends to be incoherent/scatterbrained in terms of lyrics, but it is clear they are meant to get the listener pumped up even if they tend to lack cohesion.\"Sing Like a Wire\" is the hardest hitting track the album has to offer. It sounds like a stadium/arena rock anthem that recalls shades of Treats with its pulsing and pounding electronic work and percussion. The album begins to slow down as it progresses, however. \"Young Legends\" and \"To Hell With You\" flash of heavy dose of girlpop vocal melodies, with the latter sounding like it literally could have been a Disney song if not for the loud, crashing guitars. \"Tiger Kit\" and \"You Don't Get Me Twice\" showcase the most successful blending of the band's pop and hardcore rock elements. \"Tiger Kit\" is one of the busiest tracks on disc, tossing in blaring electronics along with what sounds like disc scratching sounds to forge a pure adrenaline stomper.Softer pieces near the album's close turn to some elements rarely employed by the band. \"24\" has a high pitched guitar line that noodles and caroms all over the place, sounding not entirely unlike circus music. During the chorus, Miller switches over to some clean strumming that wouldn't sound out of place in an 80s hair metal ballad, but it manages to work when backed by Krauss's exuberant girlpop delivery. Sleigh Bells demonstrate the harder edged numbers are still their forte, but prove they can detour into softer material and pull out fine results most of the time.Bitter Rivals may not satisfy from start to finish, yet it is still a successful outing for this Brooklyn noise/pop outfit. It's filled with plenty of attitude and a hodgepodge of various far flung elements that seem like they should conflict but mostly don't. It won't overtake Treats as the crown jewel in their catalog, but will give it a good run for its money."
A1PJK5EGYP15OW,B00EZ226QA,2.0,i always thought these guys were kind of a one trick pony but everyone loved the second album more than the first so I thought I would give them another shot. this just sounds like b-sides from the first two albums. and with even more goofy kid samples and stupid lyrics than before. they really need to switch it up a bit
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00EZ3QSL8,5.0,"This compilation is dominated on the first CD by the Four Aces, a vocal group who occupy the first 17 tracks, and on the second CD by the Three Suns, an instrumental group who occupy the first 18 tracks. Both groups were brilliant at what they did, mostly but not entirely sticking to the songs that we now regard as Christmas classics. Away from Christmas music, the Four Aces toppedThe First US Top 100 November 12th 1955, being #1 at the time with their version of Love is a many-splendoured thing. I enjoy listening to the Christmas music by the Four Aces and the Three Tuns, but the remainder of each CD has plenty of great music too.The first CD continues with two tracks each by Fran Allison, Eddy Howard, Mindy Carson and Guy Lombardo with Kenny Gardner, all of them worth a listen. I already owned music by Mindy Carson and Guy Lombardo, and was not surprised at the high standard they set here. I knew nothing about Fran Allison or Eddy Howard, but I like what's here, particularly Dearest Santa (Eddy Howard), which sounds like it ought to be a country song but it isn't. It's one of those tear-jerkers about a child in poor circumstances; in this case he has no family but would like one to spend Christmas with.The first CD ends with seven tracks by either or both of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, which are well up to the standard I expect from this duo, but these tracks are NOT the ones featured on theirChristmas Is Always. If you have that album, you may want this album too, even if only for their tracks here.After the Three Suns have finished on the second CD, we are treated to two tracks by Dorothy Olson, one by the Merrill Staton Choir and two each by Johnny Desmond and Jill Corey. Jill's first track (The first Christmas gift) may be the pick of them, but it's hard to choose because they are all so good. Apart from the final track, the remainder of the second CD is occupied by Freddie Martin and his Orchestra, usually with a vocalist. I don't remember hearing his music before, but it sounds great.Sadly, the final track is a huge disappointment - not enough to knock a star off the rating as there are 66 great tracks here and it's easy to skip this one. Season's greetings is advertizing, plain and simple, performed by Margaret Whiting and an uncredired man, who talk and play clips (but not long enough to enjoy). Jasmine say it has been in the vaults unheard for sixty years. It should have stayed there. I love Margaret Whiting's music, have reviewed some of it and will review more, which I expect to be of her normal excellent quality. This track isn't excellent - quite the opposite.Buy this compilation for the first 66 excellent Christmas recordings amd forget the last track."
A3DID289Y9SI5J,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,Love Il Divo and song selection for this album is perfect. I have all their albums and DVD's and think they are the best!
A26GHK666ZGXTS,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,i'm a huge fan of il divo!  this is an excellent cd!  i will enjoy it for many years to come!
A3C4RWTDJ2YBFR,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,"Love these guys, they so a superb job of sharing the music with us all.  Love this album a lot."
A3CZNTNI8160RI,B00EZ8GADY,3.0,"When I purchase an Il Divo release it is made with the hope to hear those grand voices presenting more of the worlds greatest melodies and compositions. I was not happy this time to hear an audience in a tizzy and a series of duets with guest artists.It is hard to believe that Simon Cowell would have given his approval stamp to this. The pure Il Divo on this disc is, as usual, other-worldly and goes straight to the heart. But, when a group or a performer releases a collection of duets that only weaken the chosen music, it is often a sign that the jump the shark point has been reached. Certainly not true with Il Divo in spite of the several selections here that certainly sound like it. I know, I know that I should not have been surprised as, after all I can read. But I was smitten by so many of the titles that I blinded myself to the information about the others. Just listen, again, to the last track and see what the group gave up to the Diva who made their presence sound like she allowed her young cousins to join in on her performance."
A298PFTIVRVQWS,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,"Because IL Divo  is a great singing group, I buy whatever they come out.  This album like all their rest will not disappoint you.  Have been waiting since September when they announced it would be coming out."
A64OQHLB9EQDW,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,"Wonderful voices, wonderful selections.  Just as good as all of their other CD's.  You will not be disappointed in this one."
AVVEA0Z4U5PFB,B00EZ8GADY,4.0,"I would buy it again. These are old well known show tunes just as advertised, so you can hum or(if you are alone) sing along.I have enjoyed it and bought extra copies for Christmas gifts. I did not like as well as their earlier recordings because they were standards that  we all know and I would like to hear unique offerings from them."
A10QP8R783ZD3N,B00EZ8GADY,5.0,"Guess that says it all.  These four men have some really fine voices, and know how to put them together to create a sound that totals far more than the individual parts.  I really wish they would sing more in English, but regardless of that face, the sound is unbelievable"
A37OEKVLDFPG1E,B00EZ8GAHK,5.0,Even this is not sung by the Beatles the glee group does a great job of putting their feelings to the music to make it their own and that's fine with me.  I still love the original music by far the best but sometimes covers of music change it a bit to make it shine and they do it here.
A2SJ6OWEP8Y8SW,B00EZ8GAHK,4.0,Is a good interpretation of the most fabulous songs ever written. I didn't see  the series but i like what i hear.
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00EZ8GAHK,4.0,"Glee hasn't shied away from The Beatles before, including some very deft covers, like Chris/Kurt doing \"Blackbird.\" This time, though, they are tackling the Fab Four across two of the TV episodes and one full CD. Much like the attempts to do Madonna, Rocky Horror, or Grease, they're going all in. If you're a true purist who couldn't even tolerate the soundtrack to \"I Am Sam\" or \"Across The Universe,\" you might have issues. Surprisingly, however, Glee takes on a handful of fairly obvious Beatles classics and treats them with respect.I can't imagine what was going through the hearts and minds of the cast as they were taking on some of the more emotional heft of some of the songs here, so close to the passing of Cory Montieth/Finn. But when Lea Michelle opens up on \"Yesterday,\" you can hear the emotion pouring out. Easily the best performance of the album, even if any other circumstances surrounded it. For the most part, the arrangements are kept close to the originals, with the exception of \"Got To Get You Into My Life,\" where 'Klaine' mix it up with a marching band. On the TV episode, they even went as far as making a mock-up of the Ed Sullivan set for \"When I Saw Her Standing There.\"The CD does do a split between early and later Beatles, saving the music from the older period for the second episode. \"Get Back\" is stripped to just a piano version, and frankly, it's almost impossible to screw up \"Let It Be,\" \"Hey Jude\" or \"Here Comes The Sun\" while you're staying faithful to the arrangements. With \"Something\" being one of my top ten personal favorite Beatles songs, I'd take it as blasphemy to try and mess with the original. In fact, the only stumble on this disc is performing \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and then NOT following through with \"A Little Help From My Friends.\"When Glee started, this was the kind of music I was expecting from the show. The first two seasons did a lot to mix in classic pop, modern songs and show tunes in equal measure, to the point where I thought the \"Presents The Warblers\" was one of the best of the batch. For \"Glee Presents The Beatles,\" the do a service to some of these records that are inching towards their 50th Birthday, and that is bringing them to a whole new group of listeners. And that's something I'm all for happening."
AVUDWNR0QEE7T,B00EZEHI20,4.0,"Great additiion to my non-traditional Christmas music library. If you like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, you'll like these Christmas songs.My only dislike and reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the last several songs are too slow and didn't give me the fun filled swing feeling I get from the rest of the album and the rest of BBVD albums."
A2JDPF17IADCOC,B00EZP9U5C,5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my 87 yr old dad, he loves it so I love it. I did get to listen to some of the songs included alot of the great ballads and was welldone. Estefan has a great voice, but if you are used to the typical jazz singer like Jane Monheit it will be a little different, but still very good."
A2SPGHEJYJ819V,B00EZP9U5C,5.0,The more you listen the more you love it. After viewing the live show it is great to have the music.
A2N12YWDFN8A7I,B00EZPCYQ4,3.0,"My first exposure to this album was the video for 'I Hope You Suffer.' I was very intrigued and impressed that AFI are obviously going in a heavier, darker direction. I had high hopes for the rest of the album! (This from someone who thinks Black Sails and The Art of Drowning are their best works, followed by STS...and I don't like their pop stuff.)Unfortunately, they didn't keep up the pace and most of the album failed to grab me. The songs aren't bad; they just aren't stunning and I want stunning! I shouldn't have to 'try' to like a song, ya know? I found myself trying to like this album...really trying, and then I thought, hey, what am I doing? I never had to try to like the aforementioned masterpieces.The one notable exception is 'The Conductor.' That song alone stands out. Why? Because I didn't have to try to like it. It simply grabbed me and didn't let go.I don't analyze music while I'm listening to it. Either it works for me or it doesn't. AFTER I either like it or I don't, I might ask myself WHY. Why do I like The Conductor? Jade's guitar is very noticeable; I didn't really notice his guitar on most of the other tracks. Davey's voice is effortless and exquisite. And, it has just a touch of that 'anthem' feel.In all fairness, though, I'm going to give the whole album another listen."
A11BF3WX0WJ24N,B00EZPCYQ4,5.0,"Wow!!!  I've been a fan of these guys for quite some time, now.  It's been a joy watching them grow as musicians and songwriters, continuously improving and honing their skills with each subsequent release.  They didn't merely impress me with this latest release....they blew me away!  Give it a listen and enjoy a very tight and exciting band that is on top of its game!  Truly delicious!"
A1PGBSR6I9HPO0,B00F05P8J8,2.0,"The songs are okay.  However, the songs contain more of the background singers singing,  than \"Boy George.\"This Boy George sounds completely different.  This is not the vocalist that sings, 'Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?\"  What happened?  If you are looking to hear the vocalist of the 80's, you will not hear that vocalist here.Sorry, I'm not a fan!  If his vocals have changed, than perhaps a year or two with a vocalist coach could coax the former vocals back.  In addition, regardless of the great messages some of these songs evokes the unusual/unique/strange vocals are distraction."
A9DMBEAVI7V8D,B00F0JG9QA,5.0,I first saw John Hiatt on Imus in the Morning. Never heard of him prior to that. I was hooked after that. If you like country mixed with folk and a little rock you need this album. Great band backup and great vocals by John.
AZH6BSTHRDZR1,B00F0JGA6E,5.0,"I had heard of this soundtrack but had not heard it before.  I specialize listening to Broadway Musicals so I purchased a CD, turned it on and really enjoyed the musicals story and much loved the music.  I think anyone interested in musicals would enjoy this."
A3HLD8L1CZC6MW,B00F0JGA6E,5.0,I love it because I saw the play in New York and every time I listen to it I can see the stage performance in my mind.
A2UT2IJ9MYUMYQ,B00F0MNDKW,5.0,WHAT A TRAGEDY HE PASSED AWAY SO YOUNG!  THIS ALBUM IS JUST FABULOUS AND WHAT REALLY KNOCKS ME OFF MY FEET IS THAT IT IS JUST A TRIO AND THEY KEEP THE BALL ROLLING THE ENTIRE SET...NO RHYTHM GUITAR OR KEYBOARDS.
A1J8MD5BAMCA06,B00F0MX866,5.0,"For those proclaiming Cage is over or has gone emo, really need to do your homework. 'Movies for the Blind' is spilled all over this project. Don't believe me? Check out tracks # 2. 5. 6. 9. 11. 12. 14, that's over half the entire record ! The rest of it sounds like the good parts of 'DFM', not the experimental hit or miss tracks, but the dark bangers that you've grown to expect from this dude. The way Cage paints a picture for insane and often relateable situations in day to day life doesn't make him emo it makes him real. The production sounds a little more minimal than his work with El-P on Def Jux, but those not familiar or have forgotten about Dj Mighty Mi, this is more tuned to his music style. Don't count Cage out, for every 4 years or so he drops a very solid hip-hop record, and 'Kill the Architect' is certainly one deserved of being appreciated.Check out my review for Cage Depart From Me back in 2009 : http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IR2R05SH803V/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B0029ZUQ8K&nodeID;=5174&store;=music"
A3JCD7RQXJYUOX,B00F0MX866,4.0,Kill the Architect is the latest project from Cage and some of my favorite stuff he's ever done. Is this Movies for the Blind or Hell's Winter? No. Is this a bad thing? No. Cage has always been sick and his willingness to progress as an artist needs acceptance from no one. This is a top 5 album of the year.
A2263F1WASP2PG,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"I have to say I was hesitant in ordering this CD because the last Christmas one that I bought a couple of years ago just was not very good (at least in my opinion).  It was recorded in a cathedral and the acoustics must not have been very good.  The music was just too loud for Susan's voice and I felt she was drowned out.  Not so with this CD!  Susan's beautiful voice is superb on this CD, the music is beautiful, and the arrangements are great.  I was a bit taken back by the \"duet\" with Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis (more by Elvis than Mathis).  This seems like a bit of a ploy to me get listeners but I do have to say that the mixing of that song (O come all ye faithful) is flawless and Mathis' \"duet\" is done with the song \"When a child is born\" which is one of my favorites.  I really do like The Little Drummer Boy rendition with its strong bass.  I also like the clear vocal tones on \"Bleak Mid-Winter).  So, I am really glad that I decided to get this.  It reminds me of the joy I felt when I bought her first CD after her initial discovery and meteor rise on the Internet."
A6TYHY7LOFTNW,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"This another very good set from Susan Boyle. I liked the selection of songs. Her voice is still quite simply amazing. I didn't really care for the duet w/Elvis -it wasn't bad just not up to the rest of the CD.My only two complaints (and they are both very minor) are I would have liked to have had 2 or 3 more songs - the CD would have easily have accommodated them. The second is I think the music was about 1 or 2 notches too loud on some of the songs almost covering up her wonderful voice.I liked the new song 'Miracle Hymn' from soon to be released movie, 'The Christmas Candle'. Susan will be making her movie debut in this movie which is to be released on November 22. Her voice was so very clear sounding that it was simply amazing.I never really liked 'In the Bleak Midwinter' but Susan's A cappella version is enough to make me reconsider my opinion. Her voice is so pure an youthful that it was simply stunning.My favorites were 'The Christmas Waltz', 'The Little Drummer Boy, I'll be Home for Christmas' and 'Have Yourself a Very Merry Chrustmas'. The 'Lords Prayer' was also very good.Her duet with Johnny Mathis on 'When a Child is Born' was a nice touch.I would rate this a very strong 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5. Highly recommended for lovers of Christmas music or Susan's great voice."
A2GYJM3VC0H6BX,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"Susan Boyle never disappoints me.  She has a beautiful voice, and these seasonal songs are a joy to hear.  I look forward to her next album."
AGA8PQ1CDVPYB,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"I remember Susan Boyle's entrance on television with her powerful singing voice that had Simon Cowell gasping with wonder! She awed us all with her handling of the music, her control, and her range. This cd has Susan taking on Christmas music, and she does it very well. You enjoy carols? This cd is for you!"
ANIWBLLIGJRFQ,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"Susan's voice just keeps getting better and better. So crystal clear and expressive. Beautiful songs from a beautiful, talented, gracious and humble lady. The duet with Johnny Mathis, \"When a Child is Born\", is much more than just sublime. It brought tears to my eyes the minute Susan started singing the opening phrase. All the songs are beautiful. There's a sweetness to Susan's voice in these songs. It's a little different than her previous CD's. The whole album has a very festive feel, lighthearted and uplifting. It's  what we have come to expect from Susan Boyle, the lady with the most beautiful and versatile voice I have ever heard. She is simply magnificent as a singer and as person."
A25LDUTTB4K0A9,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice.  On this CD she sings Christmas songs alone or duets with some well known male singers, even Elvis!"
A2F5KIAJEFV792,B00F0O8SZK,2.0,"I love Susan. A truly mellow and smooth voice. Bit, as is mostly Christmas albums, they seem to think they can make 500 year old music sound better than it already is. Just give up and sing the perfect songs and let us rejoice in them. Don't pick too many obscure tracks either.  Better luck next time."
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"This is Susan's second Christmas album and maintains the standard of the first. It contains mostly songs that her fans will be familiar with, and which are always popular at Christmas time. I love those songs, but because I listen to a lot of Christmas music, I like to see at least something different. The last three tracks cater for that desire, being The Christmas waltz (an old song from the thirties or forties that is rarely recorded these days, although it's not that difficult to find on collections of Christmas oldies), In the bleak midwinter (also not that difficult to find, but not among the most-recorded Christmas songs either) and for the climax, Miracle hymn, which I've never heard before and might be an original song, though I'm not sure if it is.Another feature of the album is Susan's duets with Elvis Presley (on O come all ye faithful) and Johnny Mathis (on When a child is born). Personally, I think they would have sounded better as solo tracks, though they work quite well as they are. The original recordings by the two men are fantastic. There is at least one comparable precedent for Elvis's voice being posthumously overdubbed, in the album Christmas Duets. As I said in my review of that album, I enjoyed it but still preferred the original Elvis recordings, even though I'm a fan of some of the singers who contributed their voices. So it is here - the duets sound great, but duets work better if the two singers are in the studio singing together. Johnny Mathis recorded his parts for \"When a child is born\" in America, while Susan recorded her parts in Scotland.Despite my minor quibble over the duets, this is a fine album that should please Susan's fans."
A1H16VPL9XKGGR,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,"I'm a big fan of Susan Boyle, and when I saw that she put out a Christmas album , I just had to have it."
A3694Q0RYPIIW3,B00F0O8SZK,5.0,Susan Boyle is great at anything she sings.
A2SR4GHSL5CDWA,B00F0S6UX8,2.0,"&#34;Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&#34;: four words, four lies. Three songs that ten people stayed and listened to during the closing credits is not a soundtrack. The real soundtrack can be found as the &#34;Original Motion Picture Score&#34;."
A1CIY288AAWI0O,B00F193D5Y,4.0,I was able to see EC at the Long Beach Arena where some of this was recorded. Its nice to listen to that concert again. On disc one there is an unfinished cut of Please be with me. It was disappointing.  I am a completist so I purchased this. This box set is for collectors like me
A3HNTTBLZS3L1O,B00F1CRRIU,2.0,"I've liked Arcade Fire since Funeral. This release is difficult to describe. One thing to note is that it has a large electronic component, so much so that it does not sound like the same band to me. Being electronic isn't not necessarily a bad thing, but as a potential buyer, you should be aware that it is a significant departure from their previous work. I actually applaud bands for pushing their boundaries. There are some interesting moments here, but as a whole, I'm having a hard time following this one. That being said, some of the albums I disliked at first eventually became some of my favorites. Music that is very different from what you're used to, if it's really good, can end up changing you. To me, that is the sign of a really powerful work. I will keep listening and if it grows on me, I'll update the review accordingly. I will say that it is a little better than I thought the first few times I listened to it. But this one is work."
A115BN0E2T0KR5,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"This is another great album from Arcade Fire, they have a different sound, but still that same clever song-writing and social commentary. I think this is another contender for Album of the Year for sure."
A26YIS31VHWSAL,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"She loves Arcade Fire, and to tell the truth, I really loved the CD when I heard it too. Great band"
A392UU5LJ9X09A,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"This is my first CD of this music group. I don't often purchase todays music. Most of it isn't worth my money. This one was. I really like what they put out. I listen to it often. I'm not a person that can \"critique\" music (or books), I just know what I like and I like this."
A2LSWBBCLW87LW,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"I wouldn't say I'm an Arcade Fire fanatic, but even the most casual listener can appreciate the band's rich, methodical approach to music. Needless to say, these guys knock it right out of the park for the fourth time. Reflektor is about as distant from The Suburbs as you can imagine, but it's a lot stronger for it, and they pull it off without forgetting who they are and what they're about. Amazing record."
A338CGS4RJPE5,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,For a long while I was a very mild AF fan who liked some of the hits and more popular songs they had put out. I knew they were coming out with a new album and was not too excited about it and didn't listen to it for weeks until after it's release.It wasn't until my sister's boyfriend ordered me to sit down and really listen to the album. I did and I thought it was an OK release and only liked a few of the tracks.For a couple of days after that I kept thinking of some of the songs I listened to and how strange and unique they were. I finally decided I would sit down and listen through it all again. I really liked it! I listened to it again and loved it! I've now been listening to this album and all of their other previous releases whenever I have free time.This is now one of my all time favorite albums and I even like it more than AF's Neon Bible (Just barely) and Funeral. If you listened to this album ONCE and didn't enjoy it I am begging you to listen to it again! I admit I'm not a fan of Super symmetry though.
A1R3VM07705OQP,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"Wow...whole new sound from AF.  This is their best album, from the jarring intro \"Reflektor\", to the more traditional AC fare like \"We Exist\", to the disco-noir of \"Joan of Arc\", to the melancholy \"Porno\", this is sonic brilliance on a whole new level from Arcade Fire.  I have yet to listen to the new Pearl Jam album all the way through and I\"ve played Reflektor about 40 times now.  Its Arcade Fire's \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\""
A1WZT7UP4XAO5G,B00F1CRRIU,4.0,Very good album.  Different than their earlier work but still as compelling.  Most songs are strong although a couple fall flat.  Overall a great listen.
AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00F1CRRIU,4.0,"Reflektor, is many things to my newbie ears, this being my first AF cd- many of them enjoyable.  I first came to know them from their contribution to the Hunger Games soundtrack, Abraham's Daughter, which was one of the best tracks on the cd.  The first thing that struck me about Reflektor was all the lyrical imagery and references to not only the classic Orpheus myth but the film Black Orpheus as well.  I won't bog you down with the details of the tale, but treat yourself to a quick refresh to help frame the context of the songs.  Even if you don't, the album remains quite enjoyable.The entire album keeps a seventies-ish, riding-the-cusp-of-disco avant-garde groove to it and the ever-present reverb and other assorted dissonant sounds mixed in are kind of like how Portishead used to do.  Reflektor brought to mind classic efforts from bands like The Clash, Norman Greenbaum and even the Beatles among others.Some highlights:The title track, Reflektor, is fun to listen to, if a little long- built off a steady beat and bassline you can easily get with.Flashbulb Eyes- a little surfer-style rhythm guitar, snare drums, some FX... but all I can really say is you're gonna love the old skool reggae bass running through this one.Here Comes the Nighttime- an absolute slice of Black Orpheus here.  Its ska-styled bass and keyboard bottom, filtering, xylophone, and isolated guitar riff absolutely evoke images of strutting down the street during carnival somewhere, especially when the tempo shifts- the bassline carries the whole thing.  Awesome.Normal Person- off to a fun start with some nightclub dialogue before switching to a true classic style; bass, rhythm guitar and drum with some piano included.  And the the lyrics were fun.  All told it not only reminded me of David Bowie in his prime but kinda White Stripe-y as well.Joan Of Arc- very Norman Greenbaum-ish here, and not just for the quasi-religious overtones of the lyrics.  There's a definite Spirit in the Sky thing going on here.Here Comes the Nighttime 2- any song that incorporates them old Dolby Digital tones used at the start and end of cassette tapes is alright with me!  The lyric structure and synth arrangement here are eerily reminiscent of the Beatles' A Day In The Life.  Check it out and see if you agree.It's Never Over (Oh, Orpheus)- slowly builds up from airy synth into a bass/bottom rhythm, soon followed by a great drum/guitar combo.  The lyrics are wholly derived from the Orpheus myth (...just wait until it's over/wait until it's through... no turning 'round too soon).  And that's a nice pulse beat bridge dropped in before coming back to the instruments.Supersymmetry- wholly a keyboard composition, the half-whispered lyrics of the duet strikes yet another chord, this time the Rolling Stone's Emotional Rescue.  Even the chorus is done in a similar vein.You might think I'm calling this album derivative, but I'm not.  I rather enjoyed the trip down memory lane it provided- intentionally or not.  Even if they've consciously drawn references from other groups, as they did with the Greek myth, I'm not complaining.  It all made for a good listen and brought a new fan."
A29PN9KFTZLF5Q,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,I so enjoy this whole album. I have listened to it a dozen times and still love it. Check this out folks.
A2BNPGBPZX8YBV,B00F1CRRIU,5.0,"Like approximately 3 billion other people, I really liked their previous albums, and i was honestly a bit disappointed with this one on the first listen, and even on the second and third. But at some point -- somewhere around the 4th time through It's Never Over/Hey Orpheus,I thought this is actually a pretty great album. The songs tend to run a litter longer than I might like, but there is really a lot going on in this album. It might actually be their best album, but I think I need a few more listens to really start to get a good sense of it."
A3VXCK9IDMEVY5,B00F2HW1S0,5.0,"They Put It All Together This Time. Only 1 Or 2 Duds, But For The Most Part A Great Chunk Of Rock Music That Melts In Your Brain Like Butter. Plus Vinnie Rules The Kit."
A2GDVLYQDG0SWW,B00F2HW1S0,5.0,This record is a great followup to their debut album.  Good straight ahead rock music.  I would recommend this one.
ABZZZNYSJMJVC,B00F2HW1S0,4.0,"It's rocking.  Along the lines of Corrosion of Conformity meets Alice in Chains.  Vinnie Appice as usual does a spectacular job of pummeling the drums.  It's not plowing any really new ground, but the ground that it plows has been effectively rocked."
A32UXNH9QF000P,B00F2HW1YY,5.0,"It took me awhile to warm up to the Flower Kings. I thought there was too much instrumental doodling and that the songs themselves were weak. I have changed my mind with the release of their last two records! Strong song structures. Killer Guitar!!! I mean is there anybody who solos like this guy.... Their style IS a bit quirky, but it's prog isn't it!"
A14YWSO7DF1GWT,B00F2HW220,5.0,He is a master of music.  Fantastic CD in the style of Ayreon.  If you like his older material you will love this materialTony
AQ969QPG7OS78,B00F2HW220,5.0,"Love all of Arjen's music. Always great melodies, both lyrically and musically, with many talented musicians and vocalists. Buy it, you'll love it !!!!"
AL765DE4VV2SF,B00F2HW220,3.0,Interesting attempt at Prog/concept album.  Parts of it are outstanding but otherwise too repetitive.  One good CD would have sufficed.  Good effort though.
A1DE2YZFPI0URS,B00F2HW220,3.0,"Let's face it - this is a rehash of Tommy, only the music isn't as interesting. Not the best concept or music from Ayreon."
AG5XM49AZVIYH,B00F2HW2B6,3.0,"I've been a fan of Warbringer ever since frontman John Kevill took a dive off the stage right onto my face when the band was opening for Exodus in 2009. That performance (which induced such a furious moshpit that a friend of mine was swept right off the front barricade and sent flailing to the back of the venue) inspired me to buyWar Without End, and I enjoyed it so thoroughly that I have continued to buy Warbringer albums as fast as the band can pop them out. Each new record, for me, has been better than the last. Until now.When Warbringer released the track \"Hunter-Seeker\" in September I got extremely excited for Empires Collapse. The song has everything I have come to love about Warbringer: heavy riffs, a blistering pace, demented solos, chilling lyrical content, and a confident delivery. It screams (sometimes literally) Empires Collapse is going to be \"a [expletive] Warbringer record!\" (to quote Kevill).So when Empires showed up at my door and I greedily tore the package open to release the thrash within I was expecting a masterpiece. Even just looking at the case, the artwork, and the rest of the packaging, I felt like I was holding something special. From the first sound of the haunting intro to \"Horizon\" I was blown away. Soon Kevill is screaming, the guitars pick up speed, and then a murderous riff explodes. Violence ensues. Chaos reigns supreme. Children die.Ok, so I'm exaggerating; nobody dies. But you surely get the point, good reader: the opening track is just as sinister and gut-wrenching as \"Hunter-Seeker,\" or anything else in Warbringer's catalogue for that matter. The second song, \"The Turning of the Gears,\" is not as fast or cruel as \"Horizon,\" but it is nonetheless an outstanding track. As Kevill yells about the inanity of life the listener is assaulted by a series of intentionally repetitive and ultra-catchy riffs that serve the lyrical content beautifully.Just as I'm about to declare Empires Collapse the metal record of the year, \"One Dimension\" comes on... What's with the sissy riff? Why is it so groovy? What inspired such weak lyrics? WHERE DID WARBRINGER GO?!As I continued through the album, I encountered similar problems elsewhere. \"Black Sun, Black Moon\" is a mediocre thrasher with a catchy chorus, \"Dying Light\" is a fairly standard track reminsicent of Slayer, and \"Off With Their Heads!\" is not long enough to offer much of interest (it clocks in at 1:37), though if I was an executioner for a Russian Czar I'd probably get pumped up to it every morning while I ate my meager ration of rotten potatoes. The real downer, though, is \"Iron City.\" Like \"One Dimension,\" its riffs are uncharacteristically simple and groovy, and its lyrics are downright awful (case in point: \"we're gonna play it loud and drink some [expletive] beer!\"). In short, \"Iron City\" is completely out of place on a record about the destruction of empires and should have been a b-side so it could be properly appreciated for what it is. Instead, it very awkwardly nestles itself between two of the darker tracks on the album.Fortunately, there are a number of excellent moments if not excellent songs on Empires Collapse. A solid effort overall, \"Scars Remain\" also has an awesome riff late in the song; \"Leviathan\" is a crushing track and surely the slowest, most methodic song Warbringer has ever written. \"Towers of the Serpent\" is a speedy thrasher that appropriately gets very melodic (in a good way) to close the album.All in all, Kevill was right. Empires Collapse is still a [expletive] Warbringer record. It just isn't as good of one as some of the band's previous efforts. Fans of the band will like a lot of what they hear but will be scratching their heads about other tracks. Even so, the album is worth buying for \"Horizon\" and \"Hunter-Seeker\" alone. Hopefully, the departure of guitarist Adam Carroll is not the reason for the slight decrease in the quality of Warbringer material; the fact that Cruz, the drummer, wrote \"Hunter-Seeker\" is enough to keep me hopeful for future releases. I am also still hopeful that Empires Collapse will grow on me.SPECIAL EDITION EXTRASWhile I don't like all the material on the record, I do appreciate the band including a bonus DVD. When bands are willing to put a little extra material on the album, I'm willing to pay a little extra for it. The Empires Collapse DVD includes three things: a short \"making of\" about the album (4:36 in length, so it's really just a taste), a twenty minute documentary about Warbringer's European tour (which includes live footage and other random stuff of varying value), and an hour-long live show of the band playing a venue in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the sound quality of this concert isn't that great, but it's still worth watching. The set for the show includes all of Warbringer's first album War Without End and is as follows:Living WeaponSevered RealityTotal WarSystematic GenocideDread CommandHell on EarthAt the Crack of DoomBeneath the WavesInstruments of TortureShoot to KillBorn of the RuinsCombat ShockLiving in a WhirlwindTreacherous TongueWith over two hours of material on Empires Collapse, it is pretty hard to argue that Warbringer isn't giving us fans a good deal on the record."
A1UFAX5NZE35XI,B00F2HW2B6,4.0,"I have to say I am pretty impressed with their new effort. When I first saw the cover art it really turned me away for some reason, seemed really out of place so I avoided it for awhile, then I heard Hunter-Seeker and played that song quite a few times and enjoyed it quite a bit (still do!) then I heard the album had leaked and I searched YouTube for a few tracks and it seemed decent but I never bought it or anything until a few days ago and it just arrived and I just had one first full listen thru and it is a damn good album on my first impression, sure some songs are stronger than others on the outset but I really believe this one is an album that will grow on you with time and I am glad I made the purchase. Standout tracks would be Hunter-Seeker, One Dimension, Scars Remain, Dying Light and Towers of the Serpent but as I said they are all really solid."
A2STAX43T698G5,B00F2HW3JW,5.0,"Like my review title says, this album is my first exposure to Protest the Hero (PTH). I bought this album blindly because it showed up in my recommendations, and I'm ecstatic that I did. This is by far the greatest musical impulse buy I've ever made. I've been listening to this record nonstop for a week, and it continues to blow me away.To start off, I like all kinds of metal, but I mostly listen to metalcore. Also, I'm a sucker for originality. I love anything that's fresh and unique (An ironic statement coming from a metalcore fan, I know). It's like August Burns Red and Periphery got together and had a baby that's better than both of them. It's amazing. This album is exactly what I love. It's original, well thought-out, technical, fast, and polished.A couple of major things that set it apart from other metal are as follows:Musicianship: I've listened to a lot of music, but nothing else can quite captivate me like the instruments in this album. The guitar playing in this album is breathtaking. Each song is a shredfest of tasty licks, and I could listen all day to just the guitars. As a guitar player, I immediately appreciated the creativity and intricacy of the riffs and licks in this album. The rhythm section also knows what they're doing. Every instrument drives it's own part to create an advanced onslaught that can entrance the listener. There's nothing I can say that will quite capture the level of musicianship in this album, it's best to just go listen to it.Song Structure: Something I noticed right off the bat was the lack of &#34;traditional&#34; song structure. Most metalcore (with the exception of August Burns Red and Parkway Drive) is full of the same verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus song structure. This is something that annoys me personally, because it makes the music predictable. Metal should never be a predictable genre. PTH seems to have taken this to heart, and they've basically thrown traditional song structure out the window with this album. Each song is like a series of parts and riffs that were strung together. Normally this would sound choppy, but PTH has managed to smooth it out and make each song coherent and flowing. Their transitions of riffs and time signatures is spectacular, and it keeps the listener captivated throughout the song. Songs never get boring or repetitive because you only hear each part 1-2 times at most. This is probably one of the biggest pluses for me on this album. Well done Protest.The Vocals: Rody's voice is unlike anything I've heard before in the metal scene. The only two bands that come close to the style of vocals are Affiance and Periphery. I personally love his voice. Normally I'd prefer more screams in my music, but his voice is too good for me to wish that. His voice is strong, clear, and used very well. He has a great voice, and unlike most singers in the genre, he knows how to use it!!  He wields his voice with precision, and hits some crazy good notes throughout the album. Again, there's no good way to describe his vocals. You'll just have to listen to them.And finally, THE LYRICS: One of my major gripes against music is the lack of conviction, purpose, and sincerity behind the lyrical content. I'm here to tell you that PTH does a very good job of crafting lyrical masterpieces that show their passion and drive as musicians. The lyrics aren't simply a means of letting the singer use his voice, but they add immense value to the album. If you need proof, just look up the lyrics of Plato's Tripartite. It's very sobering song that delves into problems with the justice system in relation to rape. The lyrics speak volumes on this album. Unlike the thousands of songs about &#34;be yourself&#34; and &#34;you're perfect how you are&#34; and &#34;breakup&#34; songs (that metalcore is infamous for), this album is full of deep, provocative, and purposeful lyrics. I really appreciate this as a music listener.In conclusion, this is one of the best metal albums I've ever heard. Everything about it stands out from others. I highly recommend it for any metal/metalcore fan."
A1UU5IWKD5TMYI,B00F2TIJW0,5.0,"A fairly straight-ahead formula--each song often starting with a slight accent of keyboards that at times one hardly notices, like a neutrally painted floorboard which supports the brightly painted walls that are the collision of feed backed guitars swirling in a closed room or on a ride in outer space. Such a collision of sound is penetrated weakly by suppressed vocals, REM-style. It's as if someone told Jim Morrison to put a sock in it or he was forced to sing with his vocals clipped. All of this occurs in a constant battle with the crashing splashing drum thwack, Moe Tucker-style. It's a compelling, if not a predictable conflict that has its roots in the Velvet Underground, Neil Young's crunchier moments, and Yo La Tengo's best LP, I\" Can Hear the Heart Beating as One.\" Every now and then a tambourine slides in and in conjunction with the steady heartbeat reminds you that yes, you're free to dance. Guitar solos, when they occur, clock in around 10-20 notes, max. After seeing them live I now know that the synthesizer provides as much sound as Johnson's guitar. The psychedelic movie projection light show was a nice synthesis to the rumble of sound."
A14YZVQTMRO7NE,B00F3AC5PA,4.0,"That's the number of songs I rated five stars. The others were four star ratings, which makes this one of my highest rated discs (album, playlist, etc.). It's an excellent Christmas album with the songs being sung by today's artist."
A3GYKZ8B96895A,B00F3AC5PA,5.0,"As I sit here and listen to this soundtrack, I am really impressed by the beauty of it. I am particularly fond of \" As \" by Anthony Hamilton and Marsha Ambrosius. This song was beautiful when written by Stevie Wonder, yet this treatment by Anthony and Marsha brings out the magic in the lyrics. It is a pure masterpiece, this version will go into history as a classic love song .  And my second favorite is \" Shelter\" by John Legend, what a song, another classic love song. The soundtrack over all is really good, this is one where you can not go wrong. All I can say is Wow!!"
A1TK047CF6W00J,B00F3AC6BS,5.0,Pearl Jam if you haven't listened this is the one. It was needed in my lost music category now it's filled.
A1ZZEUGRKGZWHV,B00F3TD8HU,4.0,As usual there's always one or two songs missing from a compilation or greatest hits. This one does not include &#34;That's Why I'm Here&#34; from the album of the same name. All in all this CD details his best songs.
AWAPUW6QPD0AF,B00F3VOL38,5.0,"These recordings were done at a time when America couldn't get enough of the Fab Four. I was in 8th grade when The Beatles played Ed Sullivan; my musical frontiers were forever changed, and this offering brings back all the freshness of those four young brilliant musicians... good stuff! The liner notes and packaging are an excellent compliment to these spontaneous live versions, some of which were not recorded in the studio."
A2GI5BUHLZMCYK,B00F3VOL38,4.0,"Fine, more previously unreleased stuff, all good.  The real issue is, why is this the only new Beatles release we are getting for this holiday season.  Specifically, where are the re-issues on vinyl of the original albums in mono?  It was bad enough that we didn't get them last year when the stereo ones were re-issued on vinyl, but I thought for use we'd then get the monos on vinyl this year.  I suggest all Beatles fans agree to boycott all Beatles related releases including this one and McCartney's new solo album until we get the following:  1)  The first 8 albums in mono, on vinyl, mastered in pure analog from the original tapes.  2)  The last three albums in stereo, on vinyl mastered in pure analog for the original tapes.  3) Forget this Past Masters and MMT album crap, we need a box with all the 7\" singles and e.p.'s on vinyl."
A2PJBX24OT9534,B00F3VOL38,4.0,"Because The Beatles were releasing 2 albums of music for nearly every year of their career, there aren't any legendary lost recordings, such as The Beach Boys \"Smile\" or Dylan's \"Basement Tapes\" (the three anthology albums I think prove this).  So the \"Live at the BBC\" albums are as close as Beatle fans are going to get to own a fab four version of a \"Odds & Sods\" records (you could count the \"Let it Be\" sessions I suppose, but that was just the band running through all the 1950's songs they used to perform before they got a record contract).So if you have the first Volume of BBC recording, you will know what to expect here, there are no \"Why didn't they ever release this song!\" moments, but a fascinating musical & social time capsule (although there are four interviews recorded at the time of the release of  \"Rubber Soul\" & \"Revolver\", which sound from a different era).Highlights for me are Chuck Berry's \"Memphis..\", tracks from \"Beatles for Sale\" (always been my favourite of their mop-top albums), & John trying to create the feed back at the start of  \"I feel fine\".So if you're a fan of The Beatles early recording, want to complete your Beatle Back-catalogue, or just want to buy a Beatle album when it was first released (this sounds like it may be the last), then it defiantly worth having."
A2OHV3KA7GMXAQ,B00F3VOL38,5.0,"I love these four guys and all they did, so I am totally happy with this CD from The BBC."
A3OOPRYGY7XG06,B00F3VOL38,4.0,"Like the first volume, it's fun. The verbal banter is silly but they were asked to respond to some pretty stupid questions over and over again. That being said, the music is solid and the covers are done well. If you like their later stuff, you might want to listen to it before buying it."
A16B6YNV4G7TVC,B00F3VOL38,3.0,"Not as much 'new' material as the Vol 1.  Most are songs you have heard before, but they are very well done, and there are excellent interviews of the lads at the end."
AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B00F3VOL38,5.0,"Imagine and close your eyes and hear John, Paul, George, and Ringo begin the first disc of The Beatles  &#8216;On Air &#8211; Live at the BBC Volume 2&#8217; with banter &#8220;And Here We Are Again,&#8221; which will take listeners back to a time of innocence not only for the members of the band but a generation and generations thereafter and on a rock and roll ride that no one during the existence of the band would last for over 50 years!  But The Beatles and their fans and everyone that continues to listen to their music proved the critics wrong.  &#8216;On Air&#8217; is merely a sample of the band&#8217;s music, raw and as live as they can be when they are let loose on the stage in front of hundreds of screaming teenagers or in front of a sound board at the BBC studios performing their hits and album tracks and few surprises of covers from their idols from Chuck Berry to the Everly Brothers unabashed and somewhat sounding improvised and spontaneous.This beautifully designed CD is Volume 2 and contains two discs and a nicely packaged and well-detailed book of liner notes that is contained within the inner sleeve.  For listeners that are just beginning to delve into the live sounds of The Beatles, indeed, this is a treat as it was for the first volume; although several tracks are repeated on this set from the first, they are alternate takes and re-mastered but one may have to listen very carefully to identify the difference.  Nevertheless, what makes this release enticing to listen to is the sheer pleasure of listening to the live versions of the &#8220;hits,&#8221; &#8220;I Saw Her Standing There,&#8221; &#8220;She Loves You,&#8221; &#8220;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&#8221; &#8220;Twist and Shout,&#8221; and &#8220;Please Please Me.&#8221;  No matter how many times one listens to these songs, they never wear the listener out.  In addition to the familiar songs, there are the gems of cover songs that the band played during their early set lists at the Cavern Club and in Hamburg that shows how diverse their interest in musical taste expanded, &#8220;The Hippy Hippy Shake,&#8221; &#8220;I Got a Woman,&#8221; &#8220;Beautiful Dreamer,&#8221; and even &#8220;Happy Birthday.&#8221;  Another part about the CD is the interviews of the members of the band, which are the bonus tracks at the end of disc one and two, that shows once again, the bright, fresh-faced, innocent, and living in the moment personalities that John, Paul, George, and Ringo possessed before Beatlemania and at the height &#8211; 1962 to 1965.The Beatles tend to have a knack of capturing every fan&#8217;s heart when it comes to their music.  And for fans and listeners alike, no matter how many times one listens to &#8220;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&#8221; studio version, the Ed Sullivan Show performances, or the live version on this CD, it is the sound that began it all for the band &#8211; absolutely fabulous or for The Beatles FAB and timeless."
A3HP2B888ZWQYI,B00F3VOL38,5.0,"As The Beatles were just starting to get large in Britain, they recorded for The BBC.  I put off buying this CD for a few months, as several of these songs are on their first Live At The BBC album.  Glad I bought this one.  These versions are different, done at different times.  Here, you can listen to The Beatles as they sounded as a club band, just as they were beginning to record for Parlaphone.  Their BBC recordings were done virtually live.  So, when you read &#34;They really weren't that good, they couldn't sing or play that well because no one could hear them anyway,&#34; don't believe it.  This is what they sounded like.  I was fortunate enough to see them live in Houston in 1965.  The sound mix was awful [vocals through the auditorium PA system]. But, believe me, I could hear them singing and playing through the amazing roar of the screams.  Yes, they could play!  Although how, through the sonic shrieks of the screams, and without the abilities of amplifiers feeding their sound to the stage, is still amazing to me.  But, this CD is great, and should be bought by all Beatle fans.  BTW, the interviews at the end of the CD's are quite interesting looks at the boys in 1965-66 (actually after the songs on the CD's were recorded)."
A1QDH9VQXH2JGV,B00F3VOL38,2.0,Love the Beatles. I guess I'm too critical about audio so I'm going to have to give this a &#34;spend your money on something better&#34; rating.
A1VY2CG81I1JRR,B00F3VOL38,4.0,"What I came away with was this feeling that, while it's full of fine performances and definitely a recommended addition to a Beatles collection, it honestly wasn't quite as interesting or necessary for me as Vol 1, given that the other collection had the superior selection. It is worth mentioning that \"Lend Me Your Comb\" is included here where it belongs (not Anthology 1) and \"Beautiful Dreamer\" is also great to have.  Unfortunately, we are denied 'A Picture of You', 'Besame Mucho' and 'Dream Baby', all of which are from 1962 and feature Pete Best's last recordings with the band (it may have been a legal complication).I must say I think the biggest and best surprises, other than the cool pictures in the book, are the interviews at the end of each disc.  If you have 10 minutes to interview each Beatle, Brian Matthews did them right.  No trivial petty questions about \"your type of girl\", these are revealing and serious interviews, especially for their length.  For me, these are the gems."
A2T7JK9FLC8V0N,B00F3VOL38,5.0,"Nearly twenty years since the first Beatles at the BBC album comes Volume 2, nicely packaged in a double CD digi pack with a 46 page booklet. In my opinion it was worth buying the actual CD rather than downloading the music simply for the informative booklet, with an introduction by Paul, all the track details and lots of photographs. I know you can download it on your ipod, but the actual paper version is easier to read and ideal to peruse while you sit down and enjoy this great collection.It is a slight shame that we don't get to hear the fun openings for shows, such as 'Pop Go the Beatles', which the band recorded specially. However, these CD's are packed with really good quality tracks and interview snippets as the Beatles read out cards and generally cause mayhem in the studio. George reads out a very strange card about the Flowerpot Men (Bill and Ben, not flower power just yet), Paul is asked about his 21st birthday party (not quite the success he suggests, as all fans know!), Ringo calls John a \"College Puddin'\" and both John and Paul are heard laughing at George when they are asked about writing the songs for \"A Hard Days Night,\" among lots of other interview clips. Most of the songs are excellent quality and they include lots of early hits as well as great cover versions, showing how versatile the Beatles were and giving you an idea of the set list they would have played live in Liverpool and Hamburg. The poorest audio is heard on John singing Chuck Berry's, \"I'm talking about you,\" which was presumably worth including because of its rarity. There are lots of early tracks on here which the Beatles never recorded and they give you an excellent flavour of the band in those early days. Lastly, there are four bonus interviews, approx 8 minutes, for each member of the group. Once you have listened to, and loved, this, then (if you haven't already) go and read the wonderful new biography of the early days of the band,Tune In: The Beatles: All These Years: 1, to recreate those heady days when success was just arriving and they were obviously still enjoying themselves hugely."
A3H7DVRC2QLH6S,B00F3VOL38,4.0,"Wait, let me explain. I do like the Beatles and own a few CDs, entirely post-Revolver. I have other opinions about the Beatles but just to suffice to say, I'm not a Beatlemaniac. So I hope this review is taken as an honest one from a casual fan.However, I stumbled upon this at a certain big-box retail store with a price that was too good to believe. (I'll leave out the details to protect the innocent.) Plus, I have no early Beatles in my collection, and this looked like it could be fun.And it is. The intro snippets are funny and fun to listen to. The BBC interviews, recorded a year or two later than these sessions, are actually quite intelligent and insightful. Recorded while the band were recording Revolver, the interviewer avoids teeny bopper questions like &#34;What's your favorite color?&#34; and asks interesting questions that receive interesting answers.The performances themselves are tight and exciting, to say the least. Some are straight to air, some are live in studio, and some have been overdubbed with dual track vocals, or hand claps and such. What strikes me about the performances is that is proves that the Beatles were a great live act at the time. That they gave up live performance for &#34;art&#34; is kind of sad, although we are all glad that they made that decision in the end. But they were really, really good live! When you could hear them above the screaming. While The Rolling Stones adhered to one style, honing and improving it with each effort, The Beatles all but ditched their early sound and went it a totally different direction. And that is what makes them brilliant. They mastered and defined the &#34;beat group&#34; sound, then left it behind to master and define an entirely different sound. But I have to repeat this - they were a really really really good live band during this period.If you are a Beatle-maniac, you'll buy this anyway. If not, and you can get it at a good price, go ahead and give it a go. You won't be disappointed."
A24JGWQAA84MT2,B00F3VOL38,5.0,Just an added bonus to the BBC recordings. If you enjoyed the first set then you willjust add to your enjoyment with Volume 2.
A7B1JHN0BLM0F,B00F429ZB4,2.0,"The lady has a nice voice.  She needs much better, interesting, and evocative songs.  Maybe next album.  After getting through one listening I am retiring the CD."
AB2FM5W8LOIL9,B00F429ZQO,5.0,Rarely do I actually like all the songs on a cd from start to finish. You can tell they worked hard on every song and it pays off. I love the addition of industrial sound. Lyrics are meaningful and executed in original ways. I highly recommend this cd I honestly can't stop listening to it.
A2YP0HP7ZEZA27,B00F429ZQO,4.0,Nine Lashes last album had a more aggressive sound than this album.  This album is sure to produce a great deal of radio singles and as a fan I still recommend purchasing the album.  I appreciate the band trying a little different sound without over-reaching but I do prefer their last album.  If you purchase this album and like it then you will love their last album.  Enjoy!
A1NBGPOX9X4A04,B00F469KLA,2.0,"I can't understand the reviewers who think this is their best, I love Leaves' Eyes and I have from the beginning, and I love all their music, but this is clearly their weakest music ever. None of the songs are especially memorable as were all the songs from their older cds. I would have given it 2 stars but just because I still like them anyway, I just couldn't. I am really disappointed because I had been looking forward to their new release, now I'm glad I didn't order it, because I wouldn't keep this and I would never listen to it again"
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00F4YS4VE,5.0,"Ever since Snoop Doggy Dogg (as he was known at the time) emerged in the mid 1990's,he was musically on the forefront of a group of hip-hoppers who were intent on basing their music and thematic concepts on the slicker end of George Clinton's P-Funk sound,which was referred to as G-Funk. This end of the \"gangsta\" rap spectrum tended to provide an interesting contrast to some of the more controversially violent lyrical content,which is a staple of maintain hip-hop (still hard for me to use those two adjectives together) even today. Apparently during his 2011 concert Snoop was joined onstage by Dam Funk,a West Coast artist who is continuing to expand the 80's boogie funk style that wasn't wholly represented in the early/mid 80's and which had an enormous influence on the G-Funk sound Snoop and his contemporaries originally pioneered. Since his early days Snoop has of course grown as both an artist and a human being. And considering his collaborations with P-Funk's iconic bassist Bootsy Collins in different settings,his collaboration here with Dam Funk is an important arc  of Snoop Dogg's (presented himself here as Snoopzilla in tribute to Bootsy) long and interesting career.All of the eight pieces on this album,which include a bonus track in \"Systematic\" are all proudly fashioned by Dam Funk without any samples and all with the use of analog based electronic/synthesized instrumentation. \"Hit Da Pavement\" features Bootsy,ever being himself on a thick and grinding groove that also blends in some of Dam Funk's moodily melodic synthesizer atmospherics-which of course permeates this entire album. As always Snoop himself alternates between rapping and singing in his funky and slurred vocal style song the chanted choruses on songs such as \"Faded Away\",\"Let It Go\" and \"Do My Thang\". \"1Question\" brings in Slave's Steve Arrington,another artist whose worked with Dam Funk for a number that actually heavily recalls some of Slave's mid 80's styled funk. \"Ride\" showcases a rhythmically percussive early drum machine based groove. The actual album,taking the hard grooving bonus number aside,concludes with \"I'll Be There For You\",a very spare and almost minimal Afro pop/jazz styled funk groove that has a strong UK jazz/funk flavor about it.Now this is not a long album,at under 35 minutes. On the other hand its extremely successful at what it set out to do. With the focus still very much on Snoop's rapping,this actually is still very much a G-Funk hip-hop album. What helps it stand out is that the verse/chorus structure is more in tune with the way funk is structured in terms of songwriting,which was common as hip-hop was beginning to commercially break through while funk was still (in some form anyway) more the musical mainstream. Well,in terms of the black community anyway. This spells out that what Snoop and Dam Funk are looking to do is create a new year zero for the \"new funk\" sound that has been re-emerging in the last few years or so. The lyrics to some of the songs elude to the fact that rappers,the majority of whom in Snoops generation anyway always wanted to make full on funk music,are now in a possition to get their chance to do so,and without necessarily having to make any concessions to the hip-hop that actually still defines this album. While not precisely a full on funk album in the 70's/early 80's sense of the word,this accomplishes much by taking the somewhat stunted new direction of 90's G-funk,mixing it with the \"new boogie\" funk sound to create a whole new future for the music."
A4QLU72T91JG7,B00F4YS4VE,5.0,"I was so upset that I almost cried because of this album. Not because it isn't good, because it's great. The reason is this: this album should be selling by the boatload and being played everywhere on West Coast radio and nightclubs all over. Newsflash, it isn't. Every record on this album bangs, as Dam-Funk brings his own twist on the funk we grew up on. Snoop sounds in prime form on this album, as funk has always been his strong suit. Knowing that, I have no idea why he does that other junk and doesn't stick to the G-Funk flavor that made him a superstar 20 years ago.My favorite songs off this album would be &#34;Hit Da Pavement&#34;, &#34;Faden Away&#34;, and &#34;Do Your Thang&#34;. They are especially funky. This is what music in this era should be, not that techno junk that plagues mainstream radio. Support great music and buy this album!"
A1S6RQ6T479ZEC,B00F5HWC54,4.0,"In this day and age of cherry-picking songs off of iTunes, listening for free off of You Tube, and self-made playlists, there seems to be little need for an officially-released compilation album. However, I am very pleased that The Killers have gone the traditional route and compiled all their best songs into a single new release.Like many other reviewers, I already have all The Killers' albums, so the only new material I'm getting is tracks 14 - 17. And yet I don't consider my money wasted, because I do think it's important to support your favorite artists financially. Not only is it just the right thing to do, but it enables them to continue making great music. Secondly, listening to this whole disc all the way through serves as a reminder of what a great band The Killers really are. Certainly one of the best bands of the new century.The \"Mr. Brightside\" demo and the \"When You Were Young\" remix are really the only tracks I don't care for. As one reviewer stated already, the \"Mr. Brightside\" demo is only mildly different from the album version, and the \"When You Were Young\" remix, like many remixes, is superfluous.The new song \"Shot At The Night\" is fantastic, more proof that The Killers almost can't make a bad song.All in all, whether you've been a dedicated fan since their first album, or if you're just getting into The Killers, I would say this album is worth your money."
A384ODJB85EGS5,B00F5HWC54,5.0,"Maybe I'm biased because I love The Killers, but I was so glad when they released this because I love their songs, but this CD is awesome, even for the more casual Killers fan."
A1W92Q0DMJLNO9,B00F5T5B0U,5.0,I am a huge TLC fan and had to have this album!!! Great songs from the past and the new song 'Meant To Be' is amazing!!!!
A1LG11VGFDAFY,B00F5T5B0U,5.0,"TLC is one of the best girl groups of all time and I'm so glad that they have returned with some new material after being dormant for the past several years. This greatest hits album was compiled from the hit singles that made them famous and the fan favorites that everyone loves. Even though not every TLC gem is on here, it's still a great compilation and after I watched their VH1 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, I realized that the track listing was put together by drawing inspiration from the movie and I bet that there was a lot of close attention that was paid to compiling the track list, because they had to make sure that they included the songs that appeared in the film and songs that correspond to certain events that occurred in the film (i.e. Pebbles wanting to change the group's look to be more feminine corresponds to the message in \"Hat 2 Da Back\" and the devastation that T-Boz and Chilli suffered when they learned that Left Eye died corresponds to the message in \"Damaged\"). You see? So even though there are some missing tracks, it's not a total disappointment. Plus, there's also a new song on here entitled \"Meant to Be\". It's great and has a great message to it, declaring that even though TLC has been through some rough times in the past, they know that it was \"meant to be\" that they would overcome their obstacles and need each other for success. All in all, its a great compilation and if you love TLC, you will want to add this to your collection!!! I know I have. :)"
A3AB4DLKEWA7FN,B00F5T5B0U,5.0,"I was young in my early 20's in the early 90's when TLC (T-Boz, Left-Eye and Chilli) EXPLODED into the music scene and changed it forever.  I lived thru every song, every lyric .. If I was all alone in an island, with my choice of one CD to keep, THIS IS THE ONE!!!  TLC FOREVER!!! ...Can't wait to see the movie. LOVE my girls!!!!"
A3NHY1XCJZQT8G,B00F5T5B0U,3.0,"Great songs but all of these are on Now & Forever: The Hits with the exception of Meant To Be. All the songs are still edited on this collection as well, both in length and words. I figured they would have at least tried to get the rights to put \"Crooked Smile\" with J. Cole on here since that was a recent hit, but I knew that was a long shot with that being his song.TLC is awesome but you'd be better off spending your money on Now & Forever: The Hits by them, unless that goes out of print in favor of this which would be a real shame. The track selection is exactly the same as this minus Meant To Be, but you get 6 more songs instead of just 1 new one on here.This collection almost ignores that 3D exists, it contains Damaged, but doesn't have the main hit Girl Talk and leaves off Hands Up yet again. Other songs missing that could've been thrown on...I'm Good At Being Bad from FanMail, which I guess wasn't an official single but it was popular enough to chart without any official release or Come Get Some from Now & Forever since it was also a single. Maybe even some rare b-sides, I mean there's enough space for it. It just seems like they missed the mark by taking off 6 songs in favor of one new one and nothing more.I hate to say it because I think TLC is great, but this seems like a money grab to coincide with the CrazySexyCool movie that was just released. This could have and should have been a 2-Disc set with most/all the songs from Now & Forever plus rare b-sides and remixes for fans who already have most or all of their previous recordings. Also, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLICIT VERSION. TLC is music for adults and should be treated that way. I hope you can find a copy of Now & Forever because it beats this collection hands down. Better yet, just buy all of their albums. There are only 4 and they're all worth it."
A3OOMA2BICA6DE,B00F5T5B0U,5.0,I have been a TLC fan fron day one! When they stepped on the scene with &#34;Aint Too Proud To Beg&#34; I was SOLD for the rest of their career! They are multi-talented and the best Gurl group ever in my opinion! Nothing like the music of the 90's and this CD takes me back down memory lane. LOVE IT!!! And their new single &#34;Meant To Be&#34; written by Ne-Yo is a great addition to their many hits!
A1U0QFWM1ONURK,B00F5T5B0U,5.0,This is simply a great CD. I've big a big TLC fan from the beginning and this collection of all their hits is a great pick-up for anyone who isn't very familiar with them.
A366K0NZ5LQIUC,B00F6Y3C4Q,5.0,Restless Heart has made a very good Christmas Cd and every track is so good that I can't quit listening to it.  Fans of Restless Heart will like this and anybody that likes upbeat and a few Ballads for it being country music. And contains 2 Orginal tracks from them they are &#34;Old Toy Trains&#34; and &#34;Santa's Prayer&#34; and A  acapella Verision of Silent Night.
A3CPA0XGKNY9ZJ,B00F6Y3C4Q,5.0,"You can't keep Larry Stewart, Paul Gregg, Dave Innis, Greg Jennings and John Dittrich from being restless for long.  Though there were periods of hiatuses, detours and breakups, after 30 years, Restless Heart is still together and going strong.  Eight years after their last album of new material &#34;Still Restless,&#34; they are back with their first ever Christmas album conveniently titled &#34;A Restless Heart Christmas.&#34;  And they are also headlining an extensive tour in celebration of their 30th Anniversary.  What the Eagles is to pop music is what Restless Heart is to country music.  Over the period of 1986 to 1988, they have placed unblemished and unprecedented seven back to back number one hits starting with &#34;That Rock Won't Roll&#34; to &#34;A Tender Lie.&#34;  Unlike other of their peers, Restless Heart was able to cross-pollinate into the Adult Contemporary chart with great triumph when their 1992 single &#34;When She Cries&#34; became a pop radio staple.  To this date, their song &#34;Mending Fences&#34; is still one of those once-in-a-lifetime revelation set to music gems about reconciliation.  Their tightly knitted harmonies have sired a mishpocha of similar groups within country groups such as Rascal Flatts, Zac Brown Band and Lonestar.Long term fan will not be flummoxed by the sound of &#34;A Restless Heart Christmas.&#34; Never bludgeoned to submit to the derivative sounds of today's lacklustre style of music, &#34;A Restless Heart Christmas&#34; is rifled with their patented harmonies and those melodious Eagles-like guitar driven country that have first brought them to the dance.  Helmed by group member Greg Jennings, this festive set is book ended with two originals and eight seasonal trust-worthies.  Let's start first with the newbies:  serviced already to radio as the lead single is the Aaron Boswell, Steve and Connie Tittle's &#34;Santa's Prayer.&#34;  Often Santa's CV has been freighted with frivolous activities such as taking photos with screaming kids and whispering empty promises into the ears of children, &#34;Santa's Prayer&#34; definitely adds a deeper spiritual dimension to Santa's job description.  Frustrated by the commercialism of Christmas, &#34;Santa's Prayer&#34; finds the man with the red bag on his knees praying to God: &#34;I'm just a pawn but you were born a King/Sure they're gonna love the gifts I bring/But the greatest gift they ever will receive is the love that's bringing Santa to his knees/be reminded of that star so bright, let it shine down/ let the world see me as a second thought to the one that guides old Santa when he's lost.&#34;The other new track is album opener &#34;Season of Harmony&#34; penned by Wayne Kirkpatrick, Chris Harris and Mark Heimermann.  Piercing through the frosty cold of December, the preppy &#34;Season of Harmony&#34; reminds us that what warms Christmas is not a higher electric bill but family and loved ones.  Maybe it's because of the homely ambiance that &#34;Tennessee Christmas&#34; creates, it, has almost become an expected Christmas cover for many country artists recording a Christmas effort these days.  Restless Heart's version, though it is not spectacular, brings out a beauty that is hard not to put the track on repeat.  A little more obscure is Roger Miller's 1967 &#34;Old Toy Trains;&#34;  &#34;Old Toy Trains&#34; is essentially a children's lullaby magically transformed by Restless Heart into a future country classic with its old fashioned but delightful steel and fiddle underpinnings.  Dubbed as their Take 6 moment, with all instruments kept in abeyance, &#34;Silent Nights&#34; gets a stunning acapella treatment from the quintet.&#34;Angels We Have Heard on High&#34; and &#34;Jingle Bell Rock&#34; sound more Restless Heart than your average Christmas offering.  If you love Larry Stewart's soaring vocals on their previous favorites such as &#34;I'll Be Loving You,&#34; &#34;The Bluest Eyes in Texas&#34; and &#34;Fast Movin' Train&#34; you will absolutely adore how they have treated these carols with their 70s styled guitar driven pop-country.  Thirty years may have passed, and while many of their peers have had called it a day, Restless Heart is still sounding as fresh and as engaging as in their commercial heyday.  If you love Restless Heart or Christmas music, you will not be disappointed with &#34;A Restless Heart Christmas.&#34;"
AGEJE3WH26UBR,B00F6Y3FKW,4.0,"I'm not here to review Dylan (does anybody REALLY need to?).  The audio is fabulous, as the box supplies the '03, '05 & '09 remasters, along with 14 additional newly re-vamped titles, so from an audiophile standpoint, it's the ***t.  However, I'd still give this set a 4-3/4 star rating, the missing 1/4-star due to a couple of weird decisions regarding content and construction.When I was reviewing the tracklist for the \"Side Tracks\" set, something was tugging at my memory, until finally it dawned on me: On \"Biograph\", there were 18 unreleased tracks: 17 of them are on the ST set, which you would think would more or less obsolete Biograph in our collections.  However, the '97 remastered Biograph was processed with Sony's Super Bit Mapping, and some of the same tracks on ST don't sound quite as good.  So, don't part with your Biograph set just yet (and Dylan's per-song recollections in the Biograph booklet are pretty kewl).The other CACV1 decision that threw me for a loop was the inclusion of the original mix of Street Legal.  That mix sounded terrible on its original vinyl and CD.  However, when Sony unexpectedly popped up with a fabulous new Street Legal remix/remaster in the 2003 SACD hybrid Dylan releases, it was truly a revelation.  I was never sure what Dylan was trying to accomplish on that album, but I always liked it.  Not including that version in this set is really an injustice, because once you have compared the two, the original becomes unlistenable.The last thing: Sony has been parading out these great catalog box sets for the last few years.  The one negative constant that runs thru them all, however, are the cheap album sleeve cover replicas.  What makes this especially annoying for long time Japan mini-sleeve collectors, like myself, is that mini-sleeves are 135MM-square, where the sleeves for Sony's domestic box sets are 125MM.  The difference? A mini-sleeve CD slides easily out of it's cardboard album jacket, but getting the discs out of these smaller sleeves without getting your fingerprints on the data side is a challenge... with practice, you can do it, but it ain't easy, these smaller sleeves are just too tight around the disc.What's frustrating is: ALL of the 135MM mini-sleeve-sized print-ready artwork masters for ALL of these titles already exist at Sony Japan, because almost all of these box set titles have previously been released as mini-sleeves over the past 20 years... Why not just get that art and print properly-sized sleeves where you don't have to fight to remove a disc?  I've never understood that.  Even more maddeningly: Sony DID use 135MM sleeves in the U.S. Mono Box!All in all, these are minor nits, and this is truly an awesome set."

A2LK1Y762WCWSW,B00F6Y3FKW,5.0,"There is not much to dislike about the complete studio albums, 14 remastered, plus live CDs and a bonus 2 CDs. I have all of this already except \"Christmas in the Heart\" and \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\", but it's scattered across CD's, LPs, tapes, DVDs, Laserdiscs and every format they came out with. Now it's all in one box, one place. Don't even think of buying this set from anyone but Amazon.com. They have the best price.Here's an appreciation of Bob Dylan by the decades.The 60sThe 60s gave us the first 9 albums of Bob Dylan&iexcl;s career: \"Bob Dylan\", \"The Freewheelin&iexcl; Bob Dylan\", \"The Times They Are A-Changin\", \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\",  \"Bringing It All Back Home\", \"Highway 61 Revisited\", \"Blonde on Blonde\", \"John Wesley Harding\", and \"Nashville Skyline.\"I have to admit that&iexcl;s a pretty impressive body of work for a young singer who bounced out of the Midwest into New York City in 1961.Within those 9 albums Dylan paid homage to blues, folk, re-wrote the protest song, re-wrote rock and roll as a literate form of music, moved us into the night world of Blonde on Blonde, through the mysticism of Woodstock and plunked us firmly in Nashville USA.  Dylan played the background music for the best years of our lives, a friend said last night. We can't go back but we can listen and jam the songs with friends.The 70sHappily or otherwise married for half the 1970s, Dylan started one of the most controversial but productive periods of his career.Among the 13 albums, there are stellar albums here like the incomparable \"Blood on the Tracks\", \"Slow Train Coming\", \"The Basement Tapes\" (OK it&iexcl;s 60s material), \"Hard Rain\", and \"New Morning.\"The rest of the 70s are all over the map for Dylan. We just finished shelling out for \"Another Self Portrait\" so that one isn&iexcl;t like to get much play but it&iexcl;s part of the oeuvre. I can&iexcl;t get some of those songs out of my head like &iexcl;Belle Isle.&iexcl;Of course, any of us mere mortals would be happy to have produced just one, anyone of Dylan&iexcl;s 70&iexcl;&auml;s albums.Who owns \"Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid?\" No one but now you can with one of Dylan&iexcl;s two most famous songs C &iexcl;Knockin&iexcl; on Heavens Door.&iexcl; Just for laughs watch Kris Kristofferson grin his way though a shoot clip out on YouTube. Columbia got even with Dylan by issuing out-takes on \"Dylan\". The Asylum albums \"Planet Waves\" and \"Before The Flood\"  prove you don&iexcl;t get far dumping old friends, even over money.\"Desire\", \"Street-Legal\", \"At Bukodan\" (OMG those outfits and backup singers!) C you gotta have them to be a completist.The 80sThe taped voice-over to Dylan&iexcl;s Never Ending Tour says he hit rock bottom in the 1980s but he still produced some awesome, timeless material.He started the decade with Jesus and \"Saved\" and ended with \"Oh Mercy\" his first classic collaboration with Canadian Daniel Lanois.Top albums, if I may be allowed a bit of critical thinking, include \"Infidels\", \"Real Live\", and \"Shot of Love.\"Even the lesser of the albums have Dylan gems like &iexcl;Emotionally Yours&iexcl; and &iexcl;When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky&iexcl; from \"Empire Burlesque\",  &iexcl;Brownsville Girl&iexcl; from \"Knocked Out Loaded\", &iexcl;Ninety Miles an Hour Down A Dead End Street&iexcl; from \"Down in the Groove.\"\"Dylan and The Dead (Live)\" is a total mystery to me. Some people like it, some don&iexcl;t.  Most people admit it was the bottom for Dylan. Still 9 CD&iexcl;s when you are at your career ebb, that&iexcl;s impressive.The 90s and BeyondThe last 2 decades have been Dylan&iexcl;s most productive since the 60s.Let me go out on a limb C there&iexcl;s not a bad album among the 10 of them.OK I refused to buy \"Christmas in the Heart\" but still love to watch the &iexcl;Must Be Christmas&iexcl; video. If fact I watched it twice last night.\"Under The Red Sky\" is an album that Dylan produced for his last child but the songs are amazingly adult. &iexcl;Wiggle Wiggle&iexcl; and &iexcl;Born in Time&iexcl; are two of the classics. Dylan loves to play a driven blues version of &iexcl;Cats in the Well&iexcl; during his concerts.\"Good as I&iexcl;ve Been to You\" and \"World Gone Wrong\" have Dylan revisiting folk music starting another wave of interest in \"roots music.\" These 2 CDs are excellent and Dylan is in top guitar playing form.\"MTV Unplugged\" highlights classic Dylan material in a great setting. Buy the DVD if you can. It's worth repeated viewings.Dylan and Daniel Lanois team up again for the Grammy winning \"Time Out of Mind\" with its world-weary view of an older man. &iexcl;Love Sick&iexcl;, &iexcl;Not Dark Yet&iexcl; and the Adele hit &iexcl;Make You Feel My Love&iexcl; are some of the gems of \"Time Out of Mind.\"The trilogy of \"Love and Theft\", \"Modern Times\" and \"Together Through Life\" C all good C take us to last year&iexcl;s \"Tempest\". All 4 show Dylan is still a creative powerful artist. I did not appreciate \"Tempest\" when it came out but I'm coming around on that one. Of course, who does not like \"Duquesne Whistle\" ?"
A3997BXDT2224G,B00F6Y3IWC,1.0,This one didn't work for me. You would have thought the coming together of these artist was a hit but I just didn't care for this album.
A3DU0W2AW1ZQ4V,B00F6Y3IWC,5.0,I loved the soundtrack of this movie and purchased it the same evening.  Love Jennifer Hudson and was wowed by the rest of the cast.  Who knew Forrest Whittaker could sing?
AVV5LM79EG8LT,B00F6Y3IWC,5.0,"I absolutely love the soundtrack to the movie Black Nativity.  Not only are there songs by some of my favorite singers Jennifer Hudson, Mary J Blige and Tyrese on the album, but Angela Bassett and Forrest Whitaker also have a few songs on the soundtrack.  Listening to the soundtrack has me excited to see the movie."
A1MBKW5DA9YLU3,B00F8F6DVM,5.0,I was totally melded to the sounds when i listened on my High-End System. WOW ! Mind -Encasing is the word. Not to be listened to on DEPARTMENT STORE GRADE sound systems.
A1EFIBVOTRG1SB,B00F8JZE22,2.0,"I loved Reanimated and especially enjoyed Living Things.Recharged, after two listens, is just not very good.While my initial reactions often change, I don't think I'll bother going back for further listens on this album. I'm not even sure how to describe it. I don't mind that each track has a dub step feel to it, it just sounds just so predictable and boring."
A1AHI8CUE3OQI4,B00F8KIJ2I,4.0,"I see a lot of people saying \"best album in awhile.\" That's because this is the best album in awhile. Or ever. I guess it is clear by now that Lavigne is never going to surrender the teenybopper affectations that seemed cute at 17--less so, now. But what she does well is create toe tapping music, straight-ahead rock 'n' roll that gets your energy level up, while at the same time adding often clever lyrics. The combo of catchy tunes, lots of energy and often funny lyrics is hard to resist, and sometimes there is something elegant and softer--Hush, Hush now. I can forgive the eccentricity here and there, the sometimes juvenile motifs that keep getting repeated. This is a lot of fun, with some terrific songs like Rock N Roll, 17, Here's to Never Growing Up, Hush Hush, Falling Fast, Give You What You Like, and others. It's a strong album from start to finish. About the only thing I disliked was the rather bizarre Hello Kitty. It hasn't been this good since the days of \"Complicated\" and \"Girlfriend.\" Sometimes I feel guilty for liking Lavigne--an artist who never quite seems to grow up. (Well, there's a song there, I guess. ) Then, I remember why I liked her in the first place. It's just plain fun and she's really good at what she does, which lets her get away with things others with less talent couldn't."
A2PJ0XLO1WHU7C,B00F8KIJ2I,5.0,Amazing! Avril has grown as artist as a songwriter and as a person and as a new style icon! Avril doesn't take chances musically as well as her new style! She doesn't follow trends. She starts them! She's not afraid to just put herself out there and always does with incredible confidence! Anyone can either like her or hate her but her fearless confidence makes her unique and that's what makes her avril! It's who she always been and always will be! Go avril!
A26WUEKYKQA361,B00F8KIJUK,5.0,Very nice Christmas CD. I love the arrangements and the way Tamar interpreted the songs. I enjoyed listening to the purity of her voice. And the duet with her sister Trina.
A3A58E0Y0P4MTF,B00F8KIJUK,3.0,I liked her other music so I thought her Christmas CD would be just as nice.  I don't dislike it but it was just ok with me.
A3O9MAQZPS8YDE,B00F8KIJUK,5.0,Tamar is just getting another chance to showcase her talents hopefully she stays. Everyone within the sound of my voice please support Tamar she is a diamond in the ruff. She is very talented.
A1650I94SH53EH,B00F8OUBXE,5.0,"LET ME START OFF BY SAYING METAL CHURCH RELEASED THEIR SELF TITLED ALBUM \"METAL CHURCH\" IN 1985 AND THEIR FOLLOW-UP \"THE DARK\" IN 1986. BOTH OF THESE ALBUMS ARE ICONIC MUSIC FROM THE METAL UNDERWORLD OF OLD AND WERE THE ONLY TWO METAL CHURCH ALBUMS (IN MY OPINION!) THAT WERE TOP NOTCH \"OLD SCHOOL\" HEAVY METAL. THE NEW ALBUM \"GENERATION NOTHING\" SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN 1987/88 AS THE FOLLOW-UP FROM \"THE DARK\" AS IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS DID. THE SINGER RONNY MUNROE SINGS IN THE STYLE OF DAVID WAYNE \"GOD REST HIS SOUL\" AND THAT IS A DAMN GOOD THING! SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT MOST OF US OLD SCHOOL FANS OF METAL CHURCH WANTED. IT BRINGS BACK THE SOUND THAT MADE THESE GUYS RECOGNIZABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE, FOR EXAMPLE: HOW QUEENSRYCHE'S NEW SINGER TODD LA TORRE SINGS IN THE STYLE OF JEFF TATE AND ROB DUKES OF EXODUS SOUNDS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN PAUL BALOFF AND STEVE SOUZA, OR TIM \"RIPPER\" OWENS REPLACING ROB HALFORD. THESE REPLACEMENT VOCALIST'S ONLY MIMIC THE SOUNDS OF EARLIER VOCALIST'S THAT MAY HAVE MADE A BAND MORE SUCCESSFUL OR POPULAR IN THE PAST, BUT THEY ALSO BRING THEIR OWN STYLE INTO IT AS WELL AND \"IT WORKS!\". THAT IS WHAT MADE US FANS OF A PARTICULAR BAND IN THE FIRST PLACE! AND LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE MUSIC ITSELF ON THIS ALBUM!!! MY GOD, THE WAY IT IS CONSTRUCTED AND PLAYED IS ALL IN THE SAME DIMENSION AND FORM FROM THE BANDS ROOTS....THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! THAT IS WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE A FOLLOW-UP ALBUM FROM A RECORD 20 OR 30 YEARS AGO, BUT I LOVE IT! AND MOST OF YOU DO TO. THE NEW ALBUM IS FANTASTIC AND IS IN \"TRUE\" METAL CHURCH FORM! I CANNOT WAIT FOR A FOLLOW-UP OF THIS NEW ALBUM....METAL CHURCH IS BACK!!!"
A2YSI8AJCOEQBS,B00F8OUBXE,5.0,"Best metal album in 2013. I was hesitant to buy it but then I was caught when I started playing it.  This is a true continuation of The Dark album back in 1986.  I also enjoyed Blessing in Disguise from 1989 and Human Factor in 1991, although not quite the same original sound as earlier works.  Generation Nothing goes back to where MC origins.Lot of good songs and hard to pick one as favorite.  Tunes as &#34;Suiciety&#34; and &#34;Scream&#34; are very good, &#34;Generation Nothing&#34; and &#34;Media Horse&#34; are also outstanding.  This is a fine work from MC.Highly recommended."
A2KT3DANHRTI38,B00F8OUBXE,4.0,"Really good album. Listened to this band back in high school. I saw that they had a new cd, and decided to give it a try. There are some cheesy lyrics on here, that make you scratch your head, but overall, very impressive album. There is some great, catchy guitar grooves in this album. I give it a thumbs up!"
A1J7LKMZG3ZVLU,B00F9PUSRQ,4.0,"It's a Good Night for Singing has always been my favorite Jerry Jeff album.  It got me through my yearly moves all over the country - first thing up was the stereo and this album went on it.  It got me through the usual - and not so usual - ups, downs, falls, etc of my 20s and 30s.  I still think it is the best overall album he ever did.Contrary to Ordinary is not as great, though it has a few decent cuts.  Wish I had the option to buy Good Night for Singing without it (I'd give Good Night for Singing a solid 5 stars), but it's still great to have this double album available."
AKEYQJAAQ3XCL,B00F9PUSRQ,5.0,"Well, it only took about twenty-five years, but all of Jerry Jeff Walkers 1970's albums have finally been issued on compact disc!!! I can rest much easier now! If you already own &#34;Jerry Jeff Walker...Plus&#34; and &#34;Walkers Collectibles/Ridin' High...Plus&#34; with this edition you now have six of Jerry Jeff's albums, with &#34;A Man Must Carry On&#34; split up between each of these releases. With this variation of &#34;A Man Must Carry On&#34; you get all of the music minus the poetry and the &#34;Stereo Chickens&#34;. Personally, that's okay with me. Listening to &#34;Stereo Chickens&#34; is like listening to &#34;Revolution 9&#34; by The Beatles. Once is enough.Though the two albums here were recorded only about two years apart, they are two very different albums, each recorded with a different backing band. &#34;It's A Good Night For Singin'&#34; was recorded in Nashville with the Lost Gonzo Band and the help of a few Nashville studio musicians. Decidedly the more country flavored of the two. This is one of those rare albums that has no filler! You can play this album through from the first song to the last without having to skip over any! Any one of these songs should have been a hit. In fact, there were at least three songs released as singles, though they never made any impact on top 40 radio. They should have!&#34;Contrary To Ordinary&#34; was the first full album to feature Jerry Jeff's newly assembled band after The Lost Gonzo Band left to go it on their own. And a great band this was, too! I personally think that, technically, the new Bandito Band was a tighter band, equally as good, if not better than The Lost Gonzo Band. But, I think that they lacked the charisma of the Lost Gonzo's. Like I said, that's just my opinion, they are both great!In 1979 Jerry Jeff would go on to release an album titled &#34;Too Old To Change&#34; that included a song titled &#34;Too Old To Change&#34;. Then, true to his &#34;Contrary&#34; nature, he changed!! His next studio albums released in the early '80's would be &#34;Reunion&#34; and &#34;Cowjazz&#34;. Both good albums, but lacking the same 'punch' of his '70's albums. Showcasing his more 'mature' approach to music and life. Can't blame him for that! From all that I've read about the man, it's a wonder that he even survived the '70's.So, hopefully within the next year or so, we can expect to see those two albums released by Raven.Okay, I could go on and on, but I've got some music listenin' to do! I'm gettin' way behind too!!"
A3OYW2LNO8D62X,B00F9PUTRU,5.0,"Wonderful record. Wish I coulda gotten the disc and not just the download (out of stock, postage way too expensive), but I converted it to wav and cdr. Sounds &#34;fine&#34; but a little muddy, not much high-end compared to their last 3 or so CDs. I used the same method on those, too. I'd imagine it's a pro tools issue. Drums get lost. Hard time understanding the narrator w/ no libretto.... but that's digital/tech. Sad Johnson is gone, but I believe he sings on a track or 2....don't have the credits. This is a wonderful record. Don't like to end on a negative, but the Amazon Cloud player thingamajig is silly and stupid. Don't need 90 players on this thing....The downloader works fine....it's about music, not the damn player/adverts....Acer's Clear-fi is the best player I've come across since '94...."
A3QL3186KULMBB,B00FA1DEXY,5.0,Simply overwhelmed with this album....  I'm so glad the blogosphere sent me here.  I will be riding high on teen angst for weeks.
A13HAJYO0FO0LQ,B00FA1DG82,5.0,"I have to agree with other reviewers on the quality of this package, although one reviewer has it totally wrong -  this is NOT an Eric Records release. It's an entirely different company - 'Complete 60s'.  The sound quality of this new release is really amazing to borrow a word from the title. That's not surprising as I was equally happy with the same company's earlier series of \"Complete Instrumental Hits of The Sixties\" which also appeared as 3 CD sets.While I have all of these songs on other compilations, the attention to detail that the producers of this set have given to the inclusions is exceptional. It's obvious they have done their research well in making their selections for this release. To hear familiar songs such as Gene Pitney's \"Town Without Pity\", Brian Hyland's \"Sealed With A Kiss\" and Sam Cooke's \"Wonderful World\" in stereo for the first time, is a real treat. I am not generally a fan of artificially created stereo, however the DCS conversion of Wanda Jackson's legendary \"Let's Have A Party\" to stereo is very well done, with good separation, but without that awful echoey fake stereo that different record companies gave us back in the 70s for other songs from this same era.I'm also pleased to see the producers have given us the correct HIT versions of these songs, including Ray Peterson's \"Corrina Corrina\", Buzz Clifford's \"Baby Sittin' Boogie\" and Tony Orlando's \"Bless You\". These are all the original mono single versions - the commonly reissued stereo versions of those songs on other compilations feature alternate vocals. In the case of Adam Wade's top 10 hit \"As If I Didn't Know\", all previous CD reissues of that song have used a stereo remake which made it's first appearance on a Greatest Hits album on Epic label in 1963 after Wade had switched to that company. Finally, the 1961 hit version for Coed Records makes it's worldwide CD debut on this set.Includes a detailed booklet with stories on all the artists and their songs. Even if you have a lot of these songs on other CDs, they won't sound as good as they do here. Highly recommended."
AL80L19INIU9I,B00FA1DG82,4.0,"I would readily admit that the sound on  &#34; Eric &#34; label releases is generally superior to other labels  ,  and that is the case with this  3-CD set.  However , in my opinion . the use of the descriptive term  &#34; hard-to-find &#34;  is misleading  ,  because the vast majority of the 88 tracks are quite easy to locate on other compilations  ,  albeit not in such pristine sound.  There are a few outstanding rarities  , such as Bertha Tillman's  &#34; Oh , My Angel &#34;  and Aki Aleong's  &#34; Trade Winds , Trade Winds &#34; , but  these are out-numbered by dire oddities such as  &#34; Dutchman's Gold &#34;  , &#34; Hot Rod Lincoln &#34; , &#34; Marina &#34; , &#34;  Who Stole The Keeshka ?  &#34; , and , in particular , a truly abysmal so-called &#34; comedy &#34; record called &#34; Cinderella &#34; , by Jack Ross.  In conclusion , I would point out that I have many &#34; Eric &#34; CDs in my collection , but I am disappointed by this one.  Although it provides a very welcome opportunity to obtain familiar songs in great sound  ,  I feel that some purchasers may be disappointed by the relatively few tracks which are genuinely  &#34; hard-to-find &#34;."
A18S9EZ36MI062,B00FA1DG82,5.0,"This is one great CD collection. The Sound Quality is second to none. First we have the Stereo debuts of \"A Town Without Pity\", \"Venus In Blue Jeans\", \"Let The Little Girl Dance\" and \"Sealed With A Kiss\". These songs have never sounded better. Crystal clear and plenty of bass. We also get the Rare Stereo version of \"Wonderful World\" by the late great Sam Cooke. Then there's the Stereo Debut of Wanda Jackson's, \"Let's Have A Party\". Not Elvis but interesting. Then there's the Single Stereo Debut of Jimmy Jones, \"Good Timin'.How about Walter Brennan's Rare \"Dutchman's Gold\"? A truly great song. I had never heard Paul Evan's \"Happy-Go-Lucky-Me\" but I like this song! Then there's the Stereo Debut of Johnny Bond's \"Hot Rod Lincoln\". This is a great car song and very enjoyable. When I first saw Anita Bryant's 3 songs I cringed. Anita Bryant? After one listen, I am a fan. This lady can truly sing! Her style is similar to Connie Francis. Speaking of Connie, her song \"Together\" is here. This is my favorite Connie song. Clarity and bass here.Now we get to Steve Lawrence And Eydie Gorme. I have a bootleg of \"Portrait Of My Love\" but this CD song far out shines that. This song sounds great. So does \"Go Away Little Girl\". Ace has this song on one of their collections but in my opinion, this one sounds better. Unfortunately we lost Eydie a few months ago but her music lives on and \"Blame It On The Bossa Nova\" sounds terrific! We finally get the Stereo version of Paul Anka's \"Story Of My Love\". Paul always put out great songs and this is no exception. By the way, he wrote most of his material.For those of you who are into Mono, there is Ray Charles' \"Unchain My Heart\". It Makes it's Mono Hit Single Debut here. Comedy has it's place here also. Who can ever forget Lonnie Donegan's \"Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It's Flavor\"? The rare Stereo version is here and is very clear and enjoyable. Finally we get the Stereo debut of the Contours' \"Do You Love Me\". I have the Rhino Mono version and this sound is much better.Well there you have it. A truly great collection. Yes, a number of these songs are available elsewhere but how many CD's would you have to purchase? Everything is right here in this great 3 CD package. At 10 bucks a CD you just can't go wrong. By the way, before I forget, A special thanks to Greg Adams for his 10,000 word Liner Notes and also to Bill Buster and Randy Price for producing this and a very special thanks to Mark Mathews and Walt Weiskopf for the Sound reproduction. A job well done. Highly Recommended!"
A3UQM3J20IXW89,B00FA1DG82,5.0,"I already had 55 of the songs on cd in this massive collection.  Yes, I am a collector of music from the birth of rock and roll....especially the pre-Beatle era.  My favorite musical year, in total, is 1961.  This year, to me, resonates as the most prolific in rock and roll history for memorable songs.Suffice to say, I am ecstatic with this collection.  The main thing here, is the marvelous remastering of these tracks...crystal clear with crisp highs and strong bass presence(when it means something).The notes included in this box are detailed, interesting and extremely informative.If you are a collector, or just curious about why collectors love this stuff, do yourself a favor and have a listen to some magnificent music from \"the soundtrack of your life\"."
A1K4WELEWXBP60,B00FA29FDQ,5.0,Erica Campbell solo CD is wonderful.  I purchased the CD based on the tracks Help and I need a little more Jesus but the entire CD is worth the purchase.  Great Job Erica.
A6AC58IO2W7CW,B00FA29FDQ,5.0,"awesome, awesome , awesome.  just what my soul needed !!!  help is what we all at some time in our lives have had to scream out, in voice or in spirit !"
A1HDELFTVZMFFZ,B00FA29FDQ,5.0,THIS CD IS VERY UPLIFTING. I CHOSE THIS CD BECAUSE I LIKE THE MARY MARY CD. IF YOU LIKE GOSPEL MUSIC YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD. THE SONGS ON THIS CD TOUCH YOUR HEART AND BRIGHTON YOUR DAY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR PURCHASE.
A1W3G8E9V2NFXO,B00FA5S4NA,5.0,It is a really great album...better than the first three albums...daughtry has outdone himself this time. It's a good time.
A3CD81HCTHFNS,B00FA5S4NA,5.0,"THIS IS GREAT ALBUM THAT YOU REALLY WILL ENJOY, IT'S A COMBINATION OF ROCK BALLADS, IT REALLY WORK FOR ME. ENJOY IT!"
A1H8PY3QHMQQA0,B00FA5S4NA,4.0,"Not sure why everyone is giving this album a poor rating. I have all of Daughtry's stuff. This is a little bit softer than most of his other albums, but come on his an artist and just wants to explore other things. I liked it, and I have everything from Acid rock to country."
A2IMKLI6X18E9Q,B00FA5S4NA,2.0,"The album was a good idea, but needed strong songs to justify the change in style. The songwriting is weak and the great idea is lost on this one."
A3P7MAJUH5HS6W,B00FA5S4NA,3.0,Just picked up the new daughtry cd and its not as good as his other cds. I really like his rock songs but this is all pop.
A4Z9NHOW5LT0M,B00FA5S4NA,2.0,"At first, just watching the album cover I knew this wouldn't be a rocking album. After hearing the first song, I was impressed to see how he has spread his musical horizons and gone experimenting other stuff but...that experimentation went completely driven in this album. As a whole, this album is a acoustical/synthesizer album, hardly electric guitars and really hardly will you hear Daughtry singing like he has done in the prior albums.This is a Pop album and this is what happens when artists want to try new things, they forget their roots and what got them to fame and delve in other musical genres that are not really suited for them. Daughtry is not the first and will certainly not be the last.If you want to be in a passive mode, then this album will certainly fit you. Be advised, if you've liked his prior albums with that edginess and rock oriented bass, then this album will not fit that mold."
A1JW1VKFDNNFWO,B00FA5S4NA,2.0,"Daughtry's other 3 albums have been at least kind of rockin'.  After hearing all the hype about stretching the boundaries of music and how great this new album was gonna be, I pre-ordered Baptized.  All I can say is I expected a rock album and what I hear is music more suited for Air Supply.  If you like acoustic oriented bubblegum pop music, then you are gonna LOVE this.  I hope it grows on me, that is if I can force myself to listen to it again. lol  Everyone else may like this change to very dance/pop music, but it's just not for me and most of the songs even sound the same.  I know all the Daughtry fans will be throwing hate my way, but i'm a Daughtry fan also.  I have all the cd's, but I just don't like this and this is my review.  Daughtry is a cool guy and I appreciate that he does class music without all the vulgarity that is in most of today's music.  I just hope he goes back to more of a hard rock sound on the next album."
A2MU9TP9YDZD42,B00FA5S4NA,2.0,"It is sad. This is nothing more than a Katy Perry-Lada Gaga-Justin Bierber vibe cd release. With the current state of the music business, the &#34;new direction for the band is more likely a &#34;new&#34; contract for Daughtry. One that says &#34;you play what we say&#34;Sad, Sad, Sad"
A2J3DS07L88QSX,B00FA5S4NA,3.0,"Here we have the latest from Daughtry - &#34;Baptized&#34;.  And while this album is not bad by any means, it's also a major change from what we've come to expect from Daughtry - and that's not a good thing.  Where past albums had multiple hard-rocking tracks like &#34;What I Want&#34; or &#34;Renegade&#34; or &#34;Outta My Head&#34;, this one has none.  Where past albums had electric guitars all over the place, this one pretty much has none.  Where past albums relied on real drums, this one makes heavy use of electronic drums.  We get an overabundance of acoustic guitar, poppy vocals, country slide guitar and banjos.  Sometimes this works well - &#34;Baptized&#34; is a great track.  Sometimes the results are hilarious, as in the awful &#34;Boom Boom Boom&#34; chorus of &#34;Battleships&#34;.  And sometimes the results are hilariously ironic, as in the &#34;Long Live Rock & Roll&#34; track that, in reality, is anything but rock & roll.  Overall, again, the album isn't bad, it's just not Daughtry.  It's some pop music, acoustic band that has completely forgotten how to rock but still manages to hit a couple decent tracks."
A1ILD4ILRI6YCC,B00FA5S4NA,5.0,"If you love Daughtry's music, you'll love this CD.  It does not disappoint.  I recommend it to all music lovers."
A2LMXTLEP8EI5Y,B00FANXZL8,5.0,"Like many of you I was so disappointed with the Next day and just give the CD away to my brother. Being an audiophile, was so nervous and excited to find out Pop King Bowie was releasing a second album. A Ep of material left off 'Next Day'. and the man always re-invents himself, after the dud disc 1, Bowie is back with disc two. every song here is better than the first album. The second CD has to be the 'Best' pop/rock album of the year. Hands down. The king is back."
A18XFJG9ZXI9GE,B00FAY6IZM,3.0,"While I have nothing but unbridled admiration for the playing of The Budapest Festival Orchestra, which has all the attributes of a chamber ensemble in that there is a luminous transparency to the sound creating a real impression of the musicians listening and relating to each other, my appreciation of their excursions into the music of Mahler under Maestro Ivan Fischer has been variable to put it mildly, ranging from total for their glorious rendering of the Fourth Symphony, through to none for their ill-thought, poorly structured misfire of a Sixth, one of the few Mahler recordings I actively dislike.In between there is a dull underpowered Second, and an eccentric First whose square rhythms and sluggish tempi in the First Movement, and extraordinary extended central Andante section of the finale which all but ceases to be music offset the brilliant playing and bravura performance of the rest of the work-not for me I'm afraid.I was trepidatious when I saw the 5th announced with a publicity blurb in which Maestro Fischer declared that this was the most Jewish of all Mahler's symphonies. I feared that we might have something approaching the pastiches by Uri Cain and his ensemble.Maestro Fischer does qualify this in a brief touching personal memoir in the accompanying booklet, though I still don't think that this supports his assertion.However, frankly I don't care. I don't listen to Mahler analysing the various influences, nor am I bothered by the &#34;borrowings &#34;from other composers, most notably Hans Rott, Liszt, Brahms and Wagner. I just want the performance to be convincing from whatever standpoint the conductor approaches it-thus I love Bernstein's VPO performance equally with Karajan's more classical approach with the BPO to name but two.In the event, this performance is exquisitely played-I cannot stress this enough-and the recording is stunning in stereo and even more so in SACD-and there is none of the exaggeration I feared, in fact I almost wish there were!This performance, for all its beauty, is for the most part routine, and in many sections outright dull.This is entirely down to the pedestrian tempi and slack rhythm adopted by the conductor.The work opens promisingly, with wonderful trumpet work in a movement where the balancing in this performance almost converts it into a concerto for that instrument. The opening funeral march is excellent, but midway through begins to lose dramatic impetus.The second movement opens entirely devoid of the &#34;extreme vehemence&#34; specified by Mahler, and limps along as a continuation of the flaccid threnody in this performance that completes the opening movement, but without any of the spitting white heat that this movement should generate. Around 4 minutes from the end there is a section which should raise the hairs and bring a lump to the throat-when the trumpet enters in the major key to thwart the overwhelming morass of Fate which is consuming the protagonist!Here it just emerges as the next notes on the page, very matter of fact and missing entirely the breathtaking effect this passage can and should have.The third movement lopes along amiably enough at a moderate tempo, and is certainly fabulously played in the tempestuous sections, but the conductor seems to think that playing louder is enough to enhance the musical argument.The 4th movement is sublime, and Fischer does not make the mistake of Barbirolli in imbuing it with so much emotional punch that finale that follows become pure bathos.The finale itself unfolds at again a moderate tempo, almost careful, and while plenty of detail is revealed, I began to feel bored by it-not what I want or expect from this great work!I fully appreciate that there will be a phalanx of listeners for whom the sheer beauty of the recorded sound will be more than enough to compensate for what I hear as its deficiencies in interpretation, and to those I commend this recording with 5 Stars.For those who want greater insights, greater emotional and dramatic impact from the work itself, I counsel caution. I wouldn't buy it again, let's put it that way, no matter how spectacular the sonics are!The aforementioned Bernstein, Karajan (not everyone's choice but I've never heard a better finale), Maazel with the VPO, Abbado BPO, Tennstedt (live) and for those prepared to forage, there is an absolutely stunning Jansons BRSO recording from BR Klassik only ever released in Germany all make better choices, and if SACD is a prerequisite Jansons with the RCO is not as gripping as in his Munich recording, but is still superb and in sound every bit as resplendent as this recording.A cautious 3 stars for this recording. Stewart CrowekComment Comment"
A328S9RN3U5M68,B00FAY6IZM,3.0,"Most concert goers and especially devotees of Gustav Mahler&#8217;s 5th Symphony are eager to scale the breadth of Mahler&#8217;s searching mind. The symphony is one of his most popular in the concert hall and on recordings and much of that is due to the love affair with the now infamous Adagio movement which has found its way into motion pictures (Visconti&#8217;s &#8216;Death in Venice&#8217; being the first that comes to mind) and the increasingly available recordings of famous Adagio movements by various composers that come close to association with Muzak.The usual fine work of conductor Ivan Fischer, especially with the very fine Budapest Festival Orchestra, here in this recording fails to ignite. The first movement unfortunately points out the incongruities of Mahler&#8217;s concepts of changes in rhythms and moods that without the control of a maestro on the podium can sound disjointed and too much like dissociated ideas. Nothing falls into line throughout the performance and even the profound emotion of the Adagio seems gutlessly pedestrian.In all, this is a disappointing recording despite the sonics (which incidentally are first class). This is a study in somnambulism. Grady Harp, December 13"
AYG0HUB0OEHYU,B00FB029E4,5.0,"In today's music industry, it's almost unheard of to release your second album only 13 months after your first, but 19-year-old Jake Bugg has the goods to back it up.  I was concerned about the album coming so soon on the heels of the first, as well as the pairing with Rick Rubin because I didn't like what Rubin did with &#34;Broken,&#34; but I can't stop listening to this.  To fans of the first album, I understand if &#34;What Doesn't Kill You&#34; and &#34;Slumville Sunrise&#34; might concern you at first.  I read a lot of complaints that he was already changing his style too quickly.  But taken in context, they are simply progressions on the rockabilly/Johnny Cash sounds of &#34;Troubled Town&#34; and &#34;Taste It.&#34;  The first six songs here are incredibly strong.  &#34;All Your Reasons,&#34; &#34;Storm Passes Away,&#34; and &#34;Simple Pleasures&#34; are other highlights.  Only &#34;Kingpin&#34; has yet to do much for me.  I'm excited to see how Jake's career progresses.  He's the real deal and I discovered him earlier this year mainly by accident.  Glad I did.  Great songwriter with many quality years ahead!"
A1JES2T184P5CN,B00FB029E4,5.0,"To all those who were unimpressed at first listen,  please try again,  and pay special attention to the deep cuts.  I find these songs to be compelling and at times astonishing.  I agree it's not as stylistically cohesive as the first album,  and yes,  the production has removed too many rough edges.  But Rubin has let Bugg's talent shine though with minimal interference.  &#34;Pine Trees&#34;  is as stripped-down and achingly lovely as anything on  &#34;After the Goldrush&#34;  And &#34;Simple Pleasures&#34;,  buried near the end of the album,  is a potent and emotional composition that will bring down the house in a large arena;  there was no equivalent on the debut.  Shangri-la earns joint honors with Kurt Vile as my favorite album of 2013"
A3HTE0OEJGCT9A,B00FB029E4,5.0,Jake Bugg has an unusual voice. I love that about him. All the songs are very good in my opinion. I am looking forward to his next CD. I recommend this one to all music lovers.
A22N03OBDDVSEB,B00FB029E4,4.0,"I'm 53 years-old, (so I should be a real prude), but I find Jake Bugg to be the real deal.  This 19 year-old has got it going for him, he seems to know real musical history.  This his 2nd release \"Shangri La\", is full of great songs and excellent guitar playing by Jake.  To me this has that 70's singer songwriter feel too it, I find Jake's guitar playing a little like early Neil Young in spots.  Great tunes in \"All Your Reasons\", \"Storm Passes By\", \"What Doesn't Kill You\", \"Simple Pleasures\", \"Kitchen Table\", \"Kingpin\", \"Messed Up Kids\", \"There's A Beast And We Feed It\", and a classic in the making (maybe) \"Slumville Sunrise\".  Jake Bugg has it going for him right now, keep doing what your doing kid.  Nice production work by Rick Rubin.  **** 1/2."
A3DCWBU4Y6V4OZ,B00FB029E4,5.0,This guy is highly talented.  I know he was on American Idol not too long ago.  I'm sure he will blow up soon!
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00FB029E4,4.0,"The latest in &#34;new Dylan&#34; wunderkinds is 19 year old Jake Bugg, a Brit who sounds like he popped out of the Greenwich Village clubs with his enigma fully intact and a sophomore album called &#34;Shangri La.&#34; And yes, that's a compliment. He's plugged in and has Rick Rubin on his team to peel back any unnecessary varnish that might have gotten stuck to the kid had anyone tried to polish him up. He's such a young gun that his voice even sounds like it has acne. That nasal bleat on &#34;There's a Beast and We All Feed It&#34; could only come from someone too young to realize that he hasn't conquered the world just yet, but old enough to think that it should be listening to his every pronouncement.Jake Bugg can run the gamut from that hard chugging opener to the more introspective &#34;Me and You.&#34;&#34;All these people want us to failBut I won't let that happen now.&#34;He sings this line like he's a knight coming to a rescue. The kid excels in earnestness. The closest I can recall another album that believed in itself so definitively was Ryan Adams when he released &#34;Gold,&#34; and I like &#34;Shangri La&#34; so much more than that album. His age is not a hindrance as he tackles some adult themes on &#34;Storm Passes Away,&#34; along with a decent pedal steel, or the street denizens of &#34;Messed Up Kids.&#34;There is a lot of raw talent on &#34;Shangri La,&#34; and it's good to hear a young talent that isn't spun off the hot-making machinery of some TV Talent contest. You may have to get past the nasal twang in the young man's voice (which is why he wouldn't have lasted an audition for the likes of &#34;American Idol&#34;), but give yourself an opportunity and you'll hear what sounds to me like a first class singer-songwriter on the way up. Jake Bugg is the real deal."
A12FLBGHU3SSJ9,B00FB7MRNK,5.0,Kellie's voice on this album is what country is all about. Twangy and expressive.This is very much like a modern version of a classic Loretta Lynn album. Tracks like 'ring for sale' and 'Selma Drye' are very catchy and tell as STORY and recorded with vocals dominating the arrangement.Thank goodness for young country singers like Kellie.
A2A92TF4H8J1Q1,B00FB7MRNK,5.0,Most of the songs were very good.  Kellie has been a favorite of mine since she first appeared on American idol and she just keeps improving.
A1ZEDKOFTEHQE1,B00FB7MRNK,5.0,This album is even better than her other ones! She has more rocking country tracks. Especially like no cure for crazy and ring for sale
A20RD0G2LRQ4L0,B00FB7MRNK,5.0,I love this alum!! Kelly is great. If want to listen to true country music and not country pop buy this album!
A1XIDTQIAQX5ZI,B00FBBW4MA,5.0,FIVE stars to the excellent music and sound...THREE stars to inner notes and booklets...ONE star to Package and ZERO stars to the ugly and superfluous Tshirt and price...The Animals deserve more!
A2JNGYDPSATWDC,B00FBDJE8K,5.0,"I have been waiting for this CD ever since seeing one of the last performances of &#34;Far From Heaven&#34; this summer. Amazing music, with lyric to match. It's not Sondheim or Rodgers and Hammerstein, but equally enjoyable. O'Hara is especially good, delivering songs that are long on story telling -- the same for Pasquale. Hightly recommedned."
A2VX9ZNX846BY7,B00FBDJE8K,5.0,It's hard to beat these performers and orchestra.  The score is stunningly beautiful and heartbreaking.  I do hope that it receives many performances!!
AVYXO0O2Z1D4M,B00FBDJE8K,5.0,"Love the show and was glad they made a recording. The music is fresh, and the performances are great. Kelli O'Hara really stands out in this role."
A1ANRKHR4QWXJU,B00FCAJZEK,4.0,"Why these concerts from May and June 1981 have been held back for such a long time is hard to understand. The concert discs may have been released earlier [LP], but only the Bregenz came out in CD and it went out of print fast. Following these events, there was Vienna and Tokyo and Paris and La Scala, Italy, and much later Rio de Janeiro. The solo concerts of Keith Jarrett always draw audiences hoping for magic. Such occurred in Bregenz and Munich, though far less often. Jarrett then was still flowing with romantic melodies and neo-classical elements. His creative experimentation required no preliminary noisy vamping while ideas took shape. Instead, we instantly were taken on a ride where jazz, classical, and gospel roots arise and blend.In the first disc of the Bregenz concerts, he moved from lyricism to a variety of rhythmic changes, and as a bouncing ball landing among strewn scores, we hear phrases and bars suggestive of familiar classical idioms and styles. The second track has a cohesive propulsive bassline while his right hand engages in musical play. We never know what will ensue -- a folk dance, a free jazz flicker? Next is the encore, the first of two renditions of the gospel ballad Heartland.The Munich concert opens in softness and a search of a theme, which arises in sonority after 5 minutes. The ostinato develops into a soulful melody of obscure Central Asian form. The music spirals until its transforms into a stacato sprightly and happy dance that, alas, goes nowhere and fades. Part II continues with some wandering about. It is somewhat gossamer, without crescendo or strong melody. Finally, at 10 minutes, a rhythm develops and a song emerges to die but two minutes later into the original quietness. A new tune then arises with harmony and power, but it too fades away. And so forth until it closes with those noisy arpeggio that dominates recent albums. Part III fortunately makes amends by commencing with a jazzy spiritual ballad filled with joy. A series of pleasant positive tunes, dances, and romances (one with a touch of Bach), all short-lived, follow. The creative font of Jarrett here is well demonstrated. Part IV has Jarrett reaching into the piano for some harp-like plinkling to go along with upper register keys in an exploration of the treble. The two encores were Mon Coeur est Rouge and again Heartland. Against the earlier experiments, these lovely straightforward renditions are more than a change of pace. They leave the audience with a smile.In summary, while Bregenz deserved to be reissued, I surmise the reason why Munich's concert was until now left behind in the CD era is because it is simply not of the high quality of performance as Bremen and Lausanne or of those solo events that followed. Still, there is much to appreciate, and the album is a worthy addition to the Jarrett fan's collection. Package notes include comments by Jarrett, an essay by Swiss critic Peter R&uuml;edi to give some perspective to this era in Jarrett's career, and poetry by Michael Kr&uuml;ger."
A1FQW6BTXMSVMH,B00FCAJZQ8,3.0,"Basically this is a mix of WORKS LIVE and the ELP- LIVE AT OLYMPIC STADIUM MONTREAL DVD with audio-rip. I  was hoping for a remastered/restored version but I guess the technology isn't quite there yet. Some of the tracks sound quite clear (Bolero,Knife Edge,Closer to Believing) while others like(Karn Evil 9, Nutrocker,Pirates) are muddy sounding almost like a bad soundboard version. I read and know about the taping issues the band had about the show but there must be better soundboard versions with the orchestral than this. For die-hard ELP fans only."
A38CWQHV6DRROT,B00FCAJZTK,4.0,"Sure some of this stuff might start sounding amateurish after a while, but there are plenty of grooves and head jamming to make any jam band fan a kick."
A3ILR5689UESWI,B00FCAK2EW,4.0,I really liked this new Streetwize CD.  I like the selection of songs and it flows really nicely.  The only problem is that I wished there were a few original songs on the CD so that it doesnt get old so quickly.  Doing all remakes kinda makes it old upfront so I can't really listen to it over and over because I've heard the songs before.
A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00FCAKAOO,4.0,"Faced with a choice of whether to buy this disc or the remastered &#34;Whipped Cream . . .&#34; (with original cover art!), I acted my age and chose this, with the idea that it would sound nice in the car.  And so it is.  It's nothing like the old Tijuana sound; rather it's moody and jazzy, and redolent of smoky clubs after hours (are such things still legal?), with Herb's trumpet sounding like a trumpet at some times and more like a tenor sax at others.  It's an engaging recording.  It starts uptempo, with &#34;Puttin' on the Ritz,&#34; but most of the disc is moodier than that.  There's a fine &#34;All in the Game,&#34; which was an early Nat Cole favorite of mine, and &#34;I only have eyes for you&#34; works well too.  The bassist and keyboardist do sterling work throughout, and Alpert's wife, Lani Hall, is heard to very good effect on a number of tracks,  Overall, my favorite track might be Astor Piazolla's &#34;Oblivion&#34; -- a moody tune done to a turn here.  Reservations?  Do we need string additions on some tracks?  Maybe a wee bit overproduced . . .?"
AB2BEOS9HJSG6,B00FCAKAOO,5.0,Another Alpert treasure...again with Lani! I just cant get enough!! Thank you Mr Alpert...your ability and your talent never ceases to amaze me.
A63ALOKUS9XHG,B00FEDP67K,5.0,"Just found this band, even though they've been around since the 80s, they didn't make it in the UK then.Named after the lead guitarist who is a master of the fretboard (hence the band named after him), the band area tight heavy rock outfit, this time rejoined by their origianl vocalist, Leather Leonne, who has a great metal range. She could sub for Bruce dickinson !!An excellent hard rock/metal album."
AQS8FI2XQO2JK,B00FF9MKY0,5.0,"Reading the reviews of the CD, I certainly had my hopes up for this recording. I am also a longtime fan and although each lineup this band has presented over the past 40 years has been nothing but first-rate, the band presented here.....the 70's line-up....are still the undisputed heavyweight champions, not only within the history of TOP, but of any horn-driven band anywhere. The definitive &#34;live&#34; TOP album &#34;Live and in Living Color&#34;  was the moment TOP planted their flag and dared anyone else to touch anything they laid down in those shows. My only criticism of that mighty recording was that is was way too brief for what they had under their belts. This CD more than makes up for that. The recording and mixing are impeccable, and the band executes each number like they mean business!! And we have &#34;live&#34; Lenny Williams on vocals to complete this snapshot of TOP in its prime. This recording now is an excellent supplement to &#34;Live and In Living Color&#34;, to more fully flesh out how hungry, tight, and funky TOP was back in the day. I read a drum ad once in which David Garibaldi stated that the goal of each TOP show was to sound as tight live as they did in the studio. &#34;Mission Accomplished&#34;!!"
A2VTXRLZG2IFFZ,B00FF9MKY0,5.0,very  good older tower power sound seem its the begining of them moving to a higher level in sound as they grew i noticed solos got more deeper
AUWYQPTTAJ2SZ,B00FF9MKY0,5.0,"The group in its prime, with its #1 vocalist Lenny Williams, stretches out on classic repertoire, funky and soulful and hip."
A2SWPTWOWEIH7W,B00FFERTUK,3.0,Bought a gift card for my granddaughter.  This is what she picked out and ordered.  I have never heard the cd.
AYSLSU7966FWE,B00FFERTUK,5.0,"Nickelback has been subject to much criticism and jokes, and I'm sure that's mostly because of how incredibly popular they became.  A lot of people wouldn't like to admit it, but Nickelback is a very talented rock band.  They're kinda like an '80s hair band in the sense that half their songs are about sex and partying, while the other half are ballads and love songs.  If you think about it, they have the spirit of classic rock and roll as much as any other band has, and they deliver incredible live shows with all the pyrotechnics and guitar/drum solos you can shake a fist at.  This hits collection seems long overdue, because every album they put out has so many hits and singles on it that it would be impossible to squeeze everything on one CD now that they've been in the mainstream for 13 years!  However, I'm impressed that they didn't get cheap and gave us a collection with a whopping 19 tracks!  There are no new songs, remixes, or basement demos on here.  That stuff is just a cash grab so the diehard fans will buy it too, but this is directed straight to casual fans.  There's nothing new on here for me, but I respect that this was put together the way a \"best of\" collection truly should be.All of the band's biggest hits seem to be here, and then some!  We have How You Remind Me which threw the band into mainstream success, and all of the similar sounding hits that came after like Someday, Photograph, and Savin' Me.  There's also the mid-tempo ballads that get everyone at the concerts singing along like Rockstar, Gotta Be Somebody, and When We Stand Together.  The group's heavier side is represented with Burn It To The Ground, Something In Your Mouth, and Never Again.  All of the ladies' favorites are here like Far Away, If Everyone Cared, Lullaby, and If Today Was Your Last Day.  The collection is rounded out with other staples like Too Bad, Feelin' Way Too Damn Good, Figured You Out, Animals, and This Afternoon.  That's a pretty thorough set!  So what's missing?  Well, the earliest songs on this set are from their 2001 album, Silver Side Up, so you won't find anything before that.  I was a little bummed to see that Leader Of Men and Breathe didn't make the cut, which were the first songs I ever heard by them back in early 2000.  They also chose not to include Bottoms Up or Trying Not To Love You, which are both from their most recent album (Here and Now) and they probably didn't want to hurt the sales of that record.  There's also a short list of less popular singles that didn't make it on here like See You At The Show, I'd Come For You, and Never Gonna Be Alone.  I don't think we expected those to make it on here though, there's too many other big hits.All things considered, this is a pretty well put together compilation, especially for only being one disc.  It's too bad that Nickelback's list of singles seems to be saturated with ballads, but I guess that's what got them where they are.  Maybe less people would be so harsh on them if they were exposed to the side of Nickelback that rocks out.  Check out songs like Burn It To The Ground, Because Of You, Side Of A Bullet, This Means War, and Animals.  Well, this should make a nice holiday gift if you know someone who loves all those radio hits and wants to have them in one place!  Here's looking forward to Volume 2!"
ANVW90BDFF11Y,B00FFERTUK,5.0,Can't wait for The Best Of Nickelback Volume 2.......lmao.......great music!!  These guys know how to rock your world in 2014.
A27AJ2LMMM6NFV,B00FFERTUK,5.0,"Now I don't have to debate which of my favorite 2 Nickelback CD's I want to put In the player.  This one CD has all my favorites.  Only 2 more am pop songs I would replace if I'd made the CD.  My grandson has already asked for my copy, my daughter wants one too so I had to order more.  This one is a keeper.  A must have for any Nickelback fan."
AHEC2APL97D06,B00FFT182K,5.0,"Great soundtrack as have been all of the other Lord of The Rings soundtracks, and the first Hobbit soundtrack."
A2DA57F3SJ6A56,B00FFT182K,5.0,"Needing a good mixture of music and songs, The Hobbit is something any music album should contain in its contents and append."
A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B00FFT182K,1.0,"As far as the music is concerned, nothing here is very unique or mesmerizing. We are in the same logic as the previous episode. It&#8217;s all happening before the events of &#8216;&#8217;The Lord Of The Rings&#8217;&#8217;. Therefore, the music cannot be as incredible. The quest for the ring is way more important, in that world, than the battle against Smaug. How could the melodies of this second trilogy be, therefore, more overwhelming than the first? So again, we have new material, less impressive, with traces of the previous partitions of the first three films. Still, without necessarily making it more &#8216;&#8217;overwhelming&#8217;&#8217;, the creators could have managed to make it more &#8216;&#8217;listenable&#8217;&#8217;. More easy to whistle. Along the line of &#8216;&#8217;Misty Mountain&#8217;&#8217; (first episode). I fail to find here a piece of music that I would really, really, really want to listen again. Of course, in the movie, all will be fine. The music will stick to the images like glue. But as a pure listening experience, without the movie, this soundtrack, like the first, has nothing exceptional to it.Try and make a compilation of all the great pieces of music of those films. Go ahead. You&#8217;ll see for yourself. The choices will come easily as far as the first trilogy is concerned. But for &#8216;&#8217;An Unexpected Journey&#8217;&#8217; and &#8216;&#8217;the Desolation Of Smaug&#8217;&#8217;, you will not have an easy time to find something worth putting alongside the melodies of the previous three films. I made for myself a compilation of all the great themes of Howard Shore. It was relatively easy but hard at the same time. That composer can be, at times, very dull, musically speaking. Very slow. With just noises or a collection of sounds instead of music. Especially at the beginning of his career. It was like that in this soundtrack (The Desolation Of Smaug) in a couple of pieces, I thought.In a world of soundtracks dominated by Hans Zimmer and his army of students (or clones), Howard Shore (along with James Newton-Howard, Alan Silvestri and all the greats) is doing nothing to make us realize that there are other composers and styles of music out there. If it&#8217;s gonna be like this, I would much prefer for all the students of Zimmer and Remote Control, his school of film music, to simply compose everything for a while. That is the trend right now. Let&#8217;s just go all the way! I&#8217;m exaggerating here but that&#8217;s just how I feel, impulsively, when I listen to a disappointing work like the soundtrack for &#8216;&#8217;The Desolation Of Smaug&#8217;&#8217;."
A2I91CUY72DWU1,B00FFT182K,5.0,"As a professional musician, almost the same age as Howard Shore, I have to say something in favour of this CD! The liner notes are a musical analysis of the score throughout the entire film This is information written in my language and has mad the experience of the score so much more meaningful for me. Just want to say thank you to the producers of the CD and the writer of the notes!! Of course, on top of that, Howard Shore has done an outstanding job of creating a Fabulous score for this film ,just as he has done all through this series of films!!I would like to add that listening to a Howard Shore score, especially for the LOTR films, is rather like listening to a Wagner opera. Howard had a series of leitmotifs that reoccur throughout the films, and if the listener is critically aware, the internal workings of the story are exposed in the music as well as in the film. Wagner would have liked what Howard has done with these stories!! Huzzah, Howard!!"
A31U0JAX302HM0,B00FFT182K,5.0,"Straight forward packaging, all the music from the movie, Howard Shore at his best yet again.Can't wait for the third and final Hobbit film."
A2ZPL1J1ATFIYA,B00FFT1BQS,5.0,"I love Ellen, I love her dancing, I love her dancing songs and her DJ's on her show! Love it!"
A298TO8CUHP5DG,B00FFWMI8U,5.0,"I rarely give 5 star reviews, but this is one of the rare albums that I can find ZERO fault with, ALL the tracks are killer no filler, every track is unique unto itself, no redundancy, superb production by Andy Sneap who is now also a full fledged member, catchy hooks galore, clever lyrics that are also mature social commentary disguised in the &#34;occult&#34; veil , unique and theatrical vocal delivery by the thespian turned frontman David Bower who seems to have slipped even more comfortably into his postion and really delivers the goods on this album. Their re-formed debut a few years back was good but this one is even better, more cohesive, catchier and more concise songwriting. The style is hard to pin down for a description,...most would say NWOBHM, but also speed, thrash, melodic, black, and cinematic metal as well. Vocalist David Bower sounds like a cross between Geddy Lee, King Diamond, and Mike Howe (Metal Church) and really emotes the lyrics in full blown theatrics, his vocals may be an aquired taste for some, but for this music he is a PERFECT fit. There may be other bands in other genres of metal that I like better, ...but in this particular style this is truly as good as it gets."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00FGFJPX2,5.0,"It was only a couple of weeks ago that I discovered Aloe Blacc's previous album to thisGood Thingson sale at Bull Moose,the local record store in my neck of the woods. Wondered why an album already several years old would've been on sale at this particular point. When I looked up the Orange County native with the apparently Panamanian back round,I discovered an unusually multi talented artist. Unusual in the sense that,aside from being a singer/songwriter and pianist but also a trumpet player. Quite unusual to hear of anyone today in the soul/funk spectrum who would be able to recognize that two seemingly disparate sounding musical instruments would both contribute nicely to a one-man band rhythm section. Not only that but before his current signing to Interscope Records,Blacc was involved in a musical collective strongly pushing pro immigration causes. That humanistic element really got my ears braced for what I'd hear when I listened to this album.\"The Man\" starts out the album,a wonderfully dynamic wall of sound type soul type anthem of empowerment that brings to mind a contemporary black man's interpretation of the E-Street Band style arena rock 'n soul sound-filled with gospel infused spirit and energy. This musical concept returns with even stronger results on \"Here Today\". The Pharrell Williams produced \"Love Is The Answer\" is my personal favorite here-a cleanly played and lean bass/guitar driven dance/funk arrangement that pleads eloquently for caring over cynicism in todays world with Blacc's deep and bluesy Gil Scott-Heron like vocal style and phrasing. Though not produced by Pharrell \"Can You Do This\" evokes a Dap-Tone-like 60's soul/funk tone similar to what Pharrell is currently doing on some of his songs. A version of his older song \"Wake Me Up\" is presented here in an acoustic country/folk style. \"Chasing\" evokes the reverb heavy uptempo gospel inspired Sam Cooke style late 50's soul while the cinematic \"The Hand Is Quicker\" and to even more effect \"The Hand Is Quicker\" have a very deep Southern blues inflected gospel attitude. The album closes with the Memphis style country soul ballad of \"Red Velvet Seat\" and the almost Philly/Chicago style \"sweet funk\" groove of the grateful and passionate \"Owe It All\".Overall this is one of the most unconventional and far reaching albums I've heard made by a young black man in the new millennium. None of the music here is at all devoted to patronizing anything at all involving contemporary electronic hip-hop/dance style productions that dominates the soul/funk/R&B; world of today still. Therefore it is not neo soul either. Nor is it a purely nostalgic retro project of any kind. This is a powerful and diverse album that manages to utilize completely modern musical production techniques and digital sound as a means of communicating what,for all intents and purposes,is something based entirely of the music of the deep Southern funk,soul and especially hard acoustic folksy blues flavors. Most importantly,he utilizes this soulfully rooted instrumental platform as a means to express a number of important lyrical messages-ranging from empowerment to the every changing moods within the ongoing battle of the sexes. His lyrical and melodic construction of his songwriting is strongly indicative of someone who realizes that a modern black male artist can possibly begin to innovate in the soul/funk spectrum without totally embracing the most juvenile elements of the mass market variant of hip-hop. And if this album is any indication,this is definitely an artist that admirers of rootsy soul/funk/blues/jazz will want to keep an eye on in the future!"
A20GTJ1G6FAGN0,B00FGFJPX2,4.0,The first song is amazing.  I wasn't wild about the rest.
A3QPA2Y4CDZUAH,B00FGFJPX2,5.0,"Reviews are mixed on this album, and being I LOVE \"The Man\" and \"Wake Me Up\", I had to get this record, and I can say, it's GREAT, not \"Aloe Bleccchhh\" as Glenn Gamboa said in his Newsday review!!  I was familiar with his name before this album and his Avicii collab...and found out he had 2 albums prior.  He looks like former Idol contestant George Huff, but nothing really religious about this Panamanian-American from southern California.Had no idea he was like Cee-Lo Green, aka a rapper-turned-soulman, but it makes sense because he writes his songs like a rapper does, with cinematic attention to story-like detail.  But his voice I just LOVE...he's like alt-soul, with similarities to people like Bill Withers, Gil-Scott Heron, Terry Callier.  And it's not straight-up R&B; either, with elements of alt-country thrown into the mix, like on \"Ticking Bomb\", where Johnny Cash comes to mind.Now, on this 3rd album (and major label debut...remember \"I Need A Dollar\"??) the US version is different from the UK version...not sure which flows better, but we'll see...tracks left off the UK version are: \"Soldiers In The City\" and \"Wanna Be With You\", as well as the title track and \"Eyes Of A Child\" (one of only 2 somewhat spiritual tracks here), which are Target bonus tracks.  There are 3 great US-only tracks: \"Chasing\", \"The Hand Is Quicker\" and \"Owe It All\" (the other one, thanking his creator for everything he has)...this Target version flows very well, but they should have included the other 2 UK-only tracks to complete it, making it 14 cuts and not necessary to have to track down the import for them...not easy to download import tracks...not sure if one is allowed or has access...the album has room, so no excuse!!Still, love Eg's style, voice and songwriting...I just wish the booklet was a BOOKLET, not just 1 page folded in half...too cheap for someone like him...my only quibble...oh and the Pharrell Williams production, \"Love Is The Answer\" is sweet, on par with anything he has on \"G I R L\"...\"The Man\" is a minor classic, transforming Elton John's \"Your Song\" into something different but just as grand, and the acoustic version of \"Wake Me Up\" is better than the Avicii single...focusing on the great song it is, not the EDM/country gimmicky hybrid.Just happy Eg is getting a name for himself, not \"the singer on that Avicii song\"...nothing against that talented Swede whatsoever..."
A29AI0KACW12K7,B00FGFJPX2,5.0,"He does not disappoint, his music is upbeat and current. Each track is excellent, heard him first on the radio."
A196MHXRAYVMHE,B00FGFJPX2,5.0,"I love &#34;The Man&#34; song and that's why I bought this CD. The other tracks are okay, but that one song did it for me. He has a unique style that's refreshing to listen to on the other tracks. Worth it!"
A3A40JYEEPT01V,B00FGGN7LW,5.0,Carrie shows her versatility in a variety of music as well as a great cast of singing by all the cast
A3VYXFXAY73JRI,B00FGGN7TE,3.0,"The music we know and love.  I think he really, REALLY needs a 2-CD compilation someday with demos (primarily the Skyscraper ones that Sheehan raved about) and such.  But here's a bullet list of what it would take to make this Single disc compilation a 5-star release:1. Volume level. The volume on this release is noticeably louder than the original 80's discs, and noticeably softer than 1997's THE BEST.  So that means you now have 3 different volumes to adjust if you make a playlist.  Regardless of what you think of the loudness wars, it would be nice for this to have had the same volume as THE BEST, at least for consistency's sake.2. \"Damn Good\". Most compilations get critiqued on song selection, but I think most DLR fans would agree that Damn Good should have been included on this.  It was a big hit for him in '88/'89 and it wasn't on THE BEST.3. Running time.  There is only 58 minutes on this CD. I don't have a problem with him using 4 songs from YOUR FILTHY LITTLE MOUTH, but then at least fill up the disc with more songs from EAT EM AND SMILE and SKYSCRAPER.4. The videos. As other have stated, this compilation is missing Just Like Paradise and Stand Up. In addition, the videos that were included were clearly not restored in any way. The images look like they came from the best possible VHS copy they could find. I don't mind them being in 4:3 since that is probably what they were shot in. I certainly wouldn't want them to crop them just to widen to 16:9."
A8PUR3YT5LS76,B00FGS1BDG,5.0,A good collection from such a talented late comer to fame.  Well worth it.  The Bruce song alone is worth the price of admission alone.
A1WK1YPXQVAYMB,B00FGS1BDG,5.0,"Glen Hansard is one of my favorite artists right now. I love his excellent songwriting and the emotional delivery he conveys. On this EP with Eddie Vedder (vinyl is cut at 45rpm), there is no let down. The sonics are excellent and the content is great!"
A2KT1BEX4YX2TX,B00FGTU3NE,4.0,"Love the album - my favorite track is The Reaping.  I would have like to have heard the band venture out end explore the genre just a bit more but hey that's just me.For reference on the reviewer, my personal Top 5 Metal Albums for 2013 are (in no particular order)1.  August Burns Red - Rescue Restore2.  The Ongoing Concept - Saloon (get their EP's too some excellent stuff in there)3.  Project 86 - Wait for the Siren (released in 2012 but still on continuous play)4.  Living Sacrifice - Ghost Thief5.  Everything in Slow Motion - Phoenix"
A2YCF7DGUDPTKL,B00FGTU3NE,5.0,"1992? I think was their debut album, where was I when artists like these make music! Last album was good if you don't have it get it. And get this too they still got it!"
A2NKT6LTP6BKJ2,B00FGTU4CE,1.0,"Sound is awful, the performances were standard (at best) and it was pretty much same ole, same ole...These guys have been around for what, twenty years? More? I can't believe a veteran group with such loyal fans would put something like this out in any kind of official capacity.Their live album &#34;Across The Wire&#34; was unbelievably great, and I've heard plenty of evidence that they can be just as great in performances throughout the last 20+ years... So why they chose to slap these subpar recordings of par performances is crazy to me.Especially after that farce of a live &#34;August & Everything After&#34; album they just slapped us all with a year or two ago.I'm done with the Crows. I've loved a lot of their stuff for a lot of years... but the sad truth is, they've been washed up and sold out more every project since August came out originally."
AWGLN183XH7MD,B00FGTU4CE,5.0,Glad they put their less famous songs on here. The August and everything after was getting a bit overdone and they do have plenty of other fantastic songs...
A1VARS9NP3IA3,B00FGTU4CE,5.0,The best band around. I love their songs an wish I could see them in concert. This cd comes very close. I wish it could have been a double cd. I just put it in the player and sing a long.
AVVRWKK55AU9C,B00FH3UHV2,5.0,"This is a beautiful 1st album by the talented group from &#34;America's Got Talent&#34;!  My mom loved getting the CD for Christmas, & I loved instantly getting the free download to my Cloud Player!  Being a Prime member, has it's perks.... LOVE!"
A31NJPKS3K9I7D,B00FH3UHV2,5.0,This is one group to watch blossom into international stars.  They should have been the #1 winners on America's Got Talent.  Have not heard anything about the winner nor seen him since the show.  He had talent but it is visual.  Forte can be enjoyed just by listening.  This is a MUST HAVE in your collection of great music sung flawlessly and in perfect harmony.
A5K2PDPACFQD,B00FH3UHV2,5.0,"Each member of this group - Josh Page, Sean Panikkar, and Fernando Varela has a great voice, but the three combined sometimes give me goose bumps.  All the songs are covers of other artists' songs, but they make them their own.  I can hardly wait for their next CD to be completed. I'm a fan."
A2Z9KTVLA8KB7C,B00FH3UHV2,5.0,"Forte more than met my expectations!  I could listen to these guys sing all day.  I listen to it in the car, at home, etc. and love it!  They should have won American's Got Talent."
A2Q2HHJFU5WIFP,B00FHGS7C0,5.0,"The most beautiful Christmas music I have ever heard. This is real Christmastime music, not Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. It's like listening to angels from above.  Lovely."
AYKKTHW0ZFD7L,B00FI2PIIO,5.0,Danielle Bradbery caught my attention on The Voice----although I am not a country music fan I really like Danielle Bradbery. I cannot wait to hear what is to come from her in the future...
A1BWSXU3HKZIVK,B00FJAKWHM,3.0,"All great songs but no elite songs such as the last album had.  All B to B+, where as the previous album had 4 A's an A- d the rest were B+ also as good as the songs are, I didn't feel there was a lot of variation, every song sounded like the previous song with a slightly changed melody. They could really use a little more variety  such as a couple of ballads."
A1V6EOHI80TZBI,B00FJBYIY4,5.0,"We were told this album would be different, and it is. I did not think I would like it, but I do. It does not have any really great songs by Switchfoot standards, but there are also no really bad songs on the album. I find myself listening to it cover-to-cover, which I find refreshing. My favorite tracks are When We Come Alive and The World You Want. Hello Hurricane remains my favorite Switchfoot album ever, but this one is very good and I applaud the band's effort to continue to challenge themselves to remain fresh and creative."
A2YP0HP7ZEZA27,B00FJBYIY4,5.0,I loved Hello Hurricane and I was a little surprised by just how well Switchfoot followed up that album with this one.  All of the songs are very thought provoking and well orchestrated.  This is a must have for any Switchfoot fan!
A1YQSJFJS6NV1X,B00FJBYIY4,2.0,I do not like their style change. I am more of a hard rock guy and miss their stuff from Beautiful Letdown and Lonely Nation
A1R58VOXWFQCQA,B00FJSSK1O,5.0,"Ten years after their first concert, Epica had gathered in Eindhoven for a single date on march, 23, 2013, a sonic extravaganza serving both as a best of and a crowning of sorts for the leading band of symphonic metal. This 2DVD/3CD pack serves as a memento of the event and it is no standard rock DVD. The multiplicity of cameras, lights, musicians, mikes and collaborators would be expected from a much bigger band, something like U2's360 at the Rose Bowl. While very successful, Epica is still in a niche market but manages to look and sound like a monster band.For ten years, Epica has served their recipe of bombastic metal characterized by a now classic Beauty and the Beast approach to vocals -although Simone Simons' vocals usually set tone- and a cinematic blend of classical orchestrations and metal band. Neither were a first. In the interviews accompanying the concert, Mark Jansen, the band's co-founder, gives a heads up to the pioneering work of The Gathering as a seminal symph metal influence. As for the orchestral sound, one might say that where Nightwish veers towards Andrew Lloyd Weber, Epica is fonder of Hans Zimmer. After ten years, they have convincingly created their own sound.The concert, like the DVD production, is almost flawless. Almost, because there is certainly some overproduction, particularly in the lighting department, that almost detracts from seeing the band at times but Epica would not be the first band to fall into this minor trap. It is up to you to decide how much of a flaw this is, since it is after all a movie even if it is a concert first.As it is a trip down memory lane, we are treated to oldies like Cry for The Moon from their first album but also from their original demo when they were still called Sahara Dust, all the way to Serenade of Self-Destruction, the closing track of their latest studio album,Requiem For The Indifferent. In order to go the distance, and despite almost three hours, choices had to be made. Hence we are treated to Design Your Universe but not Kingdom of Heaven (except in an instrumental medley), Delirium but not Tides of Time and so on. As bonuses, one original song, aptly named Retrospect, and Twin Flames, a North American Bonus track from RftI.A nostalgic aspect of the concert is the return of original band members Yves Huts, Jeroen Simons and Ad Sluijter for Quietus, fromConsign to Oblivion. And a guest tour of Floor Jansen for two songs (one classic Pergolese Duo and Sancta Terra). Floor is the new lead singer of Nightwish and also the front of her own band, ReVamp, but she was of course the singer of After Forever, another legendary dutch band, now defunct, where Mark Jansen officiated before leaving to found Epica. Missing, perhaps, are Amanda Sommerville who covered vocally for Simons in 2008 when she was dealing with complications from MRSA, and Oliver Palotai, Simons' significant other -and Kamelot keyboardist-who covered for Coen Janssen in 2010. But it's a pretty good reunion anyway. Even more so when one considers that Epica is backed here by the Remenyi Ede Chamber Orchestra and the Choir of Miskolc National Theatre, two ensembles that had already backed them for 2009'sThe Classical Conspiracy.It is a challenge to do symphonic metal live. The female singer, usually a lyric soprano of sorts -although Simons' casts herself more as a mezzo, probably because of the rich control of her mid range- has to perform surrounded by pounding drums and brutal riffs. As a consequences, she is not always heard at her best. Simons has been known to be pitchy in concert and even Tarja Turunen, every singer's North Star in the field, seemed perplexed at times in Nightwish's now classic DVD concert,Nightwish: End of an Era. As for the male singers, grunts being not that natural a production of the voice box, they risk sounding punier and murkier live than in studio or risk their voices forcing them. Not easy. If one adds that symphonic metal relies on ringing orchestrations that sound a little plasticky when they come only from a keyboard, it is easy to understand the challenge.With Retrospect, everything falls in place. Voices are in place, sound is well balanced, orchestra and choir soar with the band with thrilling effect,  as in Serenade of Self Destruction, Design Your Universe, or a few alternative intros (Unleashed). The band, polished by near incessant touring over the last few years, is tight and playful, even though Epica is not particularly focused on showmanship. After Retrospect, Epica has continued touring and is preparing their next album but one feels that a page has turned. Simone Simons had her first child in october which might change her love for non-stop touring. And even though Epica's last album was almost as formidable asDesign Your Universe, one has a sense that is was just more of the same, with the risk of turning in circle. Epica has done so well for ten years that the bar has been set quite high.All in all, there is joyfulness that comes out of this milestone DVD/CD, the joy of a band in full force. One might compare it to Within Temptation'sBlack Symphonyfrom 2008. It does not have the bittersweet taste of Nightwish's End of an Era of even more ofLast Curtain Call, Theatre of Tragedy's poignant farewell from 2011. But it was a hell of a concert."
A3TKL7X26QKKMO,B00FJX95LS,5.0,"Tampa's iconic death metal legends Deicide have once again returned to do what they do best, and that's unleash an all out savagely blistering dose of pure unrelenting, blasphemous old school death metal with their 11th studio album \"In the Minds of Evil\" which is guaranteed to crush and annihilate your sense with intense lethal brutality and annihilation. Picking up where 2011's \"To Hell With God\" left off, \"In the Minds of Evil\" shows Deicide moving away from the melodic inclinations of their previous few albums and steering towards the \"old school\" death metal sound reminiscent of the band's 1992 sophomore classic \"Legion\", and this album definitely captures that old school feel of \"Legion\" for sure indeed. This album is just absolutely unrelenting, intense, and viciously awesome from start to finish and shows that Glen Benton and co. continue to better themselves musically with age and experience. The production here on \"In the Minds of Evil\" is handled by Jason Suecof and his production here is very top notch and it is also dare I say the best produced Deicide album that I've ever heard in my opinion since the Scott Burns era in the 90's. Glen Benton once again delivers yet another great vocal performance on here just like as he did on \"To Hell With God\". His raw and powerful lacerating lion-like growls and roars are exactly what you would expect from him: Sharp, intense, hostile, commanding, hate filled, yet clear and understandable throughout. His vocals on this album are very slightly reminiscent of classic Deicide albums such as \"Once Upon the Cross\" and \"Serpents of the Light\", meanwhile this album also features less of the infamous demonic shrieks that Glen is so well known for which are used occasionally and it allows him to put much more focus and passion into his growls and roars on here. Steve Asheim's drumming is just absolutely top notch as always as he anchors and drives each track throughout with savagely pummeling blast beats as well as some pounding thrash metal style beats (listen to \"Godkill\" for example), and pummeling waves of double bass kicking throughout. The guitars are also top notch here as well as both Jack Owen and new guitarist Kevin Quirion (who replaces Ralph Santolla) unleash a lethal arsenal of heavy, intense, hot flaming, barn burning riffs and plenty of awesomely wicked, trail blazing and ear shredding solos which are still melodic in nature as well guaranteed to make every single hair on the back of your head stand and your pearly whites grin evily with pure delight.Album highlights:Every song on here is a winner, but I don't plan on going into detail on each song, so I'll focus on the songs that stand out the most to me starting off with the album's opening title track which begins with a voice of someone saying \"Some men just want to watch the world burn\" before jumping out of the speakers and kicking into high gear with an arsenal of brutal chugging, gut punching, barn burning thrash induced riffs, straight forward driving double bass drumming, and hostile roars, plus a nice shredding solo is included as well. Next up, we have \"Thou Begone\", another favorite which is highlighted by catchy pumping galloping riffage, rolling double bass kicks, and furiously lacerating vocal patterns, plus savagely fast and blistering tempos and some fairly nice winding melodic soloing to boot, meanwhile track three \"Godkill\" is a real treat for classic thrash metal fans as it is anchored by straight ahead, full throttle pounding thrash tempos along with hot scorching and adrenaline rushing thrash induced riffing and vicious hot tempered roars from Glen, plus some pummeling blast beats which set the build up for some awesomely intense, blazing and shredding solos. Definitely an awesome track for sure. Elsewhere, \"Beyond Salvation\" is highlighted by a mixture of slow yet menacing and marching, headbanging grooves, as well as furiously rapid fast tempos throughout. This song also features more great catchy riffage and commanding vocals, as well as another great solo being thrown in.Other highlights on here include \"Misery of One\" which boasts more malevolent blasting and savage riffing as well as more demonic, lacerating roars and another awesome solo to boot, as well as the Morbid Angel-esque \"Between the Flesh and the Void\" (which is probably my favorite track on here), \"Even the Gods Can Bleed\" (which is highlighted by a short winding and wailing opening solo and chuggy riffs before erupting into an explosive onslaught of more furious blasting and fiery, bruising riffs that are bound to just destroy everything in sight). \"Kill the Light of Christ\" is also another memorable highlight that features a dark and warped intro before going into more dark and sinister riffing, plus more crushing, earthshaking blast beats, and very memorable chorus lines with Glen sounding like he's singing some demented church gospel or something, and the album's final track \"End the Wrath of God\" which ends the album on a very furious note is highlighted by furiously abrasive, teeth grinding, hot burning riffs, violent full throttle drumming, savage growls and roars throughout, plus a wickedly blistering, and wailing shredding solo section as well.All in all, \"In the Minds of Evil\" is yet another killer and worthy addition to Deicide's discography, and in my opinion it is also one of Deicide's very best albums I might add as well as being one of the best death metal albums of 2013, especially in a stellar year where we've seen many great old school death metal releases including those from Carcass, Suffocation, Gorguts, Broken Hope, Immolation, Autopsy, etc. This album is simply nothing short of pure straight up old school blasphemous death metal to the bone, and it shows why death metal fans went nuts for Deicide in the first place. So anyways, if you've heard of Deicide before, then by all means don't miss out on \"In the Minds of Evil\"...Believe me, it's that damn awesome!!! Strongly Recommended!!!\\m/"
A1NEQS0XEWHX0H,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,"well worth the wait. eminem is back and showin no signs of slowing down. awesome how he continued where mmlp one left off, not disappointin at all"
A14J32O0JNVAFV,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,"Eminem does it again!  I had to buy this because I know Eminem had another hit on his hands.  From Monster and Bezerk, this album is chock full of hits."
A1R4HQIWADCTP0,B00FKAA3MA,4.0,"Not quite like Marshall Mathers the original, but typical Eminem; meaning - he raps it in his own style and in his own way. It is a must have for the Eminem collectors much like myself."
AAHDBJWKKB6KX,B00FKAA3MA,3.0,"That pretty much sums this one up. Same old really. If you like Eminem and grew up listening to him as i did you will be let down. He's getting older, softer and sounding more like pop than rap with every album. This cd is good as tolerable background noise but it falls worlds short of his earlier groundbreaking styles and lyrics."
A1LH63LHZD4H1A,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,WOW.  That's all I can say after listening to this.  Eminem really poured his heart and soul into this one.  His rhymes are so fast and so creative that I'm so busy marveling at some of them that I have to give it another listen just to hear what I missed.  It will be hard to top this one.  Way to go Slim!
A1753XGRBCI40O,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,"I'm not the biggest Eminem fan on the planet (I thought relapse was his best album, since slim shady) but i enjoy sick lyrics more than i care about hooks and melody.  This was good mix of the two..  The pop styles that made him world famous, and the lyrics that made him a rap god."
A12EXJX3HL5619,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,I like this one from him because it sounds like his earlier songs.  Great buy and will not be disappointed.
A22NNWUODHG86O,B00FKAA3MA,3.0,"While his rapping is better than ever, these songs just don't stick with you like his older stuff. They just don't flow, they aren't memorable... Outside of the single Bezerk, none of the songs have a sing a long type chorus... Really a bummer since his verses are better than ever but his chorus's just feel flat for me and the tracks he chose were disjunct. Doesn't feel very thought out."
A151JSJYHTN4T2,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,This deluxe edition is probably his finest work overall since Encore.  Blows right past Relapse and Recovery but those were still at least 4 star albums anyway.  This should get 5 mics in The Source and will probably win a Grammy.
ARR8RENRCARZP,B00FKAA3MA,3.0,"I finally got to listen to this album all the way through and what I feared after hearing the singles is true. This album is very mediocre compared to his other stuff I would put it just above Encore, which is by far his worst. My criticism has very little to do with the lyrics although some are just lazy. My main issue is the album runs along without a break of any kind it almost seems like one long song, and most of the tracks lack the fire and anger found on the first MMLP. The first half of the album is almost painful to listen to, it does pick up a little towards the midway point, around &#34;Rap God&#34;. My last issue is the hooks, most of them are just terrible, none of them are catchy or memorable. I hope with a few more listens more of the songs will grow on me, but now I just have to hope the next release will be miles ahead of this one."
AIDFLFUKJ657I,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,this is an excellent new cd by 1 of the godfathers back when gangsta was cool. why all the low rates artists evolve and change at least its not all the way pop like most of the modern crap today.get this play it loud. stand for something real not off a computer.
AXYREDPYD0LQ9,B00FKAA3MA,5.0,"Plainn and simple, he is the god of rap.  I own each one of his cd's (I am 46 yrs. old btw) and I will never stop buying them!"
A2HTF88O2QYO7D,B00FKVP34M,5.0,"&#34;Thanks&#8221; is a blues- and gospel-infused 5-track EP by the singer-songwriter with the distinctive contralto voice, Shelby Lynne. These original, Americana gospel songs were recorded at her Rancho Mirage home studio and the mini-album was co-produced by Shelby Lynne and Ben Peeler.The catchy rocker &#8220;Call Me Up&#8221; is a great opener, followed by the upbeat &#8220;Forevermore.&#8221; The most gospel-ish song on the EP is &#8220;Walkin&#8217;,&#8220; with great backing vocals by Maxine Waters and a catchy chorus that goes: &#8220;My feet don&#8217;t need, To wander no more, I&#8217;m walking in the steps of the Lord.&#8221; This is ensued by the haunting, bluesy ballad &#8220;This Road I&#8217;m On,&#8221; in which she sings about how &#8220;Faith, keeps me busy trying to find it.&#8221; The EP finishes with the countrified title track &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; another great example of modern country-gospel.As Shelby herself said about this EP: &#34;As a musician, these songs are a way to express my love and gratitude to the universe and to all of the music appreciating souls out there for the friendship and fellowship that music brings us&#8230; all in the name of love and sharing.&#34; So: thanks for sharing these wonderful songs, Shelby!"
A6KAKS4MSAJGN,B00FKVP34M,5.0,"I have met Shelby a few times here in the Detroit area and I just love her!  Her voice is so rich, full of raw emotion!  She just keeps getting better and better and better and better!"
A19Y68G415SW8G,B00FLDG42Y,5.0,"This might be Rush's best live recording to date & this is coming from someone who didn't think they could top \"Snakes and Arrows\" but the more I listen to these three CDs, the more I'm becoming convinced.Listening to \"Middletown Dreams\" as I type & I scratch my head as to why I ever had doubts about Rush playing some of the lesser known tracks from \"Power Windows.\" \"Dreams\", \"Grand Designs\", and \"Territories\" all rocked and the rarely played gem \"The Body Electric\" is quickly becoming one of my favorite live tracks.The new material from \"Clockwork Angels\" gets better with each new listen, particular standouts for me are \"The Wreckers\", \"Seven Cities of Gold\" and \"Wish Them Well\". The string accompaniment the band employed on this tour was a definite success in my book.And I really enjoyed the strings on some of the old classics like \"Red Sector A\" and \"YYZ\". I don't know if I would say it was the best renditions of those songs, but it's very close to the top for me.Overall, if you love Rush then this 3 CD set should be very much to your liking.5 stars"
A20T3J1UG6ZKJT,B00FLDG5AA,4.0,"I have loved the Crossroads shows  Since the first one in 2004! It's very well recorded and the performances are out standing, noticeably by Vince Gill with Albert Lee in Rodney Crowells &#34;Aint livin long like this&#34;, Sonny Landreth and Derek Trucks &#34;Congo Square&#34;, I was so impressed with Landreth i went back to see his catalog and ordered his instramental CD Elemental journey! Also the legends Clapton, Beck,Gregg Allman,Buddy Guy,Earl Klugh and Robert Cray are all terrific!"
ATVTCRR1OWGDK,B00FLDG5AA,5.0,"terrific collection of musicians and have enjoyed all of the crossroad cd's, especially enjoy this one and the collections of artists"
A2H94FN8TELGQY,B00FLDG5AA,5.0,I've really enjoyed Eric Clapton's music for more years than lots of people can remember.  This is an excellent collection of talent.  It in includes some classic Clapton and a hauntingly beautiful Irish tune with a magnificent combination of electric guitar and violin.  The two discs are packed with memories and new ideas.
A3AP0OZLZSON01,B00FLDG5AA,3.0,"As much as I wanted to like this...it bored me.  The audio is not good at all.  The camera work is an over attempt at being artistic but falls flat.  There does not seem to be any passion with ANYONE that is playing.  I'm not a big Allman bros fan but the clips were cool.  Doyle sounds great. The ensemble at the end seems like it was edited down or something.  Jeff Beck is probably one of the cooler clips considering he was limited on previous CR DVD's. I hate John Mayer but his set was kind of cool. Buddy Guy was just lame (even though I am a big fan) Damn right he's got the blues when he has to play that terrible song over and over.  It took me two day's and watched it twice and I still can't remember anything that blew me away.  Much of the same songs just played again years later.  Man, Jimmy Vaughan is like watching my dog pant.  Keith Urban surprised me.  The best part was probably the closing set with Clapton.  Everyone seemed either &#34;late for something else&#34; or got the request to play that morning and they were not prepared.  In my opinion....wait until VH1 classic has it on, the commercials will give you time to get a beer and mow the lawn."
A25GNPYHTVFS0R,B00FLDG5AA,4.0,"I have had this album (album?, I am 53 LOL) for about two months now.  The Clapton music didn't move me, but I already have so many of his albums and listened to him so many times that it has become a little old.  The other musicians for the most part really impressed me.  Every song has at least one very good guitar solo.  The different spin the vocalists used on the songs were interesting and for the most part were as enjoyable as the original.  To get a five star it should be one of those albums you would want if stranded on a deserted island.  This was a four.  Maybe a 3 1/2 if the sound of a well played electric guitar doesn't move you."
A2RKMP51KF0WM6,B00FLDG5AA,5.0,"The Crossroads shows are all phenomenal, and you could feasibly own them all, and have a very tasty collection.  Wish other artists would do this, but when Eric does it, it seems so logical.  I guess the blues style lends itself to this kind of sitting in, This is, as other previous editons, top notch!!!"
A2ST8841E7MZK0,B00FLDG5AA,5.0,"If you like Eric, you'll like this CD. There are many good cuts here and many great musicians. I have so many Clapton CD'sthat are just Eric. Its very nice to have one thats Eric AND some of his great musician friends."
A159HU9SU49EGP,B00FLDG5AA,5.0,This CD is everything my fiance wanted! All of these shows are great-glad that we can listen to the new one on CD. Fast shipment!
A2AOM4JG07GPFM,B00FLUD46Q,5.0,"i love CELTIC THUNDER....and this cd was incredible as I expected....they never do anything half-way....talent, talent, talent, and remarkably talented gentlemen."
A1ILP4QEJ5F129,B00FLUD46Q,5.0,SUPER!
A21H277KNO60T8,B00FLUD46Q,5.0,A great addition to our Christmas music and a great addition to our Celtic Thunder collection. Loved every minute of it.
A3SX5OYZ80U6YD,B00FLV07RY,5.0,"Krystal Keith is an excellent country artist.  And her new album Whiskey & lace is excellent too.  I bought it on amazon.com.  Some of the songs on it are: Doin' it, can't buy you with money, and daddy dance with me, etc."
A2ZIO3TS681N7J,B00FMF3R0I,5.0,"Volume 2 &#34;On Air&#34; is great, but the remastered original is barely worthwhile. I can hear a bit of difference (clearer sound on the already better recordings), but if you're a big fan on a budget, don't feel bad for only buying &#34;On Air&#34;. It's about 70% gems, the rest fairly repetitive."
A6AOLZK82A67C,B00FMF3R0I,5.0,"I enjoyed there albums, anthology and DVDs. this is a great one to get if you like rare out takes."
A1DT4L5CM4SM6M,B00FMVV326,3.0,Even after reading the reviews bought this CD anyway because I wanted to listen to the other songs.  The cd should have said the six (6) additional songs are acoustic and not a complilation like the rest of the music on the CD.
AIUDCYM92DLXZ,B00FMVV326,5.0,They are a fantastic group and have been since their start.
A19XXNY25JO2LW,B00FN3HRFA,5.0,"&#8220;Back to Brooklyn&#8221; brings the famous New Yorker herself, Barbra Streisand, back to her hometown for the first time since she left the borough as a teenager, to pursue her path to a celebrated career that continues to captivate audiences around the globe five decades later.  The instantly recognizable voice, the dry wit, the remarkable ability to deliver a song, have all been traits of this superstar, and this concert is a welcomed new recording from the storied performer.The Sony Music release consists of both a DVD and a CD, with the concert containing hits both originally performed and/or written by Streisand, and others that have been favorites of the singer, but had not been recorded by her.  She pays tribute to several of her good friends, including Marvin Hamlisch (&#8220;The Way We Were,&#8221; &#8220;Through the Eyes of Love,&#8221; and who passed away while she was preparing these shows) and the songwriting team of Alan and Marilyn Bergman (&#8220;Nice &#8216;n&#8217; Easy,&#8221; &#8220;That Face&#8221;).  Streisand has never been shy about getting permission to change lyrics, and this recording is no exception.  She turns both Andrew Lloyd Webber&#8217;s &#8220;As If We Never Said Goodbye&#8221; and Cole Porter&#8217;s &#8220;You&#8217;re the Top,&#8221; into Brooklyn love letters, molding the audience into putty in her hands from the very beginning of the evening.One of the musical highlights of the evening is a three-song medley by another Streisand friend, composer Jule Styne.  Hearing the superstar sing &#8220;Rose&#8217;s Turn&#8221; and &#8220;Some People,&#8221; both from the famed musical, &#8220;Gypsy,&#8221; you&#8217;d wish she had played the iconic role of Mama Rose, while her version of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Rain On My Parade&#8221; is still, at 70 years of age, the only voice that should tackle this challenging solo from Styne&#8217;s &#8220;Funny Girl.&#8221;An endearing duet with her son, Jason Gould, of &#8220;How Deep Is The Ocean,&#8221; several pieces accompanied by Chris Botti on trumpet (&#8220;What&#8217;ll I Do,&#8221; &#8220;My Funny Valentine&#8221;) and the group, Il Volo (&#8220;Smile,&#8221; only on the DVD release) help to mix up the evening, but ultimately the audience only cares about hearing Streisand sing whatever she wants to.  As the Webber song says, she&#8217;s &#8220;come home at last.&#8221;"
A2JNGYDPSATWDC,B00FN3HRG4,2.0,"I have always enjoyed Streisand concert CDs and DVDs, but not this one. I really tried, but her voice is far from what it used to be -- understandable given her age, but still a problem for me. As with her other concerts, the camera shows delighted fans giving Barbra standing ovations after standing ovations. So that people know, I did see her in concert in 2006, and enjoyed it a lot."
A340DPZNER8364,B00FN3HRG4,5.0,"First I have to say that those folks who point out and complain about how she doesn't sound as good as she once did, who does? This is a seventy-something woman, who can still make almost any song still sound better than good! As to the cover art, who cares? If they retouched it, so be it. That has nothing to do with the awesome talent of this fabulous songbird.She starts the concert with As If We Never Said Goodbye, does a terrific Nice N Easy/That Face and a beautiful rendition of Bewitched, Bothered, Bewildered. Her tributes to Marvin Hamlisch and to Jules Styne are great. She shares the stage with thefantastic Chris Botti and her duet with son Jason Gould is fantastic as well. The young man has a voice--I hope he makes some CD's of his own.There are many fine songs including My Funny Valentine, Here's to Life and Some Other Time. She puts her own mark on every tune she sings. Someone compared her to Judy Garland.  Garland was a dynamic performer, but never lived to 50, so there can be no comparison.I would recommend this concert to anyone who loves to hear a great singer who still can sing!"
A19FQKV296JZCT,B00FN3HRG4,5.0,"The DVD and CD are fantastic, it's fun to watch Barbra interact with the audience and her duets with her son, Jason, are beautiful."
A2KB564KNK2Z5Z,B00FN3HRG4,5.0,"Comparing this release to the other Streisand concert albums, I would say this one is much better than the 2006 Concert, especially, in terms of vocal performance. Definitely, she is now not as good as she was so many years ago (vocally), but artistically, she is still very pleasant to listen to: more relaxed and more mellow. Listen to her vibrato on the last note of the opening number (As If We Never Said Goodbye) and you will realize how great she sounds and how relaxed she is. (I loved that note!!! Great job, Barbra!) Despite some occasional raspy notes, she can still deliver a great kind of vocal quality. At 71 years of age, she could be my grandma but my grandma can't sing half as beautifully as she does. So, for your own pleasure and enjoyment (and happiness,  in general), there is no need being critical of anything in your life. Be open-minded and take the 71-year-old Barbra as she is. Let's give her some respect. No matter what, she is one of the greatest artists who ever lived, anyway."
A19XXNY25JO2LW,B00FNRA1D6,5.0,"Known primarily for the lightning precision with which he navigated each and every dance step, Fred Astaire (1899-1987) applied the same pursuit of perfection to his vocal tracks for each of the films he made during his storied stage and cinematic career.  Sony Entertainment has now released a two-disc compilation of Astaire's most noted vocal performances, and its easy to sit back with a pair of headphones and be transported back to the Golden Days of Hollywood, with the ultra-suave song and dance man smoothly gliding us through many of the hits of the 1930's.The writers of these classics were a who's who of hitmakers from the era:  Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin.  They frequently wrote for Astaire, as they knew his performances would contain the passion and integrity their melodies craved.\"The Early Years at RKO\" begins with two tracks from \"Flying Down to Rio,\" the first film to feature Astaire with Ginger Rogers, who together would redefine the musical theater dance world.  The orchestral performances on these recordings are superb.  Whether under the band leadership of Ray Noble, Leo Reisman, or Johnny Green, the instrumental tracks throughout the more than thirty songs are equally up to the task of melding with Astaire's vocal to create a musical ambience that would ultimately peak in a dance feature.Many of the songs associated with Astaire are here: Irving Berlin's \"Cheek to Cheek,\" \"No Strings\" and \"The Piccolino\"; Kern's \"Pick Yourself Up\" and \"A Fine Romance\"; Porter's \"Night and Day\"; Gershwin's \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" and \"Nice Work If You Can Get It.\"  The release also contains six Bonus Tracks, including two vocals from Rogers (\"The Yam\" and \"I Used To Be Color Blind\") and an Alternate Take of \"A Fine Romance,\" recorded at a faster tempo then eventually preferred by Jerome Kern.Great music for dinner parties, or for just relaxing in the daytime, \"The Early Years at RKO\" is the perfect accompaniment."
AJNQTSR3IMW8Z,B00FNRA7RQ,5.0,I got say this is a quality mix of artists and one of the better now releases in a while. Who can beat getting your favorite radio hits on all one cd.
A2V8PM4FL3YGE5,B00FNRA7RQ,5.0,"I had ordered this compilation from Amazon.com & I rec'd it on January 21, 2014.  A lot of this music incl., here on \"Now 48\" includes hits that closed out 2013 & opened 2014 on the American Top 40 Countdown.  I would like to offer my review of this album as follows:1.  \"Roar\"...As of the week ending October 26, 2013, this hit by Katy Perry, was @ the #1 spot for 5 weeks on the Top 40 Countdown.  This song is pretty good.2.  \"Blurred Lines\"...This hit single, by Robin Thicke, reminds me of a song that Prince OR Michael Jackson could have performed very well.  This song is pretty good.3.  \"Take Back The Night\"...This song by \"J.T.\" ISN'T as familiar to me, but I do like it very well.4.  \"Summertime Sadness\"...As of the week ending October 26, 2013, THIS song by Lana Del Rey was in the #4 spot on The TOP 40 Countdown.  I loved THIS song immediately,  even if it IS haunting & rather WEIRD.  The version incl., HERE is the 2013 Cedric Gervais Remix Edit.  Just yesterday, 01/24/14, I ordered her 2012 album \"Born To Die\" so that I may hear what the ORIG. version of \"Summertime Sadness\" will sound like & PLUS all the OTHER songs, on THAT album.  This song is one of my TOP favorites, that TIES w/ \"Wake Me Up\" by Avicii.5.  \"Get Lucky\"...I really love & enjoy this song by Daft Punk.  Musically, this song COULD remind me, somewhat., of \"Good Times\" & ESP. \"My Forbidden Lover\".  BOTH of these songs were performed by Chic, in 1979.6.  \"Treasure\"...This song, by Bruno Mars, is pretty good.7.  \"Love Somebody\"...Maroon 5 performs this hit & I think it's pretty good.8.  \"Wake Me Up\"...This song is just plain EXCELLENT in my honest opinion.  It's one of my TOP favorites that TIES w/ \"Summertime Sadness\".  It is ALSO one of my favorite songs that Avicii ever performed, so far.  The music, the beat & the male vocalist is also GREAT.  On the week ending January 18, 2014, Avicii's \"ON THE VERGE\" song \"Hey Brother\" was also INTRODUCED on the Top 40 Countdown.9.  \"We Can't Stop\"...When I heard this song before, I always thought  it was Rihanna performing this one.  This song is okay & it's performed by Miley Cyrus.10.  \"Applause\"...As usual, I love any song that Lady Gaga performs & this song is no exception.  Great beat here.  On Thanksgiving Night 2013, I saw a show of Lady Gaga's feat. some of her songs from 2013's album called \"Artpop\".  She also feat. a few guests like Sir Elton John & etc.  Just yesterday, 01/24/14, I bought her \"Artpop\" from Amazon & I'm excited to hear her new album release.11.  \"Slow Down\"...This song, by Selena Gomez, is pretty good.  I notice that Dev & the Cataracs name is mentioned quite often.12.  \"Everything Has Changed\"...This song is by Taylor Swift & it feat. Ed Sheeran.  I like this song quite well.13.  \"Brave\"...This song, by Sara Bareilles, is pretty good.14.  \"Still Into You\"...This song, by Paramore, isn't too bad.15.  \"Sail\"...This song is Awolnation is just okay & it's NOT a favorite of mine.16.  \"That's My Kind Of Night\"...This song, by Luke Bryan, is a COUNTRY song & it is fun & enjoyable to listen to.Bonus Tracks17.  \"Harlem\".  This bonus track, by New Politics, is pretty good.18.  \"I Believe (In Me & You)\"...I really LOVE this song, by Basic Vacation.  Nice vocal harmonies, good music & you can FAINTLY hear some chimes.  I sincerely hope that this song will be on the TOP 40, if it hasn't been already.19.  \"Drunken Hearts\"...This song, by Wallpaper, isn't too bad.  It did grow on me after a fashion.20.  \"On Our Way\"...This song, by The Royal Concept, I really HOPE will enter the American Top 40, if it hasn't already.  This song is great & has a lot of potential,  I really love this song w/ such cheerful & positive lyrics.  Good music & nice harmonies, too.This \"Now 48\" compilation is most definitely recommended & to be enjoyed.  I have played this CD a lot since I rec'd it recently.  And THIS particular volume is keeping me in touch w/ the songs that are STILL charting on the American Top 40 Countdown."
A1Z1UD8RE0D15A,B00FNRA7RQ,4.0,"This compilation is definitely the way to go if you just want to play a great CD with really good, fun music from begining to end. I have purchased many of the past NOW CD's and this is another great one. And AMAZON's amazing deal where you get the MP3 version for free immediately after you purchase the physical CD just can't be beat by anyone. I had the album on my computer the same day and received the CD a fast few days later. I still like CD's and AUTO RIP gives me the best of both worlds. That's why I only buy my music from AMAZON exclusively now."

A3GJKAA1KA8O7M,B00FP8F97G,5.0,"Like a dark love letter to its fans, Nox Arcana's Legion of Shadows is a breathtaking symphony of both romance and sinister mystery, bringing together the best elements of Nox Arcana's elegant Christmas CDs and its darker soundscapes, such as Shadow of the Raven. As a result, it's absolutely perfect for any mood or setting. A mysterious, eerie music box motif recurs in many songs, creating an atmosphere of otherworldly wonder. Some of the more memorable tracks include &#34;Loveless,&#34; which features harpsichord, music box and piano in a stately, romantic ode to lost love; &#34;On Dark Wings,&#34; a brilliant piano- and strings-dominated anthem that has the turbulent, sweeping feeling of a gothic symphony; and &#34;Dreamscape,&#34; one of Nox Arcana's most beautiful, sophisticated piano songs and a definite romantic highlight of the CD. Nox Arcana even offers their wonderful, powerful interpretation of Bach's pipe organ classic &#34;Toccata and Fugue.&#34; In this CD, Joseph Vargo provides his fans with a lush tapestry of songs that evokes wistful longing, doomed romance, dark passion and ghostly fascination. As usual, Vargo packages this CD with striking, chilling art that makes this album a visual treat as well."
A3SOYVAQICNX4Y,B00FPJ8GGQ,5.0,"This is the only record I have been listening to since it dropped. It's amaizing! Let's just say if it didn't have that seventy something page script to go along with it? This record would still be insane. It's Artistic, it's aggressive it's catchy the beats are dope!  It's just nasty!! What a way for gambino to go out for the year.  A master peace."
A2K17XF5VEOR0S,B00FPJ8GGQ,4.0,This album is definately a step up from his earlier work. I hope that he gets better as time goes on because he will certainly get the recognition that he deserves.
A303TXMEPQXW9D,B00FPJ8GGQ,5.0,"I thought Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid M.A.A.D City ruined me for years to come, until I heard this album.After first listen, I thought there were a few good cuts but the album seemed chaotic and hard to follow. Gambino showed his normal lyrical dexterity and wittiness but I wasn't fond of the production. Something compelled me to do a little more research on Andrew Auernheimer and it lead me to the screenplay that is to accompany this album. I always knew about it just never invested the time.WOW. Reading the screen play takes this album from a decent/good album with a few tolerable tracks to one of the best and most artistic pieces of music I have ever heard. The production makes so much more sense, it really captures the appropriate feeling at that moment in the screenplay. The album is so cohesive, the vision is clear, and deep. Like Lamar's GKMC, this album needs to be reviewed as a whole not by each individual song. Everything fits perfectly, and the screenplay picks up from where the last track on his Camp LP, That Power, left off. It explores &#34;the boy&#34; and his failed relationships and general angst towards the world among other things. After reading the screenplay, every time I listen to the album I have a movie playing in my head.I am a true lover of hip hop Nas, Lupe, Common, Kanye (pre yeezus that was trash), Kendrick, Mos Def, this album absolutely fits in with those other great artist. Bino gets a disresptected regularly, and like GKMC this isn't for everyone, but the quality of this album can not be denied whether you like it or not. Although Bino has said himself he is just a rapper, he showed with this project that he is truly an artist.If you love story telling, artistic, risk taking, self aware artist, you need this in your life. To think Bino did a lot of the production only makes this that much better.Favorite tracksLife: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)Urn - Although just kind of a interludePink Toes3005SweapantsCrawl"
AF118RSWRJ1D6,B00FPM19UI,5.0,"I watched this as soon as I closed the door behind the UPS lady who brought it. I recommend it to any Nightwish fan and especially to any fans they lost because of Annette, their previous singer. Floor Jansen is 10 times better than Annette and at least as good as Tarja.It seems to be about half older Tarja stuff and half newer Annette stuff but Floor nails it all and leaves you begging for more. Floor has me excited for the next Nightwish album."
A2S8DZ2ZEPQ3L6,B00FPM19UI,5.0,"When purchasing Showtime Storytime, I wasn't sure if I would like it, but being a big Nightwish fan I knew it was a must. First...I really love Anette Olzon, her voice, her beauty, and she just worked for Nightwish's last 2 albums. Nightwish had to make minor changes to accomodate Anette's singing style, and it worked! It was just ashamed to had learn that Anette only lasted 2 albums. Second...I'm not a big Floor Jansen fan. I own a couple After Forever albums and ReVamp's debut album, and to me they're just so and so. Now don't get me wrong, Floor Jansen is beautiful and has a great voice, but I just never cared for the sound and style with her previous bands. So when the news came out that Floor Jansen was made permanent as the leading lady, I had no high hopes when purchasing this. After first watch and listen to this DVD concert, it was so AWESOME, I had to watch it again the next day! I knew Nightwish would perform excellent as always, but Floor Jansen BLEW me away! She sang each song with excellence and as if it was her own! Nightwish had never disappoint and this was no exception! I'm looking forward to there next album with Floor under the helm! I had purchased the 2cd/2dvd set, in excellent widescreen picture with a 5.1 surround sound. This was worth the pre-order wait!"
A2M52GKY2V6P5W,B00FQ5F5MC,5.0,"This is a wonderful album. The songs are varied in sound and the lyrics feed the intellect. The songs hold a lot of wisdom and really move me emotionally (Laughter Lines always gives me the chills). There isn't a song on this album that I do not like, and I have quite a few favorites. Typically, if one song pops up randomly on my MP3 player, I have to then go listen to the entire album. I would definitely recommend this version over the shorter one as the extra songs are very worth it. I can't really fault this album for anything.On a side note, I recently saw this band live and they sound just as great in person. Go see them if you get the chance."
A6PEUBK1WCM1F,B00FQ5F5MC,5.0,"In writing a concert preview for this band, I sampled the songs on this album and was blown away. Every track is strong and the bonus disc songs are well worth it, too. Sort of like the Thompson Twins--meets--Muse. All songs are catchy and Top 40 worthy."
AQ969QPG7OS78,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"This CD sucks, period. Vocals are lame, lyrics are pathetic, and music is just crap..........All I want is some great music from a once great band, not a political vegetarian promo. What a shame, once such a GREAT band........ At least I still have their first 2 albums to listen to......."
A1JOP899FR66X1,B00FR0GT9Y,2.0,"Not much more to add than what so many others have said.  Marginal music.  Horrible sound quality.  To have to wait ten years and then get this dumped on me was quite the disappointment.  The terrible sound quality is really shocking in this day and age, and inexcusable.  The songs sound like are all mastered from different sources and places.  I pre-ordered before I could read the reviews, and they are all correct.  I only gave it two stars because it is still &#34;Boston&#34;, but that is a gift.  Should have waited and saved the money...."
AQLG7X3TM23JP,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"Sorry Tom, I loved the first 2 albums but.....Without Brad Delp and with a really bad drum machine??? Really, it's sad."
ABTIAH9WOGQL3,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"This album is total garbage and should have never seen the light of day, sadely from someone that produced two brilliant and memorable albums...but that was a long time ago."
A2QW4YNZTHERR4,B00FR0GT9Y,3.0,"First off, very glad Boston produced new music.  Music usually takes time to really grow on you or fade out.  I gave it three stars for effort and I don't know if it'll hold up, but Tom and the band have put forth the effort and I appreciate that.  Every great artist has swings of creativity and they often don't know the impact or lack of.  Freedom is great.  We can say we really liked something or not, but constantly comparing everything they do to their first album is not beneficial.  Sort of like, &#34;Well, I think I'd like you if you looked and talked like you did in high school.&#34;  Same thing with Rush.  Dig the new stuff or let it go.  Give them credit for the efforts instead of vanishing with no new material.  Thank You Tom and Boston!"
A1WPNXAP6JM8K7,B00FR0GT9Y,4.0,I have listen to this band from the first day they came out.the first Boston album is a rock classic and should be a staple in any classic rock collection.So when I saw this LP I had to get it.Is it as good as the first three LP's I would say no. This is  why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5. Is it a good a disc YES.But lets face it the songs on that first Boston LP  are pretty hard to beet from ANY band out there.If you are a old rock dude or gal like me check it out.Tom Scholz still has one of the coolest guitar tones ever and to think he made all his  effects from scratch is a pretty cool thing as well.I'm not going to get into the deep discussion of tone or how the disc was recorded or bla bla bla of it.All I will say is it is a good revival from one of the best bands out of the 70's check it out it will be worth it I'm glad I got it.
A3QJAMEJZUPCXE,B00FR0GT9Y,2.0,"I am a Boston fan, having grown up with this group at a time when my older brother actually sported one of their graphic belt-buckles on his leisure suit (really).  Being a long-time guitarist (30+ years), I even owned one of the original Rockman X100's back in the day (wish I still owned it), so I am familiar with what goes into making music and owning a signature sound.  Anyway, I had high hopes for this album, given that most of what Sholtz put out after &#34;Third Stage&#34; was pretty lackluster (3rd stage being the beginning of the end), but at least each album up to Corporate America (boo!) contained at least a few memorable; dare I say &#34;decent&#34; songs.Needless to say, all the hype about &#34;Life, Love, and Hope&#34; (with Delp making a cameo from the grave) reignited my appetite for something finally worth buying.  Sadly, however; this album is nothing less than an exercise in due patience.  My wife (who also likes the band) was like: &#34;I hate to tell you this, but that album sucks,&#34; and she was right.  I just completed my second listen to this thing and I found myself constantly looking at the track counter on my iPod because I just wanted the pain to end.  Sholtz' over-the-top guitar orgy, steps all over the vocals and that droning high-hat of the drum machine literally drove me mad.Not only, but the instrument arrangements felt like a hodge-podge of overly-produced chaos thrown into the mix with very little of what is heard making any cohesive sense and the constant punishment of singing about &#34;love&#34; had the opposite effect, as I found myself hating the constant belly-ache of wussy-inspired lyrics more than I felt inspired towards giving somebody a big kiss.I thought about giving it one star, but there are two songs that are listenable, but where these two songs failed was via Sholtz's decision to add some kind of crazy, flamenco-eseque acoustic leads with odd time signatures over the chorus, drowning out the vocals and making my ears cringe.On the subject of vocals: give it up Sholtz, your voice is worse than mine, and that is pretty bad.They should rename this album: &#34;Hype, Blah, and No Hope&#34; because it is a total waste of time and money."
A1KUWSFYLDBXH6,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,Once upon a 1970's day a band released a self stitled album and it was a outright smash.  Biggest selling debut album of all-time I believe it was.  Then they did a follow up and it was another dead ringer classic.  Then about every 7 to 10 years they gave us another album progressively worse than the last.  Tom Scholz aka guitar perfectionist (aka OVER RATED) too little (material) too late.  Hang it up you haven't done anything good since Third Stage (and it was only good)
A768OB1LNE356,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"Oh man is this bad.The total lack of hooks is a crime against all that is/was right about Boston.  That which is Boston/Scholz has been flagging for years but this is brutal. I paid for it despite the reviews just to support the effort but I'm feeling ripped off at this point. This makes the recent crappy Hagar record look like a masterpiece.  This took 10+ years ? might be time to stick a fork in Boston. The magic seems to have left with Mr. Delp.  In the past with Fran and others singing it worked.  I even like Kimberly before but here ? fail.  Shoot, I just heard Brad and it still can't lift this sinking ship.EDIT: Docked a star cause after forcing myself to listen repeatedly, it still sucks."
A3VH08IPM7WN65,B00FR0GT9Y,4.0,"I wanted to spend a couple of days with the new Boston album before I wrote a review; but straight up I will say, upon first listen I was a little confused in parts. But as the day waned on, I listen to the album two more times... and once so far on the second day. Here are my findings:First off, all of the reviews that rant on what a steaming pile this album is are way off base in my opinion. I take serious issue with people that harp on albums being different and comparing it to albums that came out decades ago. &#34;Where's Smokin, More than a feeling and Foreplay/long time!?!&#34; they cry. Okay, seriously? And some of these guys claim to be musicians? So let's say these &#34;musicians&#34; recorded an album when they were 18 or 20 years old. Now, decades later when they are in their late 40's, or mid to late 50's... or even older, their musical tastes have expanded and grown. They release a new album that is really good, even great... and everyone just bypasses it and screams how they want the same sound the band had when they were 18! Does anybody else see the foolishness in this? Do people, of whom some claim to be artists themselves, actually want other people to stay the same for decades upon decades? How can people be so blind, selfish and closed minded as to never want an artist to grow, experiment and express themselves in new and fresh ways? Honestly, I put no stock in such people's reviews at all because it just shows the limited point of view from which they speak from.Now on to Life, Love and Hope... THE PROBLEMS WITH THE ALBUM: There are three songs on this album that were on their previous release. I can understand a good song getting a fair shake if it got the shaft in the past. But personally, I think there should have been more songs on the album to compensate for the material we have already heard before. I found this to be a bit of a lazy and cheap route to take and bit of a filler technique. I personally feel that Tom Scholz takes far too in making an album... and by the time he reaches its conclusion a billion years later, he suffers from creative and project burnout. Thus I feel the filler technique was a last minute, &#34;just remix some of these, put them on the new album and get it freakin' released,&#34; kind of moment.Tom also wrote every song on the album and played all the instruments... I think he should get some outside help and speed up the creative process. I feel he's getting a bit tired from laboring far too long on a project. And lastly, yes, the drums are recorded way below the rest of the music... Tom Scholz IS NOT a drummer. He needs to get the &#34;band&#34; back in Boston and get a more credible/stronger lead singer. Tom Decarlo is okay, but he cannot fill Brad's shoes... sorry.GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM: Over all, the album is not that bad. The melodies are catchy and the guitar and keys ROCK! I think Tom Scholz has been listening to Trans Siberian Orchestra lately and digging their sound. Just listen to the song, Last day of school, and tell me if you don't hear some TSO in that piano! I think the TSO sound kind of comes out in other songs as well, and just the way the album flows with the female vocals mixed in. There are some other influences here as well, and I think all in all  it comes together pretty nicely. I think the only song I personally dislike is, You gave up on love. There is still enough Boston sound here to let us know that we are listening to a Boston album, albeit a mellower Boston album with some creative splashes of sound here and there. I think this album would have been super stellar had they included a few more tunes and had someone like Brad Delp, (may he rest in peace,) or even Frank Cosmo doing all of the vocals. Boston needs to be a band again, but all in all Life, Love and Hope is a very good album with marks of greatness here and there... And by the way, I totally love the album cover!Rock on!!!!!"
A3VMCKYN22X0CO,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"I have to agree with most 1 star reviews. I have also been a big fan of Boston when I was growing up. I will only say one negative thing about this effort and that is, that there is nothing good about it."
A3RWAOPZTX9X23,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"i must say it was very boring  ,took out and said thats enough of that ,the only good is the folders cover ,the music goes nowhere...."
AHSF3CNWJPKTH,B00FR0GT9Y,2.0,"As a Lifelong BOSTON fan I have to agree with the majority here...this release was a major disappointment. When I first heard the title of it, I felt uneasy. But, being BOSTON I had to give it a try. The only positive thing I can say is how good it is to hear our old friend Brad Delp again. He Is missed very much. If you can avoid this purchase, do so!  I will give them another chance if a future release is done but I will do it with more scrutiny. Tom CAN do much better, that's a fact!"
A3PVKIMH1F9OI6,B00FR0GT9Y,4.0,"The thing I remember about every Boston album (except their debut) was that it always took way too long to come out, and that the albums were nearly always dissed as inconsistent.  Both criticisms were true - and they're true here as well.  It's not the old Boston, but it's Boston!"
A1LVQKTHWKGF9C,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,Just plain terrible! This sounds like a garage band with no passion left to rock and roll. It's officially time for Boston to change careers.
A3PDYRRLMS1UAL,B00FR0GT9Y,2.0,"having heard 'third stage', 'walk on', and 'corporate america', i was mentally prepared to expect a laid-back sounding boston album (compared to their first two albums, anyway). i'm OK with that (to an extent), since i do enjoy songs like \"hollyann\" & \"magdaline\" (from 'third stage' and 'walk on' respectively).....but truthfully, my problem isn't with the songs themselves, but rather the amateurish production. i know it's been repeated ad nauseum by others, but it can't be overstated enough: the drum sound on this album is so bush-league, i could get a better sound by smacking my sofa cushions with tree branches. even more dreadful, on many occasions, the drums don't even flow in sync with the music, and it just sounds plain awkward. i've gotta say, i've never heard an album (or demo, for that matter) where the drums absolutely kill the vibe as much as this one. such a shame, because beneath the muck, there IS some decent material there....and sadly, all other things remaining the same, even a present & accounted for brad delp wouldn't have been able to do much to save it."
A3S12XLVP6SD10,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"I really loved Corporate America...  That said, 3 songs previously released, really...  As for the rest, all three RTZ's, Delp Goudreau, Barry Goudreau albums are all better Boston music...  I have to wonder if you pushing being Veggie people has taken it's toll on you and your ability to show up for the game..."
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00FR0GT9Y,3.0,"And Tom Sholz, the notorious perfectionist, is wondering why folks aren't taking to new Boston albums with the fervor of old. He even blames the unspectacular reception given 2002's \"Corporate America\" on poor promotion instead of the fact that Boston's audience has simply moved on, so much so that there are three re-recorded or re-mixed songs from that album here, even a few featuring the late Brad Delp. Who was, frankly, a major brick in the wall of sound Scholz so prefers. So how does \"Life Love and Hope\" measure up? Let's just say that nobody will be giving up their copies of \"Don't Look Back\" for this one.The fault lies mainly with Scholz. He can spend as much time as he wishes in the studio, but the songs need to have a significant hook if he wants them to stick in the memory. On \"Life Love and Hope,\" it seems he forgot that part. He favors the trademark layers of guitars that are a hallmark of Boston's classic sound, and when it clicks (like on \"Someone,\" featuring Delp), it's \"More Than A Feeling\" all over again. It's telling that the best track does feature Delp, as the new singers are either imitations (Tommy DeCarlo) or the inappropriate female vocalist Kimberly Dahme, who doesn't have the powerhouse voice needed to propel herself above that wall of sound.What's memorable then? \"Heaven On Earth\" may be a cliche of a title, but it does kick the album off with fond reminisces of Boston past. \"Someday\" is noble in its intent, as a song against bullying. \"Te Quiero Mia\" is another retread (from the reissued Greatest Hits) and again features Delp, and also makes the best of Sholz's studio perfectionisms. After that, it's strictly hit and miss. I might add \"The Way You Look Tonight\" as a decent love song, and that's about it. Everything else will depend on personal tastes, or just how bad you're jonesing for Scholz's particular brand of classic rock. I'll even give the guy some bonus points for a decent production job, which studiously ignores the loudness wars for a recording that has some sonic depth to it. So if that is also an attraction for you to pick up \"Life Love and Hope,\" by all means, dig in."
A1X0H61Q6EAEBI,B00FR0GT9Y,1.0,"I thought about just copying and pasting my review of Corporate America... but that would be doing that album a disservice...this is worse.  All the negative reviews are right,  awful production, horrible drum sounds, terrible mix, bad songs.I have to think the album is a money grab as someone else said.  Unless he is now deaf,  there is no way the man who conceived Boston (the first album that is) could listen to this with any objectivity and not conclude at the very least that it is unfinished.  Regardless of the bad songs....and calling them songs is a stretch...  this album sounds simply awful.The negative reviews here are telling.  That fans are once again SO disappointed in another lackluster Boston album is only testament to the exceptional quality of the first album.  When you think about it, what has Scholz put out since 1976 that would leave you to believe that the next album will be better than the last?  Boston releases have been in a continual and predictable 37 year decline... we should all ask ourselves why we expect any different."
A21QY0C85NKYS2,B00FROW57K,4.0,Consistent is the best way to describe it. Their style.... Their mixture of different sounds... their great harmony.....it all adds to a typical LLB album. They are just too cool!
A1JW1VKFDNNFWO,B00FUABH02,5.0,"I have been a Cougar fan since the debut album with Small Paradise, I Need A Lover, Night Dancin', and many other fantastic songs.  All 19 of these cd's sound absolutely wonderful and John Cougar, John Mellencamp, or John Cougar Mellencamp, no matter which one you prefer, has had a fantastic career and has done a WIDE VARIETY of Music.  After listening to all of these cd's again I go back to my original beliefs:  COUGARS FIRST 5 ALBUMS ARE THE GREATEST OF HIS GREAT CAREER.  There may be 10 Million fans that disagree, but that will not change my opinion.  His early music is more Straight Ahead Rock and AMERICAN FOOL IS HIS GREATEST ALBUM EVER, IMHO!!!!!!  I am not saying that albums 6 thru 19 are bad, far from it, they are Fantastic also.  I Love all of the Cougar's music, but the first 5 were put out in my teenage years and therefore hold a Very Special Place in my heart and brings back some really great times with some really great friends and it is also SOME REALLY GREAT MUSIC!!!! Something for everybody in this wonderful box of Cougariffic Music!!!!!!!"
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H,B00FUABH02,5.0,"This box set includes EVERY ONE of Mr.Mellencamp's albums.All sounding top-notch! As I said,this is a must have for any John Mellencamp fan!"
A3RTSSKISUMMGV,B00FUABIGU,5.0,I&#8217;ve delayed writing this review because I am literally at a loss for words to articulate just how sensational this CD is.  Spectacular effort by Toni and Babyface.  The symmetry between these two is absolutely sensational.  It&#8217;s rare in the music industry these days that a project can crystallize so beautifully both conceptually and musically.  I won&#8217;t engage in a futile effort to pick favorite tracks.  The entire CD is stellar.  Toni and Babyface have raised the bar.  This is the high water mark for 2014.  It&#8217;s now incumbent on the buying public to demonstrate that creating great music should not go unrewarded.  To music lovers everywhere -- buy this CD!!!
A2ZVJ63VUZ7NMY,B00FUABIGU,5.0,I give this 10&#9734;s.  It has exceeded all expectations.  They couldn't have chosen a better title for this.  All of the music is superb.  &#34;I Wish&#34; was quite unique. Sort of I want to throw you off a bridge vibe.  I recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music.
AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00FUABIGU,4.0,"Before I start my review, I would like to say that this album isn't just for couples that are married and happy, married and going through things, married and on the verge of a divorce, etc.  Anyone that has been in a platonic friendship, a friends with benefits arrangement, a relationship, etc. can relate to this album in general.  This album deals with any kind of connection that you may have with the opposite sex.  In any friendship, relationship, marriage, etc. there will be good times, bad times and everything in between.  This is clearly summed up on the album's 1st track, &#34;Roller Coaster&#34;.  The ride will be bumpy, it will go up sometimes and it will come down sometimes.  You have no idea what can or will happen on a day to day basis.  This is one of my favorite songs on here.  &#34;Sweat&#34; deals with taking the argument the only place where it needs to go sometimes, which is in the bedroom, on the floor, or whatever you may prefer.  Taking out stress in other ways can help sometimes.  The lead single, &#34;Hurt You&#34;, is the best that I have heard from either artist in years.  When you hear the chemistry, you are reminded of their original duet from 22 years ago, &#34;Give U My Heart&#34;, which was featured on the &#34;Boomerang Soundtrack&#34;.  They are expressing their feelings in what becomes an ideal situation in some relationships and marriages these days and they do a good job of expressing their side in what happened in both of their eyes and you get both perspectives.  On Babyface's solo effort, &#34;I Hope That You're Ok&#34;, he is saying that he can't be in this relationship anymore but he still hope that she is Ok as possible with everything that has been going on.  He can't see the relationship lasting but he still wishes her well.  On &#34;I Wish&#34;, Toni doesn't feel the same way.  She is wishing ill will to her mate because of all of the pain that he has caused her.  Her tune may change in the future but as of right now, she has nothing positive to say at all.  She hopes that in his next relationship that his woman treats him the same way that he treated her.  &#34;Take It Back&#34; has them talking about taking things back to when they were happy and making love and trying to forget about their current situation that has them on the verge of ending everything altogether. &#34;Reunited&#34; focuses on the couple trying to get back to the basics of everything that made the relationship work in the beginning and trying to focus on the positive.  They are attempting to leave the negative behind and trying to make everything work the way it did before.  On Toni Braxton's 2nd solo track, &#34;I'd Rather Be Broke&#34;, she is in a state of mind where she just wants the relationship to end by any means necessary.  She'll do whatever she has to do to make that happen.  If she has to pay for the divorce, she is fine with that.  If she has to make concessions just so that everything can be over with and final, that is her goal at this point.  I was caught off guard by &#34;Heart Attack&#34; because I was expecting another ballad or mid tempo track.  They speed things up at this point as Babyface ends up randomly seeing a woman that he knows that he seems to know very well.  He gets closer to her and he realizes that it is his ex.  They go back and forth on the track, which is one of the better tracks on this album.  &#34;The D Word&#34; summarizes this CD in its entirety as the 2 parties know that they will always love each other in the back of their minds but they still have to contemplate whether or not it is time to really end things or to try to make things work one last time.In conclusion, you end up getting 11 tracks: 8 duets, 2 Toni Braxton solo songs and one Babyface solo track.  I can honestly say that this is the best that I have heard either artist in years.  If you are a fan of either artist and you have the majority of their work in your CD collection, this will be a welcome addition to your CD collection.  They don't deviate from the title of the CD at all but the work will speak for itself.Highsmith's Top 51) Hurt You2) Roller Coaster3) Heart Attack4) The D Word5) Where Did We Go Wrong"
A3MPM7PCLTBWXY,B00FUABIGU,5.0,With the first listen I was sold on this album. The two R&B legends voices really blend in together nicely .
A3W4D8XOGLWUN5,B00FUABIGU,4.0,"When it has came down to R&B; music of today, it has been overplayed by cheap and wasted songs from the annoying Beyonce' and the wasted Rihanna, where music has not mattered, and overexposure has to matter. For Toni Braxton, she has been out of the music scene for awhile and more of the focus has been on her reality show with her family reality show, Braxton Family values, and the spotlight has been more on Tamar Braxton with Love & War. That also can be said for Babyface, who discovered Toni Braxton and has shown a great smooth showmanship as a great songwriter for his work, and making works for the definitive Whitney Houston and TLC and producing for Toni as well, as the queen of his label LaFace with L.A. Reid. But fr both of them, it has been awhile since new music came from both of them. But hearing the two of them make new music together again as a duet record, seems worth the effort in heart, and mostly works its chemistry well.Love, Marriage & Divorce may be a throwback concept album to the 90's, but at heart there are some good songs here, focusing on the ups and downs of love and loss. The album seems basically short, but the heart is shown mostly well for both Toni Braxton & Babyface. Some songs work excellently like the lead single Hurt You, and Where Did We Go Wrong, where as the case some of the solo songs could work better in harmony and lyrics, like the fairly drown I Wish, where some of the lyrics lose you a bit in the heart, but the other solo tracks like I'd Rather Be Broke and I Hope That You're Okay work a bit better. For Babyface, he pens his work mostly well, and Toni shows it as well, over twenty years since Babyface and Toni first sung together on Give U My Heart from the movie Boomerang and off of Toni's debut record. As for Toni, who had a very good last album with 2010's Pulse, but was heavily unappreciated with radio, and a public battle announcing she has lupus, it is a welcome return to what her beautiful in the first place, great songs and a elegant heart.While Love, Marriage & Divorce might be considered a throwback 90's album, or a weak showing compared to today's music which has been more wasted than delivered, it is still a better album that harkens back to the lush R&B; smoothness of when songs did matter. If you have never heard either of Toni Braxton or Babyface's work before, you should go back and get one of their earlier records like For The Cool In You from Babyface, or the definitive Secrets from Toni Braxton and then get a listen to Love, Marriage & Divorce. But for those hard core fans of both Toni Braxton and Babyface, you'll definitely want to get a listen at this album.Album Cover: BSongs: B-Price: B 1/2-Mastering: BOverall: B 1/2-"
A1ILTWPB3VHLEK,B00FUABIGU,5.0,"In an industry where sales define quality music, most artists fear to release new records to avoid the mean critics by a new generation of fans and especially with the unfortunate motto - get dirty, curse & get attention. It requires a great amount of courage to stay real and put out authentic music from the heart without a Drake's verse or without promoting records with videos a la Miley Cyrus. This is exactly what Toni and Babyface did and the result is a pure soul album with deep emotions, smooth vocals and great production.Toni's contralto and babyface's smooth voices blend so well like vanilla and chocolates and one wonders why it took them so long to release a duet album.My top songs1. Reunited (this is the Babyface that I love - the production & the adlibs are soulful though it leaves you wishing for another verse... I keep screaming ooooh baaaaby)2. Hurt you (making it the 1st single was a smart move, it has a catchy chorus, a dope beat and people who went through bad breakups can relate a lot to this song)3. The D word (I could only play this Sade-inspired instrumental and just chillax all day... yet the song is amazing, simply an Adieu to an ex... that moment when you realize things will never work out, that it's not worth the fight anymore but you still wish them well because you can't deny he/she will always hold that special place in your heart (although the lawyer said to mail you, I'm still not over it!)4. I hope that you are OK (Face simply nailed this song with that 80s motown groovy beat a la Keith Sweat, this is def my jam!! Babyface makes divorce seem so cool #Oprah's quote)5. Sweat (the couple is tired of arguing and prefers taking it to the gym... They use fighting as foreplay and we get some steamy vintage sexual healing a la Marvin Gaye)6. I wish (Toni deservers a grammy for such a soulful performance, her voice is so smooth and carries emotions fueled with anger! The song finds Toni in that bitter zone where she wishes her ex-husband could catch aids or goes bankrupt; the song was written by Toni and inspired from her parents' divorce)7. Roller Coaster & where did we go wrong: talk about chemistry!!!8. Heart-Attack: what makes this album enjoyable is that the production went beyond clich&eacute; arrangement usually made for love songs. I salute Babyface for crafting such a particular jazzy, acid, groovy, crazy ass beat called \"Heart-attack\" reminiscent of the era of the Brand New Heavies. The funky techno will put you in that Saturday Night Fever or Virtual insanity mode.\"Take it Back\" is a decent song especially with that Sade's smooth feeling but I find the chorus very lazy and repetitive with that annoying Rihanna's \"oh na na\". I also did not dig I'd rather be broke, it sounds like an extract from Trey Songs' album.Almost every song is amazing. Toni was allowed more freedom compared to her previous work with Babyface whom confessed that she influenced the artistic direction of the project since she had different perspective of the love-divorce process as a woman.Love, Marriage and Divorce is a masterpiece, hope the Grammy folks will agree!"
A3J6PVOWS0YLQT,B00FUABIGU,5.0,"The finest R&B cd/album to come down the road in a few YEARS. In todays' R&B offerings that may not be saying much but this would stand the test against some of the best of the past. Great production, lyrics, and musicianship. Put it on and enjoy every song here, you will not tire of it."
ALHUWVAYR0K85,B00FWCFODY,5.0,"Ghost is Satanic, they are sexual, & they actually do it in an extremely fun way. They are very endearing, actually. If you can get past the fact they look like an evil version of the Catholic church & that they are led by an &#34;anti pope&#34;. They are an excellent band that has recorded some interesting cover tunes. My ONLY problem, is that their version of &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34; was not included. I look forward to seeing what they come out with next. Ghost will only get bigger in the next few years."
A2X7NBUETXC19E,B00FWCFODY,4.0,"Apparently not content with simply having released 2013's best album (Infestissumam), Papa Emeritus II and his band of Nameless Ghouls is back with another unholy offering. Alongside producer Dave Grohl (yes, that Dave Grohl, who also contributes drums and guitar on a couple of songs here), Ghost has delivered an EP titled If You Have Ghost, consisting mainly of cover songs. There are only five songs on the EP, so let's break them down individually:1. If You Have Ghosts - This is a cover of the Roky Erickson song, and it's handled brilliantly. It's as haunting as it is catchy, and is easily the best song on this EP.2. I'm a Marionette - This ABBA cover was previously available on the deluxe edition of Infestissumam, so chances are you've already heard it. Once again they bring out the song's hidden creepiness.3. Crucified - It seems odd that a Satan-obsessed Swedish metal band is covering an Army of Lovers song, but they definitely make it work. The raspy vocals on the verses are a stark and very effective contrast to the almost sweetly sung chorus.4. Waiting For the Night - Ghost turns in a fairly doomy version of this Depeche Mode classic. It's plodding and spooky, and surprisingly faithful to the original.5. Secular Haze (live) - This one seems like a throwaway track. It's not a particularly great recording, and it breaks the theme of the EP. Including a studio version of \"Here Comes the Sun\" would have made much more sense.Unless you're a serious Ghost disciple and collector, cherry-picking the three new songs in MP3 format may be the best way to go here, especially since the physical CD release of If You Have Ghost comes in a cheap, disc-scratching cardboard sleeve. Whatever method you choose, the three new cover songs are well worth hearing. \"If You Have Ghosts\" alone is worth the price of admission, and will quickly join the ranks of favorite Ghost recordings."
A2KHTX5ESCYECR,B00FXSIA10,4.0,"Ok as someone pointed out , this release is better than my original thoughts , great shows, few sound problems here and there , otherwise fun shows. I got a bad copy that was skipping there were visible manufacturing issues with my copy. Amazon easy to deal with replacing it."
A20RJXQWN251LX,B00FYTPKIE,5.0,"So great to have this finally released.  This band was so great.  And Maria McKee was the star and she tried to play along with Jimmy Iovine and his vision for airplay - but it was for naught.  Even though Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash were fans , and went to their shows, they didn't fit the bill for MTV and modern rock radio.  This band had so many line-up changes, that it's no wonder that they never made it.This album is where it all started, and had they stuck with the formula, regardless of the line-up changes, they would've been huge.  They were THAT good live!The beauty of this album is the purity of its intent.  Listen and be amazed at Maria McKee and the safety net this band provided that later line-ups would not provide."
A96GQNMC7BPC3,B00FZRMHDG,5.0,"Wow. This is my first Rosanne Cash album, and I am awed by the haunting beauty that pervades all the songs. Though I mentioned Southern longing in the title, I would be more correct to suggest that the songs convey the longing of the human heart. So many of the songs mention traveling, driving, wandering the world, and yet Memphis reappears again and again in the background. As I thought about these journeys through the South and even through the world, I begin to think of pilgrimage. A pilgrim traveling the backroads of the human heart expresses the human angst for relationship, home, and even God."
A2C7KJTVKHVFH3,B00FZRMHDG,4.0,"As usual, Ms. Cash brings a new and old tradition to the music.  Dark but mellow. Close to her Dad , She puts emphasis on the vocals and the musicians.  I love to listen to her.  She is smooth.  The lyrics are daunting!  Thank you R."
AZ22NJA3CRA39,B00FZRMHDG,5.0,"Her last album was incredible (The List).  I didn't think she could do it again if she wrote her own songs.  I was wrong.  Excellent lyrics, stunning guitar and easy to listen to."
A2JHO8NTRLE6LY,B00FZRMHDG,5.0,"first rosanne  cash i have purchesed, excellent.....what took me so long.....sit down and listen  good...very good............don't know what else to say other than the form says more words........good music....from the heart and the soul, mind, past lives.....................ej"
AET2Y6A8VJVLU,B00FZRMHDG,5.0,"There's some very warm, experience-laden music on this CD.  And it's the best I've heard from Roseanne in a very long time.  Her voice is far better than I expected from a lady who's had a rough life and been singing through it all for 40+ years.  The booklet makes it a real collector's item too."
A1NR90P458EN2D,B00FZRMHDG,5.0,"A solid album through and through.  Rosanne' voice is beautiful, excellent lyrics and musically delicious.  A talented family and a family of talent!!  Buy it today, it will make you glad !"
AX3WJZLFQQRCT,B00FZRMHDG,4.0,"While born in Memphis, Rosanne Cash was raised in Southern California. Only upon marrying Rodney Crowell did she live in Tennessee - and even then only for nine years.But Cash is big on her heritage, and while she made some country records, it was more the beginning of \"new\" country and not the traditional music of Wynette, Lynn or Wells. Still Cash clearly has 11 number one Country singles - though she will tell you she rebelled against Nashville.Yet with her album, the List and her newly released the River & the Thread (her first disk of original music in over seven years) she has more than dipped her toe into the waters of Country music - albeit more as an homage than to try to get back into that genre. Both albums were exploring her father's history to a certain degree, but on different levels.The thread, of which Cash speaks is a literal one of a sewing tutorial she took in Arkansas, but it is clearly a metaphorical one of her lineage to the South and the music that took her father from Arkansas to Mississippi to Tennessee. All of those types of music are played out here in one way or another.Cash has been covering Bobbie Gentry's \"Ode to Billy Joe\" in concert for the last few years and her admiration of that great artist clearly shows in two songs: \"A Feather's Not a Bird\" and the excellent \"the Long Way Home\" has more than a few tinges of Gentry's musical style. It works.But I hear a little Dusty in Memphis in this disk as well (\"Your Southern Heart\"). It sticks with the theme of the disk.The disk, overall, has strong material: I really like \"Modern Blue\", which is clearly the most 'rocking' song on the disk. But I'm completely loving \"World of Strange Design\", \"Tell Heaven\" and \"Money Road\" (a reference to Robert Johnson) a lot. It's very different for her, though a lot of this disk could be qualified that way.There are songs that are good - \"Etta's Tune\" about Johnny Cash's bass player, Marshall Grant and his wife. And I like \"Sunken Lands\", but there are major parts that are structurally reminiscent of her own \"Three Steps Down\" from Rules of Travel.\"When the Master Calls the Roll\". I find it most interesting she wrote it with her current and ex-husbands.I'm not a fan of \"Night School\" or \"50,000 Watts\". \"Biloxi\" is ok, but nothing outstanding. It is one of three \"additional\" songs on the deluxe edition. My problem with \"additional\" songs is that usually they're not strong enough for the standard release, so immediately they fall into a lesser category - perceived or real.Still, for me the centerpiece is really \"the Long Way Home\".  The bass. The strings and their arrangement (very Bobbie Gentry!). The vocal arrangement and phrasing has me repeating the song over and over and over.I love that Cash's voice is as strong, if not stronger, than when she started her career. At the very least she is more self-assured. I keep coming back to a line in that song that perfectly summarizes this disk and Cash's thread to not only her family but to a possible nod her early career as a Country artist: \"you thought left it all behind. you thought you up and gone. all you did was figure out how to take the long way home\".I also love that the cover art was a picture her husband, John Leventhal, took at the Tallahatchie Bridge....with his iPhone!!! Yes, there has been some \"work\" done to it since, but it fits perfectly.I'm struck by Leventhal's production, which can vary from album to album (or even song to song), but he strings his great thread through this disk as well. The arrangements and the music (both of which he did - Cash did the lyrics) are well done.There is a beef, of course. Purchased through iTunes is no digital booklet. I know there was one created and even talked about the extensive notes, so it's not like they had to create one for Apple. It's just not available and that totally sucks.I know it is early in the year, but this could easily be a contender for my album pick of 2014."
A3NVB6HKMUH2NM,B00G0RTMRO,5.0,"This is great music, my preferred listening is melodic rock and this fits into that description exceptionally well.  The songs are well prepared and performed, this may well become my favorite Magnum album but with so much great music from this group that will have to see how it stands up in time.Bottom Line:  If you liked any of their previous albums you will love this one."
A30FI0R0OJPAFZ,B00G2DC2EG,4.0,"I was looking forward to the package to find out things that I didn't have and to watch the DVD.  I did have most of the songs and I didn't really find any new discoveries but for the person who doesn't have Michael this is a very good package for them.  The DVD was a disappointment as I would have liked to see Michael playing more than seeing interviews.  Lastly, I think that Super Session and the Live Adventures of Bloomfield-Kooper are some of his best but there is a lot of really good stuff that didn't make this package. I liked it..........but it could have been better."
A1ESIA0UXNNB1A,B00G34XOQ4,5.0,"This is an amazing collection of Mary Chapin's songs, that brought me to tears. So glad she got to fulfill a dream, and that she shared it with us.  I can't wait to hear what she does next!"
A32JK6UA5YRJCM,B00G34XOQ4,3.0,"A collectible for Chapin's fans, the orchestration is lush and her voice is in fine shape.  Nothing new but then that's not what this album is about."
A3A0KPQ1458501,B00G34XOQ4,4.0,"The moment I saw that Carpenter was doing this collection andthat &#34;I Am A Town&#34; and &#34;Say It Was Only A Dream&#34; were on it,  I wanted it.She is a true artist and songwriter, so she has a lot of material that works perfectly with alarger, delicate, more formal arrangement.  But I have to only give it 4 starts out of 5 becausethe above 2 songs, to me, are the big &#34;stars&#34; here, and the rest of the album is not reallythat memorable.  The other songs all left me feeling that the orchestral version was just a&#34;different&#34; way to play them, but did not really bring anything new to them.  Whereason &#34;Town&#34; and &#34;Dream&#34;, the orchestra made excellent songs into simply overwhelminglymagnificent songs."
A75KTBJ4A1F4A,B00G34XOQ4,4.0,"This is a very good album.  I know because I finally gave up waiting on Amazon to deliver (even though I pre-ordered it) and bought it from iTunes, as an immediate download.  Carpenter is in great voice, the songs are slow and suit orchestral arrangements and it is good.  One day the CD will arrive (here in Australia) from Amazon and I can then report on the audio quality and packaging.  Amazon are usually pretty good, but this order was hopeless."
A39TJTPM64Q4UG,B00G3YTPQW,4.0,"What more can be said about 40's work ethic - he's a beast on the microphone and has a way of spinning new game into what's he's been speaking on for the last 20 years - he is one of the all time greats!  With that being said I would have liked to have given all three albums 5 stars because 40 is one of the dopest MC's on the West Coast, however, the beats on these latest albums are a bit lacking among other things.Now don't get me wrong, the beats slump hard enough to knock down my rear view mirror but there just doesn't seem to be enough variety in these latest cds.  There just doesn't seem to be &#34;that one&#34; this time around that captures the Bay or West Coast party sound that 40 has done in the past.  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that quite a few beats sound like they came off of a laptop and not out of a studio and are lacking the depth and layers of a classic 40 track.  I think if 40 went back to his old works and listened to the quality and uniqueness he would see a big difference.  I think one of the major things missing from these latest albums is the true mobb music sound and also the great production that Ant Banks used to bring along with Mike Mosely, Sam Bostic, Bosko and other earlier producers - we need that West Coast sound, that Bay Area West Coast sound.Further, the guest appearances seem to be less than stellar when compared to volumes 1, 2 & 3.  On the first volumes there were a wide range of old school Yay area & West Coast MC's (Dre Dog a.k.a. Andre Nickatina, Richie Rich, RBL Posse, Devin the Dude, Brotha Lynch..etc).  On these cds there's more newer rappers or non-West Coast rappers like Rick Ross, Gucci Mane, French Montana that really don't bring too much to the table if anything at all.  It would have been nice to hear more from the OG rappers and especially Bay area rappers like those mentioned above and/or Yukmouth, Dru Down, Celly Cell, and the original members of The Click, even the newer kids like Problem, YG or Dom Kennedy would have been great.  I give 40 much props for trying to propel these newer rappers into the game but at the same time keep the OG's in it to because it's us OG listeners that actually purchase the albums, unlike the newer generation that rips, burns and downloads without spending a penny.Overall 40 still knocks it out of the park with these latest albums because no other rapper is on his level.  40 has stayed heavy on the grind and keeps it real and it shows in his music - that fact that he's not doing stadium music like Jay-Z only makes him that much more real because he raps about what's happening in the streets and lays a blue print to the hustle.  Like 40 has said over and over again, he's a money motivator and inspires with his hustle.  Although 40 has done better previously, these 3 last albums of the Block Brochure are not too be missed and are a must have for any true 40 fan.For any newbie to 40 water - work your way backwards because his earlier works are all classics, especially In a Major Way and The Hall of Game, undeniable two of the greatest cd's ever to come out in the history of rap and truly untouchable works of art!A note to 40 - bring Ant Banks out of hiding and knock out another Player's Ball anthem and make one more Click album!"
A2R3WQIYRB4N9X,B00G47C4OI,5.0,"My wife and I are big fans of the series &#34;Sons Of Anarchy&#34;.  We own the DVD sets of Seasons 1 through 5, and we have Season 6 on advance order with Amazon.  As it is with many video productions, the music that accompanies the video leaves a lasting impression.  We have the CDs SOA 1 and 2, so it was only natural that we would purchase and love &#34;Sons Of Anarchy 3&#34; on CD."
A30G8SGUPL9XLE,B00G48OFXU,4.0,Great Christmas cd and love Leona Lewis.  I have followed her since her first CD and always hope for more!  If you like her you won't be disappointed in this one!
A2U49LUUY4IKQQ,B00G48OFXU,5.0,"This album features three original songs, a cover of a British Christmas rock classic, a cover of an American Christmas rock classic, and five Christmas standards that everybody has heard countless times before.The three original songs are One more sleep (a Christmas love song), Your hallelujah (in memory of deceased members of her family) and Mr Right. My favourite among them is One more sleep, which seems the obvious choice for release as a single.The five standards are Winter wonderland, White Christmas, O holy night, Ave Maria (the Schubert version) and Silent night. Leona performs them superbly and, like the other songs here, they have a contemporary production.The American rock classic, Christmas (baby please come home) was originally recorded by Darlene love for Phil Spector's Christmas album, which a lot of people are familiar with. I've heard several versions of the song, but while the original is still the best, Leona does a fine job with this song.The British rock classic is Roy Wood and Wizzard's I wish it could be Christmas everyday, which was a UK top 5 hit for them in 1973, since when it has been very much a part of British Christmases, although I don't think it has become popular in America. Apart from not using a children's chorus, another obvious difference in Leona's arrangement of the song is that she sings the first verse at a much slower tempo, with the rest of the song at the expected tempo. Still, it works very well.This is a great Christmas album by somebody I've not paid attention to, but will in future."
AXWFTQDX24GB8,B00G4EXNNM,4.0,"This album proves that Billie Joe would have been a rockstar in any decade... even the 50s or 60s. He has great harmony and control over his voice. The addition of Norah Jones is nice too, but I am a Greenday fan so that was the real draw. I also grew up on old music my parents listened to like the Everley Brothers so it was a good fit for me. There is nothing modern about this. The songs stay true to the style of music including morbid subject matter. It is good for an occasional listen but not necessarily one to put on the heavy repeat playlist."
A38Y4NA50TKEXC,B00G4EXNNM,5.0,"Good songs.  Great harmonies.  Dark content in the songs.  If you've enjoyed the &#34;Under the Covers&#34; series by M. Sweet and S. Hoffs, this will definitely appeal to you."
A2VOVZMI83Y7L6,B00G4EXNNM,4.0,"While the songs are not well known now days, it is a good selection from an earlier Everly Bros. album from a long, long time ago.  Voice harmonies are great and it even sounds a bit like Don & Phil.  Norah's voice is what you would expect if you have followed her for the past couple of years.  Billy Joe on the other hand is stretching out into some different territory.  Sounds good and should be in everyone's collection."
A37HOHQ8N366N9,B00G4EXNNM,2.0,very disappointed  mis reading the name. there is not song on the CD that I like  at all not one ...........sorry  .
A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00G4EXNNM,5.0,"What is it that drives musicians to revisit older music in older styles?  One could have asked that question of the Everly Brothers themselves when they recorded this music in the 1950's, for it was far from \"Cathy's Clown\" and \"Wake up, Little Susie\" and such songs as made them famous.  But Dylan, Van Morrison, and more recently Bruce Springsteen have recently (in the past 25 years) gone back to \"roots.\"  What did Stravinsky think he was doing when he started \"imitating\" neo-classical forms?  The sense of belonging to and respecting a tradition obviously matters to some people, and it's hard to see that an effort like this one will be a huge money-spinner (despite the comment from a one-star reviewer who sees it merely as a dollar magnet).  But the music isn't that glamorous , and it certainly isn't glammed up -- the arrangements are chaste and pretty minimal.  This is a blend of folk, country, and gospel, and it's got a distinctive texture.  Jones and Armstrong have a good feel for the style, their harmonizing is nice -- it doesn't try to ape the original sound of the two male voices (it couldn't) -- and it's good to hear.  The \"Barbara Allen\" is a distinctive take on an old ballad, presumably a Kentucky version.  There are maudlin heart-breakers like \"Put my Little shoes away\" that tell us something about the ways in which people thought it appropriate to appeal to feeling in certain times and places, and there is the wonderful \"Here to get my baby out of jail.\"  These are dark songs -- the prospect of death and loss, for the singer or the subject of the song, is always present.  These are the great unavoidables of life, and this music acknowledges that.  The record is an homage to the Everlys, but more important it is, as the original Everly album was, an homage to the music and the ways of life it sprang from."
A5A2QE6NECFR5,B00G4EXNNM,4.0,"It's a lovely production. A casual listener might even mistake Billie and Norah for  Phil and Don on a couple of tracks. If there is a weakness, it's that too many of the songs are sad, slow and reference natural death or killings. But they recreated a real 1958 LP, so they couldn't stick in a couple of more like &#34;Roving Gambler.&#34; As it is, the 45 minutes you'll spend with this exposes you to beautiful harmonies, and for most of the younger buyers, unfamiliar songs that have been around anywhere from 75 to 200 years. This arrived at my house today as a gift from a friend, and I'm glad to have it. I have been a fan of the brothers since they first recorded, and a fan of Norah since her first CD. I was unfamiliar with Armstrong, but have to say I am impressed with him."
A2LJ1M369ZQB7R,B00G5JCFEE,5.0,This album is worth every penny. The first three songs kick you ass and it just gets better from there. Jake has not lost his step. Get the album.
A2X7NBUETXC19E,B00G5JCFEE,5.0,"After way too many years away, former Ozzy Osbourne/Badlands guitarist Jake E. Lee is finally back with a new hard rock project, titled Red Dragon Cartel. Lee is joined by bassist Ronnie Mancuso (Beggars and Thieves), drummer Jonas Fairley and vocalist Darren James &#8220;DJ&#8221; Smith. The band&#8217;s self-titled debut also features guest vocals by Robin Zander (Cheap Trick), Paul Di&#8217;Anno (ex-Iron Maiden), Maria Brink (In This Moment) and Sass Jordan.If you were worried after the blues exploration of his last solo collection or that he might be rusty after so many years out of the spotlight, Lee and company put those fears to rest quickly with the one-two punch of &#8220;Deceived&#8221; and &#8220;Shout it Out.&#8221; This is definitely a hard rock record, and one that hits just the right balance between the classic hard rock Lee is known for and a more modern rock energy. It&#8217;s fun without being cheesy, has fantastic hooks and melodies, packs a huge rhythmic punch, and is just so well written and executed all-around that you can&#8217;t help but turn it up and sing along. Smith gives a very strong vocal performance, and the various guest singers add a nice variety to the album, with Zonder and Jordan&#8217;s turns on &#8220;Feeder&#8221; and &#8220;Redeem Me&#8221; stealing the show.Red Dragon Cartel doesn&#8217;t sound like Ozzy and they don&#8217;t sound like Badlands, but there&#8217;s more than enough on this album that fans of either (or both) bands ought to love. Jake E. Lee&#8217;s return is long overdue, and he definitely came back with style. If you&#8217;re a fan of hard rock &#8211; whether that&#8217;s old or new &#8211; with first rate guitar work and some standout vocal performances, the Red Dragon Cartel debut is a must-have album.Disclosure - I was given a copy of this CD by the label for review."
AAR77T6K4X3XZ,B00G5JCFEE,5.0,"I have always wondered as I&#8217;m a fan of Jake Lee since the earl 90s both his time with ozzy and badlands why is it that his inactive and whats the wait for .. now I know that Jake was taking his time to return with this killer debute and what an album it is this is the second killer album that I have bought the first was adrenalin Mob it&#8217;s a same that portony left but that was a killler album and then KXM and now this what an album if your looking for hard rock killer riffing, best of the best vocals, and one hell of a rhytem section this is the album you been waiting for as with every legend from the hair metal era this is what real metal about and believe me you cant stop playing this cd &#8211; do your self a favor and hit the repeat boton from the start .. rock on \\m/"
A7AWAIVOA1IVR,B00G5JCFEE,5.0,Jake E. Lee has still got it.  His guitar still stings when you listen to this album.  Love it and so will you.
A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2,B00G5WK5YS,3.0,"While the previous records were promising and I liked them a lot, this recording was expected like the Second Coming, and a little bit like the Stone Roses record it is a disappointment. It is clear that success has gone to their heads and that they are resting on their laurels. Probably too much was expected of them. The problem is that this is very very derivative and has been done like 25-30 years ago by bands that did not reach their level of fame. It is pleasant but not the expected masterpiece."
A32LG2T9DK2LP3,B00G5WK5YS,5.0,I read a review and heard some of their music on NPR.  I came to amazon to preview more of the titles and was pleasantly surprised by the musicianship and songwriting.  The creativity on display shows that WARPAINT has a lot of good music to come.  I like this album and look forward to future offerings from the group.
A1SANB57D9U31P,B00G6MW63K,5.0,"Great recording, best rendition of Time is Running Out, in my opinion at least. The rest are just average, though of course average Muse is still amazing. Less flashy than the HAARP, Hullabaloo, Absolution recordings, which is a nice change. The stage is nice, though I rather like their normal pyramid stage. There are miniperformances onstage, though, which is an awesome addition."
A2WEH6H5AGO94E,B00G9C27N6,4.0,"No one who has ever heard Ronnie Milsap's hit covers of Don Gibson's \"(I'd Be) A Legend in My Time,\" Al Dexter's \"Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry,\" Roy Orbison's \"Crying,\" Chuck Jackson's \"Any Day Now,\" Joe Henderson's \"Snap Your Fingers,\" the Skyliners' \"Since I Don't Have You,\" or of course his own Grammy-winning performance of \"Lost in the Fifties Tonight\" (based on the Five Satins' \"In the Still of the Nite\") - not to mention his entire 2004 album \"Just for a Thrill\" - would be the least bit surprised that the now 71-year-old Milsap could come up with such a fine, soulful and nostalgia-drenched piece of work as this (which he also co-produced).The opener, the newly written nostalgia-themed title song \"Summer Number Seventeen,\" is the mission statement here, as Ronnie takes us on a most enjoyable tour of pop and R&B; hits of the late'50s (Tommy Edwards's \"It's All in the Game,\" Little Anthony & the Imperials' \"Tears on My Pillow,\" Lloyd Price's \"Personality,\" Bobby Darin's \"Mack the Knife\") and soul and pop hits of the '60s (his idol Ray Charles's \"Georgia on My Mind, Mack Rice/Wilson Pickett's \"Mustang Sally\" [with excellent added blues guitar], Jimmy Ruffin's \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\") and '70s (the Stylistics' \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\" as a duet with Mandy Barnett).  These remakes are all very agreeable, with the two best, in my estimation, being \"It's All in the Game\" and \"Georgia on My Mind,\" which sound the most inspired vocally; but don't expect any of these to match the dynamism and (as redundant as it may seem) originality of the originals.  For me, the most essential track is his sole country cover here, of the 1951 Hank Williams standard \"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You).\"  Injecting his soulful pipes into country songs is what made Ronnie Milsap a durable superstar.  On this one he delivers a double dose of heartbroken reflection and melancholy.A second duet with Mandy Barnett, the '70s-\"soft-rock\"-sounding ballad \"Make Up\" wraps up the newly recorded material; but as a bonus track we get the perfect closer to this album, the taker-of-the-cake of all nostalgia-for-the-oldies-based hits, the aforementioned original recording of his #1 smash \"Lost in the Fifties Tonight.\""
AA762OWLWCPQ2,B00G9C28SK,5.0,"I cannot understand why some are calling this album dull and cliche'd. I heard someone say one time that all a cliche' is is really something that is repetitiously said over and over but its because our hearts get so dull that we need these reminders again and again amen? Okay I admit lyrics do get recycled at times on casting crowns songs but to me its much better than the merely 'just believe in something' type Christian music. It starts out with 'Thrive', a very nice banjo, acoustic country sounding piece that reminds me of their last studio album Come to the Well which to me isn't a bad thing.It Continues with 'All You've ever Wanted' which is one of my most favorites on the record next to 'This Is Now'. It really demonstrates the need for Christians everywhere to stop trying to impress God with their trying to be spiritual and just lay it all at the feet of Jesus.'Be Held' is another dear favorite of mine and also 'Love You With the Truth'. The latter is so important in our crazy day world today because if love for one another isn't embraced in the truth of God's Word...it just comes off as being corny and superficial and ultimately meaningless. Truth is vital to loving people the way God wants us to love them.Now for the music side....it does, like mentioned above delve a little into country realm especially track 9 'follow me', but for the most part...it continues with the classic sound Casting Crowns has had on their past records. Maybe a little 'too rocky' for some, but i liked it...but then again if you hate the sound CC has had from 'Until the Whole World Hears' not much will change your mind.As for the message, which to me is the most important aspect of Casting Crowns....oh boy...awesome!!! i can feel the spirit moving on this record and Casting Crowns just nails it for me here. It may not be a smash hit album but to me it could be revolutionary album if folks are willing to listen with their hearts and not just their ears."
A3582CZXSZR7EN,B00G9C28SK,5.0,I like religious music and I like the beat of thrive.  It is an excellent album.  I loved it. Amen
A1IUSWIWF7087C,B00G9JKP42,5.0,Ledisi delivers another soulful blend of love songs with uptemo Ballads that makes couples fall in love all over again. very sesnual and very erotic that has her listeners falling for lust and desire.

ALNAXN9SFT7BB,B00G9JKP42,4.0,This is a great CD but I think it will have to grow on me. Pieces Of Me was a hard CD to follow up on so I can't say that this one is bad but it will have to grow on me. It does sound like whoever is writing the songs on this album has or is currently going through the ups and downs of love. Either way I am an avid Ledisi fan and will be putting this in rotation for a while.
ADDAPWAZXUI1U,B00G9JKP42,4.0,"I just love Ledisi's voice.  The woman can sing her a-- off, however, I wasn't sure where the music was going?  One song sounded as if she was trying to do a Beyonc&eacute; impersonation.  You don't need to go there because you attract a different and more mature audience with you voice and talents.  Outside of the strange music, Ledisi still aims to please with this CD."
A2IMQG6JCK6PN3,B00G9ZZJAQ,5.0,"It's in my car, I listen to it all the time. I just love it. The talent is amazing. Great buy."
A2FO24JT0RM91P,B00G9ZZJAQ,4.0,"ABC&#8217;s Nashville has become more than a guilty pleasure. Its Nielsen numbers make it a legitimate nighttime soap opera. Following suit, the soundtrack has become a bonafide chart spoiler. It has eclipsed the wildly popular Hunger Games at No. 4 on the Billboard chart. Nonetheless, much like this season&#8217;s plot lines, the soundtrack feels fragmented.  Thie heavy handed treatment of the script is not reflected in the score. Rayna (Connie Britton) is placed in a medically induced coma after a car accident, Upstart stud Will Lexington (Chris Carmack) struggles with his sexual identity and commits suicide.  But the show must go on. Hayden Panietierre (sexy crossover brat Juliette Barnes) provides ample  eye and ear candy with tight clothes and  the glossy pop on Trouble Is and Can&#8217;t Say No To you The former is aptly titled and refers to her affair with a multi-millionaire whose marriage she broke up. She freezes onstage when fans hold up a &#8220;Homewrecker&#8221; sign.Britton has said the biggest challenge of her role as aging superstar Rayna James is to give the impression that she has been country music royalty her entire life. While it is quite a stretch, a woman with no public singing experience has more than held her own vocally and does so again here on the rocker Ball and Chain. All cast members sing their own parts. While Britton and Panettiere shine out front, the true gems lie in the supporting cast. Claire Bowen&#8217;s (Scarlett O&#8217;Connor) lilting soprano mesmerizes on solo numbers and covers any inadequacies in on duets.The cover art features the two rivals seated closer together while looking away from one another with disdain. The album is good, clean fun.  Its critics have labeled the show as cheesy and the music superficial. It would be no surprise if a few select tracks were found on their Ipods.for full magazine GO TO: [...]"
AUO1ZDJCAJCUG,B00G9ZZJAQ,4.0,I like the Nashville series and especially the music that comes out of it.  I recognize the quality expertise behind the music and appreiciate the acts that the show is bringing to this season.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants music that really tells a story

A2RMWJEGN2G5XV,B00GALB44Y,5.0,"I really love that Bloodgood speaks of our Lord Jesus Christ and God's teaching loud and clear through their music. I hope they will continue to bring the message to metalheads that might never consider getting to know God any other way. Keep it heavy and stay blessed, guys!"
A2M4P9328NMD6A,B00GALB44Y,5.0,"A super strong comeback album is better than expected.  This veteran Christian metal pioneer band, has blazed the trails for the many righteous metal bands to follow. The production is this album is amazing, along with the talents of the band as a whole. It is more metal than a steel beam at a construction site."
A2KT3DANHRTI38,B00GALB44Y,5.0,"I used to listen to them back in the 80's. They had some great stuff back then. I was shocked when I saw they had a new album, so I just had to purchase. Really good album. The lead singer sounds really good still, and they have some great songs on this album. Oz Fox from Stryper plays on this album too, so its got to be good! I think its a really good album, and worth getting."
A2TY3TKG8E1H1Q,B00GALB44Y,5.0,"Bloodgood is back in classic form with their first studio album since 1991.  Several of the arrangements are the most progressive and staccato since their first two albums in '86 and '87.  The personnel includes the second lineup from their classic rock days - Les Carlson on vocals, Michael Bloodgood on bass, Paul Jackson on guitar and Kevin Whisler on drums - along with a new second guitarist in the person of Oz Fox from the band Stryper.  Bloodgood's original guitarist and now successful Nashville producer David Zaffiro also helped collaborate, doing the final mastering.  It's ironic that on this album the classic rock lineup of Bloodgood has been able to reach back and reclaim some the best qualities from their progressive metal days.  The album sizzles from start to finish with aggressive melody lines, layered guitars, tasteful breaks and musical sensibility.  It's possibly the best album the band has ever made.  If you are a fan of white metal, classic metal or hard Christian music, give this album a listen."
AOTON0WIC9O9M,B00GC2KHJ4,4.0,"While Primal Fear doesn't exactly branch out much from their signature sound, they do what they do superbly. And, yet again, another new  album that delivers. I will admit it's not may favorite. To me, it doesn't compare to Black Sun or 16.6. I think those are the band's top albums. But you can't go wrong. Highlights are &#34;When Death Comes Knocking&#34; and &#34;One Night in December. It's a more &#34;mellow&#34; album compared to the last few. If you're a PM fan, or a fan of power metal in general, grab this now."
A2BARLFJXPTV24,B00GC82DEK,5.0,"I love that Jamie &#34;Amazing&#34; Grace helps me enjoy a BEAUTIFUL DAY with her joy-filled praise to God! I begin and end each day to the backdrop of BEAUTIFUL DAY. It brings me so much joy, no matter how my day is going or has gone.Get READY TO FLY and enjoy a great CD!"
A370LEGDL7SL3N,B00GC82DEK,5.0,"Ms. Grace is a wonderful musician that can cross all the lines in the industry.  The songs on this album can make my children dance, make me sing, and my mother smile.  There is a little something for everyone, where you favor pop, reggae, hip hop, country, she's got it covered.  Her down-to-earth style makes her likable to just about anyone.  This is a little more 'poppy' than her first, but it is still fabulous!  She is so talented, whether she is playing piano or strumming the guitar,  and I like listening to her praises with my children.  It inspires them, as well as me.She is a fantastic role model, and my girls love 'Every Bit of Lovely', which really does show that being yourself as a young woman is best, rather than following the latest trends.  'White Boots' is a lot of fun and another shining example for young women!'Beautiful Day' is a great start-the-day kind of song. It makes me want to 'get my worship on'! It is also great if you are having a hard day, and need to turn it around. I look forward to more music from Ms. Grace, I have enjoyed all of her music so far. This is a great way to praise God and make Him a part of your life!My favorite song is 'To Love You Back', it is a whimsical love song to our Lord.'One Song at a Time' was a wonderful album, and this is a fantastic album, as well.  Her 'Ready to Fly(Avery's song)' transition from her first album is beautiful and fun.  I really can't sing enough praises for her second release, and look forward to more!"
A7YZQW5WJEXGN,B00GC82DEK,5.0,Am enjoying her songs.
A3QJ43QJ565I41,B00GC82DEK,5.0,"&#34;Ready to Fly&#34; is Grace's best album yet, and I'm greatly anticipating her next albums. Her voice has matured and the song lyrics are powerful! I especially love the couple of songs on here that talk about waiting for her future husband. :) Fantastic album...I love Jamie Grace."
A26U8WHGDCVJO1,B00GCV9S3Q,4.0,I found them to be an energetic new style of harmonies and good music. They have an interesting new sound.

A1YDS4TUIGDPUG,B00GD23ROK,5.0,"I loved this album! How have I never heard of Neil Finn? Reading about him on Wikipedia, I feel he's like the Paul McCartney of New Zealand. I discovered Neil Finn while watching Later... With Jools Holland on Palladia. He did Dizzy Heights on the show, as well as Flying in the Face of Love, I think. So I sampled other songs here on Amazon, and they all sounded like something I might want to hear more of. As it turns out, I love most every song on the album. The sound is indescribable to me. If I were to describe it as a mixture of the early BeeGees and the Yardbirds, I'd probably be way off. That is just an impression. I now listen to this CD practically every night before going to bed. It's certainly a very relaxing sound, and it has some very interesting lyrics. But musically these songs are perfect. Everything seemed to come together just right, which tells me its an inspired album. I read that two of his sons, Elroy and Liam, I think, also play on the album. I get a warm feeling just thinking of a father being able to make music with his two sons. His wife also plays on the album, I believe. My favorite songs are the two I mentioned, as well as Impressions, Recluse, and In My Blood. But really, there's not a bad song on the album."
A2SLU95PON3BQ0,B00GD23ROK,5.0,"I am a huge fan of Crowded House. Dizzy Heights has diversity with samplings sounding similar to Crowded House, Pink Floyd, Arcade Fire, and other styles. Every song is very good to Outstanding."
AMW1OYXWOGZGJ,B00GFXRKHW,5.0,"I bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  I listened to it with her and like it, too...  I'm not much of a country music lover,, but found this to be some good music!"
A1PPYGCSIYSVPT,B00GFXRKHW,3.0,"YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. You definitely won't love this album, and you might not even like it. He went for too much change, too quick. A lot of moments on the album are even borderline weird. I don't even know which song they'll pick for the next single ...probably the mediocre &#34;Talledega&#34;? Besides that and &#34;Give Me Back My Hometown&#34;, I'm not really sure anything will be radio-friendly enough. Eric has gotten so wrapped up in pushing his bad-boy, rebel &#34;Chief&#34; persona that he's leaving behind the fans who got him to where he is today.It's easily my least favorite of his four studio albums, and it leaves me really missing his &#34;Sinners Like Me&#34; and &#34;Carolina&#34; days."
A2EU8DIADYOWFG,B00GFXRKHW,5.0,"I can not say enough good things about Eric Church. I am a big fan and was not disappointed by his new album. I like the rocking style of the outsiders, but its also an awesome change to hear him do some of the softer songs. He sticks to his reputation of getting rowdy but this is also a great album to put on and have a few beers and hang out to."
A26G78BOOCTP69,B00GFXRKHW,1.0,"This cd does NOT even compare to his Chief cd.  This cd is slow and draggy.  I wish I hadn't bought it but thought if it was as good as his last cd, I would be okay.  It as a real chore to listen to every song but I wanted to see if there were any good songs on it and couldn't wait until it was over.  Damn Rock n Roll is the best song on there and the only one I would listen to again.  Eric Church has done better!!!!!!!!!  Really sorry I bought this cd.  I would NOT recommend this cd to anyone."
AUU2OT4F5G5D,B00GFXRKHW,3.0,"You can practically smell the testosterone coming off this CD.  Church abandons all pretense of being a country singer and goes for the straight-ahead, kick-ass rock & roll that will likely be his style henceforth.  While all of this material sounds genuine, some of it simply tries too hard to establish the outlaw credentials that Church so craves.  The title track, \"Talladega\" and \"The Joint\" are my current favorites but it's not likely I'll want to hear \"Prince of Darkness\" repeatedly.  Church has said this CD should be listened to as a whole and not as individual songs.  Unfortunately, while his first three albums were a pleasure straight through from start to finish, you'll likely find yourself cherry picking your own favorites here instead of listening repeatedly to Church rail against the Nashville establishment.  Still, when all is said and done, there's that wonderful voice that makes Church a pleasure to listen to.  Clearly he's not reluctant to throw over preconceptions about what country music is or should be, but it would be better if he didn't pose so much and try so hard."
A2D6116RCCEYHM,B00GFXRKHW,5.0,This album was his best yet! I love the traditional sound with the twist of southern rock he has found. I hope he continues to produce this type of music. It will easily propel him to the top of my favorite singers list.
A25V9EB0D4M7MH,B00GFXRKHW,3.0,"I haven't purchased this CD yet, but after listening to the sample tracks and reading reviews, I honestly doubt that I will buy it.  I've been a fan of Eric's music since his debut of 'Sinner's Like Me' and I have ALL of his music since his debut.  I was expecting something much more from him since his music has progressed and become more mature and better with time.  I have to say, this is not what I expected or enjoyed at all.  There were maybe a couple of songs I could easily listen to but the rest of the songs were not good at all!  What happened Eric?  You finally reach the pinnacle of success because of your unique sound and great lyrics, only to release an album of utter crap!  You are trying way too hard to be a hard rocker country guy but it's not working.  I'm really glad I read the reviews and listened to the sample tracks because this is the only Eric Church CD that will not be in my collection.  SAD!"
AOVCVSNCVUUC6,B00GG4E6XG,4.0,"I am very happy to see the missing soundtrack albums not otherwise available such as: It Happened At The World's Fair, Kissin' Cousins, Harum Scarum, Spinout, Double Trouble, and Speedway.Still missing are: EPs not included are Love Me Tender, Tickle Me (and Tickle Me vol 2 if you count the UK release) and Easy Come-Easy Go. Other soundtracks not included: Wild In The Country, Live A Little-Love A Little, Stay Away Joe, Charro, The Trouble With Girls and Change Of Habit. So at least one star has to be deducted.  Hey, they even included the distortion on Blue River as originally released, as well as the brief dropout on the left channel of You Don't Me. Other defective artifacts are intact here and there. Now that is historic accuracy at its finest!"
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B00GH0QOJ8,5.0,"I really enjoyed this sophomore effort from Broken Bells, which is the collaboration of Danger Mouse and The Shins frontman James Mercer.  While the 2nd half of the album lost a little bit of energy, the front half has several outstanding tracks.  There some similarities here to the way that Daft Punk used disco beats and themes on 2013's excellent &#34;Random Access Memories&#34;, except that the arrangements and vocals here are totally unique.  If you are fan of other indie/alternative groups that have synth/electronica influences (heavy parallels to Cut Copy came to mind), there's a lot to like with this album.  I actually think I prefer it as an overall album to their debut effort."
AG6TX1ZJHLMO7,B00GH0QOJ8,5.0,"I owned the first Broken Bells album and thought it was so so.  I was no rush to buy the second album until I saw the video for Holding On for Life.  This song suddenly started showing up everywhere and I knew that I would be buying the album.  There is not one song on this album that I would not want to hear again and they are all as well done as Holding on for Life.  Danger Mouse really has a strong presence on this album, in fact my wife asked me if I was listening to Danger Mouse when she first heard this album.  Second favorite song is After the Disco and the third Leave it Alone.  This really is a strong album from top to bottem and did not disappoint.  A rare case where the second album is better than the first."
A1A1WCAIEOBZCR,B00GH10BU0,5.0,"This combo CD/DVD is the best value in music available, in my humble opinion.  Hands down, best compiliation produced by Jon Schaffer in his entire esteemed metal career.  Iced Earth keeps getting better with every album, and Plagues of Babylon is yet another gem in the metal crown.  For the turntable listeners, be sure to pick up the vinyl mix as well.The DVD is fantastic with documentary, multiple mix versions of the album songs, and plenty for audiophiles to drool over.If you have never listened to Iced Earth, Plagues of Babylon will make you an instant fan.  Schaffer's powerful rhythm guitar, singer Stu Block and guest vocalist contributions are perfect on every song, Troy Seele lead guitar solos will blow you away, and Luke Appleton's bass riffs and rhythm, as well as the entire rhythm section, are all full of fantastic surprises.  All the lyrics and special song versions at the end will have you singing along on every song.There is a reason why Iced Earth has the most loyal and enthusiastic metal fans in the entire world, and Plagues of Babylon will illustrate why.  Be sure to catch the live shows on the Worldwide Plagues Tour in 2014.  Your spirit will be regenerated every time you enjoy Iced Earth.Like a really great movie, listening to this album over and over will reveal all the treasures it holds; PRECIOUS METAL!"
A3TI4CL2MJ5V8L,B00GH10BU0,4.0,"Heavy. I like hearing Shaffer ring out the chords in the opening intro - he did this very well in Imhotep (Horror Show) and here, and is a nice departure from the machine gun picking. Heavy bass. Bass drums. Vocals are low end and may take a few listens to appreciate. This album should draw the line between candy ass rock and straight up in your face power metal. When one of your pals wants to pop in some A7X or something, have them listen to this instead, and then put them on suicide watch - keep em away from sharp objects!  When you listen you'll hear it. Any of these songs will translate well live. Saw them on Dystopia and they blew it away, and plan on seeing this tour also! One of the best live bands! Buy it and see the band."
A32TB8AQYVRMSH,B00GH10BU0,5.0,"(Since there are no half stars I mark this as 5)Plagues of Babylon&#8230;ICED EARTH continues in the right direction:In 2007 I came across ICED EARTH on YOUTUBE. Up to that point nothing in the heavy metal world was doing anything for me at all. I was still listening to Maiden and excited about the new material they were putting out, but outside of that&#8230;it just wasn&#8217;t happening. So when I came across IE I was excited and disappointed at the same time. I was upset I had not come across them earlier than I did, but excited that they had quite a few albums that I could dive into and they had this AMAZING singer in Matt Barlow. So when I found out he wasn&#8217;t with them anymore and they had RIPPER singing for them I was a little let down because I loved what I heard in Barlow and didn&#8217;t think Ripper was a good replacement. To me, it was like when Maiden replaced Bruce Dickenson with Blaze Baley. It was a good attempt&#8230;but MAN&#8230;none of the albums compared to what made the MAIDEN name. Then I heard Barlow was coming back and like many IE fans&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t wait&#8230;but the love affair would be short lived. A new singer was on the way and what were the IE fans going to get???In walks Stu Block. WOW! I was so PUMPED when I heard Dystopia. He was like a cross between Barlow and Ripper, but he was making his own stamp on IE. So now on to Plagues of Babylon&#8230;the 11th studio album from Iced Earth and the second with Stu Block.As we neared the end of 2013 we were getting some great tastes of what was to come&#8230;and I was very excited and wondered what the new album would mean for Iced Earth and its fans and even their mark on the heavy metal community.Before I do a song-by-song review let me say this&#8230;PLAGUES of BABYLON is one of my favorite Iced Earth albums!! Something Wicked This Way Comes is still my favorite with Dystopia and now Plagues of Babylon being tied for second. I am still just blown away by how great Stu&#8217;s voice is and where he is taking Iced Earth&#8230;I am in awe. Okay now for the album itself. As you may know, the first half of this album deals with the whole Something Wicked Saga with the last half being stand-alone songs.:Plagues of Babylon: 5 out of 5 stars. Song has a typical heavy metal long intro getting you pumped for what is in store as a heavy metal drubbing. Stu&#8217;s voice comes out strong with chunking guitars and heavy bass and drums in the background. Around the 4 minute mark I am reminded of DAMIEN from HORROR SHOW when Barlow starts talking from the point of view of Damien. After that the galloping guitars and heavy metal chaos ensues. Different changes and tempos and then Stu comes back swinging ready to take you down. Great track!Democide: 4.5 out of 5. Pounding drums to continue your ear drum beatdown start this track off. Guitars join in and then at the 1:10 point your heavy metal arse kicking commences. That goes on for about half a minute and then Stu joins in and lets you know that this song needs an even bigger set of gonads. His strong voice is joined with the high screaming that he is known for, dubbed in the background. The screams aren&#8217;t so much in the forefront, but they are evident and it is very nice and clean. I like it. Very good track that sets you up for the next.The Culling: 3.5 out of 5 Stars. Good opening. Strong chunking guitars. Reminds me a little of JACK from their album Horror Show. Overall a solid track, but nothing really stands out as, &#8220;OMG!!! This is just FANTASTIC!&#8221;Among the Living Dead: 4.5 out of 5. Different kind of opening. Guitars playing off one another. High guitar squeals. Marching snare in the background. At 49 seconds the song finally kicks in. Stu then joins in and kind of picks up where he left off on the last song. The track is fast, then slows down to the beginning guitar styles at the start of the track&#8230;then picks up speed again. So there is this kind of back and forth happening&#8230;slow&#8230;fast&#8230;.slow&#8230;fast. And then something BEAUTIFUL just happens&#8230;at 2:30 Stu just punches you in the face with his AMAZING voice and as he takes a breather&#8230;Jon and the boys kick you down and keep you there until Stu comes back. At first listen this wasn&#8217;t my fave track&#8230;.until the 2:30 point and now it is one of my faves. Fast&#8230;strong&#8230;pounding&#8230;thundering&#8230;SOLID ICED EARTH!Resistance: 4 out of 5 stars. What??? You haven&#8217;t been beaten up enough yet??? You&#8217;re only 4 songs in and have 8 more to go! So RESISTANCE continues the thundering. Great guitars. Solid drum&#8230;and at 1:30 of this 5 minute song&#8230;Stu just lets you have it. At 2:27 it slows for a bit to give you time to catch your breath. You have about 30 seconds before the marching snare comes back to warn you that time is almost up. Great fist pumping and head banging song. Loved it!The End: 4.5 out of 5 stars. Beginning reminds me of the long middle part of Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Stu wants to enchant you a bit with his singing&#8230;but then he is ready to kick you in the arse at 56 seconds in. Jon, Troy, Raphael, and Luke come in swinging and pounding. Love this song. Good harmonies. Not as thundering as the previous tracks. It is a track to let you catch your breath and just enjoy the amazing musicianship of everyone in Iced Earth. At 2:48 you will get just that. It is a little Maiden-esque. But I like it. Actually, I LOVE it. Then things speed up quickly and the break you had a bit ago is DONE and at 4 minutes you are taken to a whole nother level! And to think&#8230;3 minutes to go still!!! Earlier parts and riffs are repeated until the 1 minute final slow down at 6 minutes that takes this track the first half of the album (the Something Wicked Saga portion) to a solid conclusion.If I Could See You: 3 out of 5 stars. This is a heavy ballad. Good song. Strong vocals. Nothing really stands out. Doesn&#8217;t mean it is a bad a track. It is NOT a filler track. Just a decent Iced Earth song.Cthullu: 5 out of 5 stars. Hope you had enough time to catch your breath and apply your band-aids cause you&#8217;re about to get kicked again! Song starts off slow, but you know something HUGE is waiting for you around the corner&#8230;and its name is Cthullu and is there anything bigger? NOT AT ALL! At 1:07 the song kicks in&#8230;Stu follows quickly behind and then Luke Appleton steps forward to show you his muscle and what he&#8217;s got!!! At 2:26&#8230;this song shines and becomes one of my faves on this album. If they don&#8217;t play this song live I will be PISSED OFF. One of their best songs ever. It is a 6 minute beast that rises out of the ocean to take no prisoners.Peacemaker: 4 out of 5 For the first minute or so it reminds me a lot of END OF INNOCENCE from Dystopia. Actually it sounds like the song could&#8217;ve been off of Dystopia.  But that all changes and become a guitar heavy with lots of chunking and powerful galloping. I like the song a lot. It&#8217;s is hard to have a follow-up to Cthullu because that song is SO GOOD. Stu&#8217;s voice shines here. Love it.Parasite: 4 out of 5 stars. I probably would&#8217;ve chosen this as the song to follow Cthullu. Big track! Great Iced Earth sound. Amazing tempo. It is only 3:30 long, but it is just as powerful as any of the earlier longer ones.Spirit of the Times: 3.5 stars out of 5.  I guess this is a track that could be found on one of the Sons of Liberty albums (Jon&#8217;s solo stuff). Kind of slow&#8230;ballady&#8230;I LOVE Stu&#8217;s voice when he just takes control of the chorus a minute in. It is a bit different than the previous tracks on the album. I am glad it is here. To me, the song is its best at the chorus.Highwayman: 3 out of 5 stars. This is a cover from the Highwaymen version with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. Iced Earth are joined by Michael Poulsen (Volbeat) and Russell Allen (Symphony X). It&#8217;s ok. Not bad. Just doesn&#8217;t wow me like the rest of the CD. To me it is Meh.Plagues of Babylon is a solid 4 star album. I give the deluxe version an extra half star for the inclusion of the DVD that goes behind the scenes of the making of Plagues of Babylon. So what does PLAGUES do for ICED EARTH? To me it solidifies Stu as their lead singer and if this continues there will be less and less comparisons of him to Barlow. He is making his mark and PLAGUES is one of the best IE CDs. If you like the Ripper Owens type of screaming you got on DYSTOPIA, you may be a bit disappointed because there isn&#8217;t a lot of it here&#8230;if at all really. Which I am glad. I remember when people feared what Maiden would do when Paul Di&#8217;anno left and who would fill his shoes&#8230;well&#8230;NUMBER OF THE BEAST silenced all of those critics. PLAGUES OF BABYLON will do just that. GET THIS CD and enjoy a solid heavy metal band who are at their peak with nothing standing in their way."
A38Y52KH1CG04Z,B00GH10BU0,4.0,I really like this album but cannot say it's better that Dystopia. By all means it's a must have but how do you beat a masterpiece like Dystopia ..very difficult. I would say we would of had to wait another year for that to happen. I am just so glad to have a new Iced Earth album that totally rocks in my hand for 2014 because I wore the heck out of the last cd! Iced Earth rules had have been underrated since day one! Support this band!
ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00GHJ3MGM,4.0,"In March 2012 I received (and reviewed) the \"Kings & Queens\" Cd from B&TK; and loved it.Guitarist/Songwriter/Record Producer Colin Linden is not a common name to US music lovers but, north of the border, in Canada he's pretty well known for some big hit songs. I was only made aware of his talents three years ago when he led the Guitar Summit at the International Folk Alliance Conference in Memphis and pulled in his \"friends\" who included James Burton, Ian Mclagan, Kathy Mattea, Freebo, Bill Kirchen and Jim Lauderdale (some friends!).For the Kings & Queens album project, Linden - along with pals - and fellow singer/songwriters Tom Wilson and Stephen Fearing - added great female singers to join them - one on each song. This time the guys are going it alone - at least vocally. They have two more members on bass and drums/percussion. And they all left their electric guitars at home for an all-acoustic album. With one exception, the 12 tracks here are all originals, composed by one of the guys (or in tandem with other writers). By alternating lead vocals the album has the feel of a laid-back homemade production. That's to the positive.The guys have been together for 18 years and this is their eight album (though just the second one I've heard.). I do like it but, honestly, not as much as the prior one. I miss some of those \"guests\" and, having seen Linden play live on the electric guitar (amazing), I guess I miss that too.The 45-minute CD comes packed in a tri-fold digipak with the inside showing song credits on one panel, \"thanks\" on another, production credits on the third and a full panel photo on the fourth.The band was originally based in Ontario, Canada (Linden moved to Nashville for session and producing work) and so their fan base may be bigger there. There is no question as to their talents, this didn't grab me enough for 5 stars.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\""
AKAZT5193KFR1,B00GI2Y3NY,5.0,And ended up with the blues.Shame on me! I forgot that Savoy Brown even existed. I've been listening to a lot of blue grass and was listening samples when I came across this album. I quickly forgot the grass and remembered the blues. This music gets your blood pumping.Savoy Brown's music is so good that I wore one of their earliest albums out long ago. I remember them now! Who knew the British could sing the blues so well?
ABTIOC8UQETAR,B00GJ7CSHG,2.0,"Sorry to be so one dimensional here, but this is just not what I want to hear from Paul Rodgers. If you want to hear Paul doing his version of Boz Scaggs or Van Morrison this is for you. I guess I'm just used to hearing such an iconic voice belting out blues based rock. This basic R&B..."
A3MTN9XW3KFHQY,B00GJ7CSHG,5.0,Heard a clip of this tape and had to have it before it was released well it came and it is my listening tape in the car lots of old songs with Paul Rodgers great voice love it!!!!
AH1XAIHVRTNW5,B00GJ7CVUU,4.0,I first wanna say that this album is GREAT! May not be their best to date but definitely hold its own. Sharons vocals are more emotional and fierce on this album and Robert Westerholt returns with his death metal back vocals on a song or two...The evolution of Within Temptation has been strongly shown on each album album that they have done. They definitely have alot of experimentation in this recording as well....And yes there is one song on the whole album that features the &#34;F-word&#34; but only the one so whoever wrote the review stating that there is blatant cursing on here needs to get it right..It's one song people... And A good one I must say and that song is &#34; And We Run&#34; (featuring Xhibit)...It doesn't hurt the integrity of this album at all...Its A great album and A hell of a comeback for WT. My point is this...Its worth every cent you pay for it. It delivers!!!!
A1V4MXF1SLG0U6,B00GJ7CVUU,4.0,"Sorry gang, but this will not be a favorite. First the quality is not great,, mine sounded very filtered down.The songs a good, but for me not great. ( I still LOVE YOU Sharon)"
AXJCEPVI2O2KX,B00GJ7CVUU,4.0,Within Temptation have always been the best of the female fronted metal bands. This would be another perfect album if they wouldn't have lowered their high standards and included a lowlife no talent rap moron. Keep the rap for those with a very low iq. Don't ever do it again.
A2S3CQ90I4DQVX,B00GJ7CVUU,5.0,"I have been listening to this band since Mother Earth and unlike most bands, Within Temptation has been steadily improving with each release.  I used to like about half of the music on each CD, then came The Heart of Everything and that record just floored me.  What a fantastic piece of work.  I was also very happy with The Unforgiving, and now I am very happy with Hydra as well.  I almost did not pre-order the CD because I have been burned in the past as bands decided to move in new directions.  Within Temptation has stayed true to their core talents and has delivered again.  Now if we could just get them to tour in the U.S. to support this album.  Normally I would pick out some standouts, but I really just like the whole package.  There is something for everybody.  Enjoy it."
A1F078712OPHQB,B00GJ7CVUU,5.0,"The best way to describe this new album is to take every soulful and hard-hitting piece of profound and powerful rock that you LOVE from Within Temptation and add a bit of Nitrous Oxide! This INCREDIBLE album takes the best things about WT and elevates it to new and heightened levels! The hard is harder and the sound if fuller, deeper, and seriously everyone on this album is COMPLETELY UNLEASHED! I have been a longtime WT fan, and am totally blown away with the daring and brilliant kick-ass sound of Hydra! Honestly, I cannot get enough of the non-stop awesomeness of each and every song on this one!!!Bonus: The second CD holds amazing covers of some modern favs! I liked the covers so much that I ran out to buy the Q-Sessions album. Check it out."
A24FRO6SZKL4SU,B00GJ7CVUU,2.0,"I love this band, but I just cannot enjoy this CD.  Too much &#34;collaboration&#34; with other singers...Sharon has such a beautiful voice, she doesn't need help!  WT has gone to a Top-40 sound...I could've started listening to an AM radio station instead spending money on this CD.  Okay, there's a couple songs that rock.  I can't remember the titles because I listened to Hydra the first day I received it, then haven't listened to to it again since.  There is a second CD that came with it that included special &#34;editions&#34; or &#34;remixes&#34; of songs from the first CD that was a complete waste of recording time.  I will continue to listen to WT's previous CDs, but I doubt I will give much play time to Hydra.  I still love the band...just can't stand this CD."
A2EO9YCJ519L5W,B00GJ7ROQG,5.0,One of the best Beatle albums ever (even with the three missing songs from the UK version). Plus you get both the mono and stereo versions on one CD.
A1DYB9MKFYEGS4,B00GJ7ROZW,5.0,"This is the CD which captures the music from the Beatles 'A Hard Days Night' motion picture. They have restored all the instrumental music on the original 1964 LP (record album) so that I can listen to the music as I heard it as a boy. If you are a Beatles collector, this CD is a must for a complete collection."
A2EV8A4U0VAKQ3,B00GJ7ROZW,5.0,Great Album in the original format i grew up with... about time!! The USA versions took a long time to come out but im glad they finally made it
ASW408J98RBCR,B00GJ7ROZW,5.0,"THIS ALBUM IS THE MOST WANTED FOR ANY BEATLES  MUSIC COLLECTOR.  KEEP THAT ORIGINAL FORCE OF SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINAL H.F. U.A. VINYL ALBUM. THE STEREO & MONO VERSIONS ARE SIMILAR IN CLARITY AND FIDELITY. IS THE BEST OF THE  NEW BOX COLLECTION SO FAR. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT DON'T HAVE A TRACK LIST FOR THE MONO & STEREO , THE ORIGINAL  BACK COVER ONLY HAVE THE ORIGINAL L.P. TRACKS LISTING , NO TRACK LIST  OF COMPLET CD  STEREO/MONO TRACKS CAN BE FOUND INSIDE AS A INNER NOTES , SO BAD."
AWTAT0SOG12BA,B00GJ7ROZW,1.0,"We all know the music is 5-star&#8230;&#8230;.it's the Beatles!!!  The aesthetics are the most salient issue worthy of note here..........why are these monumental works of art being packaged in cheap, mis-sized, cardboard sleeves? These sleeves do not fit in standard cd storage units&#8230;&#8230;and there&#8217;s an overwhelming  sense of &#8220;fast-food&#8221; disposability&#8230;&#8230;.very negative energy...Where&#8217;s the sturdy jewel cases with foldout inserts and pictures and stories and posters?&#8230;..this is the Beatles!!These releases look like they were a D.I.Y. kitchen table production by a penniless teenage quartet, sending out low-cost &#8221;demos&#8221; to get gigs!!Beatles&#8217; fans everywhere should be insulted and disappointed. This is like mounting a Rembrandt painting in a plastic Walmart  picture frame.If you keep a respectable music library.......do not buy these US Versions....you will be most dissatisfied."
A2EY3OVGI9CGAV,B00GJ7RP10,5.0,"Just listened to the mono tracks and a couple of the stereo tracks, and here is what I think.The mono tracks are identical to the ones released in 2009 in the mono box set.  Of course they sound superlative, and no other review is necessary. They are great.The stereo tracks that I have listened to so far are so much better than on the first Capitol box set, and more than rival those on the 2009 Beatles for Sale. Much fuller, without the annoying separation of sound in the two tracks (left and right), and Capitol did away with the annoying duophonic sound of the first set.  I must say that this album is sure to be listened by me much more so than the 2009 one.That said, the packaging, as in the older Capitol set, and the new 2009 ones, has a bit to be desired.  The fit is tight, more than my recollection of the box set 1, and much more than the 2009.  On the plus side, like the 2009 mono set, each slip case has an inner sleeve, but lacks the much better plastic one for keeping the CD in.  There is no information on the case about the tracks, but it is a reproduction of the original. A jewel case would have been much more preferred. I intend to keep my CDs in blank jewel cases and put away the new ones for safe keeping. Otherwise I am afraid that with repeated use the playing surface of the CDs can become scratched."
AWTAT0SOG12BA,B00GJ7RP2O,1.0,"This is the Beatles!  The world's greatest band!  And they release these landmark albums in cheap, mis-sized cardboard sleeves! Bare-naked except for a cd disc on the inside&#8230;&#8230;..I want sturdy jewel cases with foldout inserts and pictures and stories and posters&#8230;..this is the Beatles!! Make a big production out of it!! To add insult to injury, it's the  &#34;U.S. Version&#34; &#8230;&#8230;clearly noted&#8230;... that warrants  cheap, disposable, &#34;nothing special about it&#34; packaging&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.for the world's greatest band. A sad day for Beatles fans everywhere."
A31OKJRKHGLBYS,B00GJFBP8G,3.0,Could use a better selection of material
AUGWOPALTCQD8,B00GJSWWTY,5.0,"Really thought the first album was good. Tough call for which is better. This one is more consistent from start to finish, but the hooks are more subtle."
AQNPL942Z64BA,B00GKI40HU,5.0,"You get an excellent summary of the year's most popular songs, all in one spot. A must have for music enthusiasts."
A2MP4H9HI65BEO,B00GKI40HU,4.0,The CD encapsulates all the best songs for all genre and is presented with a flow thatstirs up all the emotions each song was meant to do.The artists were al deserving and these excrpts of their body of work is wrth owning.Count on playing it a few times for full enjoyment.
AE31M52VLKOG6,B00GKI40HU,4.0,"My favorite track is \"Same Love\" by Mackelmore and Ryan Lewis.  This is the first rap song that touches me.  This song is about having acceptance of every person regardless of their sexual orientation.  This is the strongest lyrical resonant  song on the disc. \"Brave\" by Sara Bareilles is another song that speaks to me lyrically.  This song makes me feel strong and to be afraid to say what I feel.  I am a big fan of Pink.  \"Just Give Me A Reason\" is a great pop duet.  I never thought I would like a song by Justin Timberlake.  I must confess that \"Mirrors\" is a song that has grown on me in the last year.  I like this song very much.I am not a big country fan, but I must confess that I like every country song on here. \"Merry Go Round\" features superb banjo playing.  This is the happiest song about dysfunctional lives I have ever heard.  Jason Aldean proves that country tunes can be simple subjects like taking a pretty girl out for a ride in a truck.  \"Take A Little Ride\" is a country song that really rocks. Taylor Swift proves that she is a talent as a solo artist with the pretty  song \"Begin Again\".  She also teams up on a touching duet entitled \"Highway Don't Care\". Blake Shelton has the kind of voice that touches me on the song \"Mine Would Be You\". I like this romantically sensitive country song.This disc also contains great dance jams like \"Locked Out Of Heaven\", \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Get Lucky\". I'm sure I would hear  these three tunes the next time I am in a club or at a party.  I could not get into the song \"Radioactive\" lyrically, but I think it has a good beat to it.  I couldn't get into the song \"Swimming Pools\".  This song just turned me off lyrically with the use of the N word.  \"Lego House\" is another song that did not appeal to me.  I think Ed Sheeran's voice does not have a tone in his voice that makes want to pay attention to him.  I just wanted to share my opinion about this disc.  I really enjoyed most of the songs on this Grammy compilation."
A26ZTFWPTLLKIQ,B00GKI40HU,4.0,All of the grammy collections are always good otherwise they wouldn't have been nominated for a grammy right?? It's alot easier buying a collection than buying separate CD's for all these artists.
A35S7W5BV5RTKY,B00GKI40HU,5.0,I've always liked these type of Grammy nominee and winner CDs.  I don't have an I phone/smart phone so I still like to buy CDs with hits from a variety of current artists.
A1IEUT6G90GXDF,B00GMBQMI0,4.0,"4 stars because it isn't perfect. How many albums are?Still it's a great album from an indie rock guy extraordinaire.It's light and fun and funny and extremely listenable.Will he shoot to the top of the charts? NoWill they gain any converts? It's doubtful but so what?If you've been clueless this long, nothing can save you.For fans it's a total no-brainer. One of his better solo efforts.Great follow-up to Mirror Traffic. Also an excellent record.Enjoy."
AHLBXE85XT34N,B00GNZLWQW,5.0,"Ryan Kelly has again proven himself and a songwriter, musician, and performer.  He has written about love, hate, relationships, and more importantly...LIFE!  From making you feel &#34;Significant&#34; and that it's &#34;Your Time&#34; to the fun &#34;Where I Belong&#34;  and &#34;Samba&#34; (Ryan at his sexy best)  to the uplifting &#34;Live for Life&#34;  this is a must for any Ryan Kelly fan or anyone that enjoys Celtic Thunder."
A33KUW6KKTF0O7,B00GNZLWQW,5.0,Ryan's 1st CD is good but this one is great. Ryan out did himself. Still love to him in Celtic Thunder. I just a huge fan and hopefully someday I'll get to see them in concert.Louise
A19D3R5YDCK2Z,B00GO55PAA,3.0,"I was kind of paranoid that the album would either be the greatest album to date. Or the worst album yet. I think it sits somewhere in between. Its not the classic TCM that I've grown to love. Every track has the same styled tone and sound to it and the drums almost seem digital. Unlike the rest, where every song has its own unique tone and sound. I was able to get over that pretty quick but their's a little bit of dubstep mixed in there that totally ruins the album for me. But then again, This could be the bridge that crosses the gap between bigbeat and dubstep genres."
A1BD73TAY4PQOW,B00GOI2ZTG,5.0,I find it remarkable to hear Jonas  sing schubert more personal than his operaarias.But wonderful all the same. Naturally.
A2N7699X91ZDCI,B00GOIKAIY,5.0,"hello all you Tommy Castro fans. I got this cd for my birthday from my wife,is it any reason I love her ? this cd is a MUST for his fans as well, IT KICKs A**! I listened to it in the house and I took a road trip of 600 miles and I love this cd.Tommy's got a lot of friend's helping him on this record so it has a different sound but it's all great. so buy it now !  or i'll come and get you !  Lar."
A1CW0R71X85WVI,B00GOIKAIY,5.0,I am a fan and love all his music.  Some of the locals here in South Dakota have become aware of him as well as it was great to see a poster in a local music store and was able to chat up about Mr Tommy.  Great exposure
A1731DX2REFIJO,B00GOIKAIY,5.0,"In This Cd you will find originals  and some covers that  are  on the edge of  genius, Tommy  Castro  will make you smile with udder joy of his talent.. Check this cd out if you are not satisfied then  don't rely on my  advice anymore  but I am sure you will agree this man has a talent  and will give you plenty of hours of enjoyment"
A3D462HK6U6IWL,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"This is her first solo cd and she really does an amazing job! The song diversity is great and has a little of everything.  The That Girl and This Angel, I feel, are the highlights of the cd."
A2CNQ1JV16GHW2,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"There are few albums you can't wait to listen to when you haven't even finished listening to them once, let alone afterwards.  (Some examples for me would be Norah Jones's first, John Mayer's \"Born and Raised,\" Sara Bareilles's \"Kaleidoscope Heart\" and Springsteen's \"The Rising.\")  Jennifer Nettle's \"That Girl\" is just such an album.  It's almost astoundingly good, not in any way your run-of-the-mill, \"this all sounds alike\" country album.  First of all, Ms. Nettles, a true class act, sounds better here than she has ever sounded before.  (Does anyone on the planet sing better than she?)  But what sets this album apart from almost every other album I've purchased lately is the care that has gone into its production (the album was recorded live and produced by legend Rick Rubin) and the material.  Nettles co-wrote most of the songs, and there isn't one that could even be remotely considered \"filler.\"  I have my favorites (the poignantly empowering \"Me Without You,\" the hilariously wrong \"Jealousy,\" the warm and lovely \"This One's for You,\" the powerful \"His Hands,\" and the title track, which plays like the flip side of \"Stay\"), but they are each and every one a winner.  In a recent Billboard article, Nettles is quoted as saying that she wanted the album to move people.  I think she's succeeded beyond her (or my) expectations."
AC65T09KN8K8T,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"I like Jennifer Nettles as part of Sugarland, but it's always interesting to see what an artist does on their own, and Jennifer does a nice job. Some of the songs are a little low key, and I like when she can belt out a rocking song with her awesome voice. Love her rendition of &#34;Like A Rock&#34;. You won't be disappointed with this girl's first time out."
A2OW7IPN31PIEX,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"I was disappointed when Jennifer Nettles decided to go out on her own, but you will NOT be sorry once you listen to this CD!"
A362IZXKZH585B,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"I love Jennifer Nettles. I'm sorry there is no my &#34;Sugarland&#34;, but I'm sure she'll be very successful on her new venture. I look forward to more."
A1W6OQQ9RZ5F6T,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,"She is a great chanteuse.  An almost unforgettable voice.  Lyrics are memorable.  I heard her on Letterman just once, and ordered the album.  Top recommendation."
AXC9IY03SZB47,B00GP7E3SC,5.0,She makes quite a debut in her solo album -  she is good but better with the guy by her side.  Still worth the time to listen.
AG9SCD6NFCN9F,B00GP7E472,5.0,"To those folks who only gave it only two stars: You have to listen to this new album four or five times, but then it really screws you up and gets you. You will appreciate it, and not get it out of your CD player again. This is the best album she ever made, and that incluces previous benchmarks such as &#34;Raw Like Sushi&#34; or &#34;Man&#34;.  This new album is almost electronic-experimental, somewhere between Kraftwerk and Pink Floyd, but more original, minimalist, soulful (Neneh's voice!)  and stripped down, and it needs to be, because it's stunning simplicity is the heart of it's pure genius and brilliance. All tracks stand out against today's other boring pole-dancing-strip-naked-teeny-weeny-mass-pop, and this is a slap in the face to all the Gagas, Madonnas, Beyonces or Cyrusses of this world - this is intelligent art rock, never  invasive, but always persuasive. &#34;Spit three times&#34; is the best song, &#34;422&#34; &#34;has the most etheral arrangenement featuring Rocket Number 9, and so does &#34;Everything&#34;, and all the other tracks more than serve the the broader vison of this album - the fact that Neneh's back gives me hope fo rth futre of pop/rock/hip-hop music.Cool and timeless!"
A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B00GP7E472,3.0,"I was there, and was cognizant enough, in early 1989, when &#34;Buffalo Stance&#34; became a smash hit, to remember how Cherry burst onto the scene and was different from her contemporaries. She seemed to blend electronic dance music with hip hop, which, in early 1989, had not really been explored yet. That summer, I got a job at a music store, Soundwarehouse, and I was able to listen to all of &#34;Raw Like Sushi&#34; many times there. I bought it. Flash forward to 1992 and Cherry's sophomore album, &#34;Homebrew&#34;. I bought it at the time and felt it was seriously overlooked by the public, and easily her finest work. Then, in 1996, she released her third album, &#34;Man&#34;, and as I recall, it was only released outside of the U.S., so I only came upon it as an expensive import, but I bought it. Not as good as her first two. Then she disappeared, literally, off the face of the earth. I wondered what had happened. Then the internet began to catch fire, and I was able to look her up and find out that she was doing many collaborative things with other musicians, but nothing I could obtain and listen to, and, well, nothing that sounded interesting enough to seek out.I know she did two albums with CirKus and one album with The Thing, but &#34;Blank Project&#34; is her first proper solo album since &#34;Man&#34;. I was wondering if &#34;Blank Project&#34; would sound like the old Neneh Cherry or if it would be more like CirKus or &#34;The Cherry Thing&#34;. I'd say it's a blend of all three, forging a new sound for Cherry. It's not exactly like any of her previous works, but also not radically different either. I am happy that she decided to do another solo album, and that she wisely kept it concise with ten songs. But, not all of the songs work, and I found myself a little disinterested with &#34;Across The Water&#34;, &#34;Cynical&#34; and &#34;422&#34; mainly. I think the best tracks are &#34;Blank Project&#34;, and particularly &#34;Naked&#34;, &#34;Weightless&#34;, &#34;Out Of The Black&#34; and &#34;Everything&#34;. I liked &#34;Spit Three Times&#34; and &#34;Dossier&#34; too, but to a lesser extent. &#34;Blank Project&#34; is an album that grew on me with repeated listening. It's not Cherry's best or worst work. I am hoping that she continues to make solo albums, and more frequently now.As always, my mind is constantly thinking of what someone like Cherry could do that would be interesting, and I think in the future if she did an entire album with Eagle Eye Cherry that would be interesting--like the way Neil and Tim Finn have collaborated over the years. I think Cherry could do some real interesting work with Skrillex, Avicii and Swedish House Mafia. Nicki Minaj, Rihanna or Kelis could also be interesting choices. Heck, what about Trent Reznor, The Roots, Gorillaz, Missy Elliot. Just a few thoughts for another album.As it stands, &#34;Blank Project&#34; is a welcome return, and maybe, over time, I will come to enjoy it as much, or more than her earlier work, but I can't help it, I really like her earlier work a bit more than what she has been doing lately. Here's how &#34;Blank Project&#34; compares with Cherry's other works:1989 Raw Like Sushi: Four Stars1992 Homebrew: Five Stars1996 Man: Three and a Half Stars2006 Laylow (with CirKus): [Don't have it, haven't heard it]2009 Medicine (with CirKus): Three Stars2012 The Cherry Thing (with The Thing): Three Stars2014 Blank Project: Three and a Half Stars"
A1KVYLQXRHLBZ7,B00GRHBEWI,5.0,"Whenever The Fray release a new CD, I know after listening to the songs a few times I'm going to love it.  This CD is no exception although, truth be told, I wasn't sure I would like it when I first heard it.  It sounded different than what I was expecting to hear from The Fray.  Hearing the band perform these songs live was amazing, and after watching a few live performance videos, especially the acoustic ones, I realized that even though this may not be exactly what we expect from The Fray, it's awesome!  Nothing stays the same, and just as we grow as people, I think bands grow and change with time.  This is still The Fray, and they are amazing musicians who are really talented and super nice guys.Several of the songs are really upbeat and the band attributes that to them being in good places and happy, at this point in their lives.  It shows.  &#34;Give it away&#34; almost sounds like something from the disco age.  It's really catchy!  The last two songs on the CD are a little bit slower (and not my favourites) but this is still overall a wonderful CD.  Just give a listen to &#34;Love Don't Die&#34; and &#34;Closer to Me&#34;... &#34;Wherever this Goes&#34; is another great song, and sounds incredible with simply Isaac and Joe on vocals and Dave on piano (no offense to their awesome drummer).  You can hear and see their love for the music when things are stripped down which just makes me appreciate this new CD that much more."
A2VL611VQPMIJE,B00GRHBEWI,5.0,I have enjoyed each of their CD's and this one is well done and very entertaining. Enjoy all of the songs !
A2AFKUNFXV6GL2,B00GRHVIGU,5.0,"Great music, but the digital quality needs improvement."
A3HLPNFR6FE4XF,B00GRHVIGU,3.0,"So, the good stuff first..Fantastically well recorded... David's voice still 'has it' big time !!Now the not so sexy..Production quality... boring.. just no oomph, sorry to say.. Really wanted to love it... the first track is very promising... then slowly & painfully downhill from there imho-Also lyrically.... eh.. not really exciting...Not sure if there could have been 'others' helping like &#34;If...&#34; from back in day..... but gosh... had lottsa potential...Let's call it a near miss..."
A3OZOONAA7HNTJ,B00GRHVIGU,4.0,"David Crosby has the voice of an angel.  Even as his voice ages, it lacks none of the soaring melody that is his trademark.  Don't pass this by.  As with his previous work, it will twine into a very special place and convey a body of work that represents all of the stars and scars of his own life."
A2NR82DR8CT7US,B00GRHVIGU,5.0,"Well Croz is at it again and if you know him then get this album.  He has a unique style that very few musicians will ever match and when gems lie this become available you should embrace them.  We all age, but David seems to be like fine wine that gets better with age.  Please get this album and you will not be disappointed."
A2W5ERW9GC6J5,B00GRHVIGU,5.0,"I've always liked Croz and this new release just reinforces why.  What can I say that's not already been said many times over.  The man is a legend.  When I listen to Croz I'm into lyrics first then the music.  This is a worldly songwriter and the music on this CD supports the messages.  This has to be one of his best yet and like a good wine he improves with age.  The musicianship here is superb.  I just love the unexpected and the clarinets and trumpets coming in when least expected add to the intrigue.  His voice is as good as ever.  This isn't CSN and it's really not CPR but it's overall feel is much closer to the latter, likely due to the influences of his son, James Raymond.  This is an impressive new release that I find myself listening to over and over.  Keep em coming David."
A28OGM5C71B1XD,B00GRHVIGU,1.0,"I'm a huge fam of early CSN&Y and I think some of Crosby's best and most interesting work can be found on Deja Vu.  Unfortunately, that was the high watermark for Crosby as he got involved in drugs and other issues.  Most of his solo work is pretty bad, but after reading the postitive reviews here I was hoping this might be good - it is not.  This is a real STINKER!  No  melodies at all...  AVOID!!"
A2O3PW57IFNUHV,B00GRHVIGU,5.0,"David Crosby occupies a paradoxical position in American music. He is simultaneously one of the most celebrated and one of the most underappreciated musicians of his gifted generation -- a generation that produced the timeless voices and visions of Bob Dylan, James Taylor, Neil Young, and many others. He is also one of the most quietly influential. By singing Dylan's early songs in the Byrds in crystalline harmony, Crosby gave the folksinger's career a significant boost. After hearing an unknown waif named Joni Mitchell sing in a club, he got her a recording contract that ensured her maximum creative freedom and produced her first record, launching her on her own intimitable career path. Crosby also turned the Beatles on to Ravi Shankar, and the world of pop music was never the same again. His music has been consistently fascinating, stretching the boundaries of pop, informed by jazz and world music as much as folk -- as Miles Davis knew when he recorded Crosby's sublime \"Guinnevere\" -- but as a result, his songs have never gotten the radio play of the tunes by his gifted bandmates in Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. [Disclosure: I've been listening to Crosby's music since I was a teenager in 1970, and have had the pleasure of knowing him since the early 1990s.]From the first bars of \"What's Broken,\" it's obvious that two-time Rock-and-Roll Hall of Famer Crosby is not resting on his Woodstock laurels for a second. This is one of the freshest, most innovative, and most vital albums of the year -- in no small part because Crosby forged an intimate musical collaboration with his brilliant son, James Raymond, whose keyboards and orchestral imagination turn these songs into cinematic landscapes that haunt your dreams. A poignant song about a drone bombing in the Middle East, \"Morning Falling,\" is like nothing Crosby's ever done, with its heart-wrenching photographic lyrics, Arabic-inflected melody, and aching woodwinds by Steve Tavaglione. \"Dangerous Night\" is equally devastating, built on a set of chords by Raymond that has the majesty of Bruce Hornsby's most memorable melodies and a set of lyrics that render a clear picture of the troubles of humankind in the 21st Century while delivering a stirring message of consolation. On every track, Crosby and Raymond -- with the help of illustrious guests like Mark Knopfler and Wynton Marsalis, and a brilliant rhythm section -- stretch themselves, creating an album of folk/pop/electronic grandeur that manages to sound completely new and yet also like a classic David Crosby recording. When Crosby and guitarist/vocalist Marcus Eaton lay down a spread of luminous harmonies a minute into \"What's Broken,\" you'll know you could be listening to no one else. There is darkness here -- check out the spare, desolate, sharply-drawn portrait of a young hooker in Amsterdam in \"If She Called,\" sung solo with electric guitar -- but there is also redemption in \"Radio\" and \"Find a Heart,\" two of the most upbeat and sparkling songs Crosby has ever recorded, tributes to the transformative power of love and compassion.Crosby set a very high standard for himself with his first solo album recorded in 1970, \"If I Could Only Remember My Name,\" but here he reaches that standard by coming at it from an unexpected angle, playing with the seasoned wisdom of age and the daring and ambition of youth, in the company of a band that deeply comprehends and extends his idiosyncratic vision. It's obviously a must-buy for his fans, but even for listeners who are only familiar with Crosby's moody contributions to CSNY, it's worth picking up as an exploration of new emotional and musical territory by one of the most fertile musical minds of our times."
A38VPM0MHHRW0W,B00GSD3CAS,3.0,"\"Unconditional\" is a great improvement from his previous albums. His covers are the best and I hope he continues to work with David Foster."
A36R7LGIW0BDM7,B00GSD3CAS,5.0,"I Always support Reuben and buy his CD's , however this CD automatically moves to the top of all his CD's. Love all 11 songs, probably Close the Door, being my favorite.  ALL 11 are great! As always Reuben's vocals are stellar, Love the ongs selections. GREAT Job Mr. Studdard!"
A17S39QJX0B6ZN,B00GSD3CAS,4.0,"This is the album I've been waiting for from Ruben!!  There's not one bad track on this album.  His vocals are smooth.  He's a bona fide crooner.  I'm glad he hooked up with David Foster, cause Foster gave Ruben something he could work with.  My favorite tracks on the album so far is the old Boz Scaggs cut, Look What You've Done To Me (I was always crazy about the song) and Bonnie Raitt's classic, I Can't Make You Love Me!Congratulation Ruben!!  Keep 'em comin'!!"
A2ETZ7GF5B1712,B00GSIRMGS,3.0,"With the success of Kendrick Lamar's debut album, it pretty much brought more life to the west coast with many releases from new artists. I remember hearing Kid Ink back in 2011 with his mixtape Wheels Up. Although it was not impressive to me, I felt that he can make songs that will get major airplay. Few years and few mixtapes later (ie Rocketship Shawty), we have his debut album on Sony to start of the 2014 year.As you can tell Kid Ink style is aimed at the younger crowd. As I would expect from the album, the songs here can rock a party/club scene. The impressive thing is that since 2011, Kid has developed a better flow, and with the beats provided here, he can ride them real well. Unfortunately when it comes to substance, Kid has none. On this album, Kid isn't saying anything that no one hasn't said before, even on this side of the decade. The topics he covers is the same old things: money, women, ballin out at the club, etc. Only difference is that it is coming from a guy with an enhanced voice from the west coast. Obviouslly I knew that before I was going to hear this album, so there is no dissapointment there.If you can get past the lack of topics that Kid has on here, you will find some pretty decent songs on here. \"Hello World\" is a pretty strong intro for the album. Despite it being a strong song, if you hear that as the first track, expect for the album to be the same way. Kid seems to be at his best when paired up with Chris Brown, who appears on two songs \"Show Me\", and \"Main Chick\". Both songs have production provided by DJ Mustard, so they will make you move. I prefer the latter song than the former. \"No Option\" with Los is another standout song, and shows how good Kid's flow really is. \"I Don't Care\" featuring Maejor Ali is a pretty good song.The bad things are on this album are many. MGK outshines Kid on \"No Miracles\". \"Murda\" featuring Pusha T is terrible (I'm sorry but Pusha T's verse was terrible). As for solo songs, don't expect anything from Kid. Aside from \"Hello World\", all songs are about the same thing.If you decide to get the bonus tracks from here, the only one I recommend is \"Bad A**\" featung Meek Mill and Wale, but even though thats not that good of a song.Overall Kid Ink's \"My Own Lane\" is average. Obviouslly if you're into beats and lyrics aren't your thing, then you will enjoy this album. This is one of those albums you can play in your car on a night out. If Kid Ink wants to remain in the game, he needs to come up with something different, than just rhyming about what everyone else is. That will put him in his \"own lane\". Peace.Lyrics: CProduction: BGuest Appearances: B-Musical Vibes: C+Top 5 Songs:1. No Option (featuring Los)2. Hello World3. Main Chick (featung Chris Brown)4. I Don't Care (featuring Maejor Ali)5.

A1HWMU2XORHEI4,B00GTO6YE2,5.0,"It was July of 2004 and my best friend and I headed to Chicago to the Curiosa Festival. We were psyched, man. The Cure, Interpol, The Rapture, and a bunch of other bands. Who cares who else was there? The Cure and Interpol, that's all we needed to know. So we arrived in the early afternoon, headed to the beer garden and bought ourselves a guitar-shaped liter of some watered-down lite beer. We made our way to the stadium seats under the pavilion of the amphitheater and noticed immediately that the noise emanating from the stage had taken a sharp turn to the grating. No longer could we hear ourselves speak or think. There were four or five guys on stage creating this wall of noise. This shrieking flaming phoenix of noise began rising from the stage, filling every square inch of seat, concrete, dirt, and fence within the Tweeter Center. Pretty soon people were running from their spots directly in front of the stage clasping their hands over their naked ears. Blood began flowing from their earholes as if this sonic assault from a relatively underwhelming stage was liquifying their brains. I found it hard to breathe as if the squall from the Marshall amps and motionless guitars were thickening the air. It was a wave of dense, bright, razor wire-sharp noise that I'd never heard the likes of before. I turned to my best friend to see if we should exit the place before it imploded but it was too late. He'd succumbed to the nuclear blast of Marshalls and Gibsons and was lying on the beer-stained floor of the seemingly harmless amphitheater; his guitar-shaped liter of warm lite beer snapped in half from the seizure he'd endured. He was foaming at the mouth, what looked to be grey matter seeping from his earholes and a mixture of Miller Lite and urine staining the front of his cargo shorts. I knew I was going to have to carry him out in order to save what little bit of sanity and brains he had left. I began pulling him by his Curiosa Festival Tour shirt up the aisle to possible safety. All he could do was stare up at me, eyes half crossed, guyliner running down his cheeks, saying something that sounded like \"Moebye...moebye...moebye.\" I think he'd had a stroke by the droop in his left eye and left side of his mouth. Before I could get us to row B in the upper section of the amphitheater the aural assault suddenly stopped. Silence reigned in the former World Music Theater, the only noise was the ringing in our collective ears. Pretty soon someone came to the stage and said \"Give it up for Scotland's Mogwai!\" I looked down at my urine-soaked best friend, he smiled at me with a tooth missing(how'd he lose a tooth?) and said \"Mogwai...Mogwai...Mogwai.\"And so began my introduction to Mogwai.Rave Tapes is the newest album from Mogwai, the Scottish five-piece that are known for their extreme volumes, intense guitar workouts, and post-rock soundscapes. It seems that a good portion of their original fans have been disappointed with their last few years of musical output. \"It's not like Rock Action.\" \"Why can't they go back to Come On Die Young?\" Well, to them I say grow up. If you don't like the new stuff, then listen to the old stuff and let Mogwai grow. Let them spread their post-rock wings and find new sounds, new trips, new sonic explorations. Ever since 2008s The Hawk Is Howling Mogwai have been refining their sound. They've been expanding the musical palette, if you will. Even before that. Even back with Rock Action and Come On Die Young the band wasn't always about the guitar bombast and intense noise assaults. They've always toyed with analog synths, wavering square waves, and 80s soundtrack vibes. With 2011s Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will and then last year's Les Revenants( a soundtrack to the French TV series of the same name) they took the moody, dire sound they'd toyed with all along even further. Now with Rave Tapes I feel they've gone \"all in\", as it were. They've embraced those warm analog synths, moody gothic moods, and 80s soundtrack vibe and have created one of their warmest and complete records to date. Sure, I may be in the minority with this opinion and that's okay. I'm more comfortable that way.\"Heard About You Last Night\" opens the album and pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the record. It's really quite a lovely song, carried by a simple synth part, bass, clean guitar, and quiet drums. These guys should continue down the path of film scoring and Danny Boyle should call them immediately. \"Simon Ferocious\" is up next and keeps the sunshine firmly planted on the proceedings. Warm, bubbly synths percolate along as the rhythm section of Dominic Aitchison and Martin Bulloch create a steady rumble which the rest of the band can move freely and create moody sonic movements. \"Remurdered\" gets darker quickly, with a sound reminiscent of both John Carpenter's Christine soundtrack and Cliff Martinez' work with Nicolas Winding Refn. You can almost see those neon lights flickering and reflecting off of a car hood as it drives down Wilshire Boulevard. \"Hexon Bogon\" brings back some of the louder moments of \"The Hawk Is Howling\", while \"Repelish\" adds a spoken-word piece about Devil worship and Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway To Heaven\" as the band plays eerie, rolling music behind it. \"Deesh\" is a gothic-sounding, beautiful track that brings side two up a notch or two, while \"No Medicine For Regret\" is very reminiscent of some of those classic 70s Italian horror movie soundtracks by Walter Rizzati. \"The Lord Is Out Of Control\" ends this pretty amazing album like a cross between Vangelis, Giorgio Moroder, and the band's own masterpiece \"Scotland's Shame\".I've said my peace. I think Rave Tapes is a shining spot on Mogwai's already stellar musical discography. You'd be doing yourself a disservice writing this one off. Give it another spin. Or five.Editor's Note: The above-mentioned story regarding the Curiosa Festival actually happened, with some creative license taken by the author for entertainment purposes only. No Mogwai fans were harmed in the making up of that story, nor were any guitar-shaped liters of flat, warm beer."
A38U3JIQWUON8P,B00GULA0TY,3.0,"Been a fan since he was a sideman on Joshua Redman's Mood Swing, having bought every leader/co-leader release of his since. This one I like least. Consider that a feint damn. I love when jazz-piano greats take on the Rhodes and synths (Chick Corea, for instance). Mehldau does so as expertly and exploratively as one would expect. My main issue are the vocal parts, mostly narrations and lyrical figures. I find them jarring, eye-ball rolling and pretentious (much like BM's verbose liner notes over the decades). The pieces that serve as a vehicle for vocal ramblings are the ones I remove from my Mehliana mix. BM's my favorite pianist these days. (Dave Holland and he are tied for my favorite groups.)He is certainly entitled to explore his lyrical side. Anyhow, fans of his will certainly enjoy his keyboard explorations. Wish he'd do another project with this instrumentation but minus voices. Must-listen track: Swimming."
A1J2LQPDI4NKRG,B00GULA0TY,3.0,"I&#8217;ve long been a fan of Brad Mehldau, and I have no problem with him branching off from the standard piano trio. While there are some good tracks on this album, there are as many throw-aways. The first track is very self-absorbed, with Brad reading a text about a dream he had; the same text that&#8217;s in the liner notes. Several tracks have voices speaking over them, which detract from the music. While there are some good sounds on this album, it really comes across as a hodgepodge of different types of music, with no firm direction.I like Hungry Ghost, Swimming and a couple of others. But the title track is a waste, Gainsbourg is annoying, and some of the others are just mediocre. This isn't like Miles Davis discovering electricity; what Mehldau and Guiliana are doing is nothing groundbreaking. They have a lot of potential, and this album shows that they could go far, but they need to be more discerning with what they release.Oh, and &#34;Mehliana?&#34; Couldn't they have come up with something better than that?"
AKJFH1G2FP27I,B00GUP9P0K,5.0,"This album is a surprise to see reissued on CD. There's a lot of history with this Mamas and Papas anthology album, first released in early 1970. The CD sounds as clear as my vinyl ever did. The original album booklet with photos, liner notes and lyrics are all included, but obviously in reduced size. The concept of this album was different than other Mamas and Papas greatest hits albums. Interviews with John Phillips and Cass Elliot were done for this release, and they come before the songs. Not every song has an interview piece, but for the tracks that do, the interviews do overlap with the beginnings of the songs. While the instrumental intros to CALIFORNIA DREAMIN', CREEQUE ALLEY , I CALL YOUR NAME, and STRAIGHT SHOOTER and a few others begin, John is talking before the vocals come in. For this reason, some people may not want this version of the group's greatest hits. All the original versions of the songs are here. One of the album's greatest strengths is the inclusion of some rehearsals and chatter in the recording studio. ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT adds another minute of a group vocal in the studio before the released album version is played. I CAN'T WAIT and DANCING BEAR offer a little bit less in extra studio time. Cass' quotes are illuminating as well, with how the group got their name and how she still appreciated the songs that John wrote for the group.All the 20 songs on this set are from the group's first 3 albums. The 4th album, THE PAPAS AND THE MAMAS , from 1968 is not represented at all. If you want to own hits like TWELVE-THIRTY and DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME , they are not included on this set. Other hits like LOOK THROUGH MY WINDOW and GLAD TO BE UNHAPPY weren't included as well. There are quintessential album favorites such as NO SALT ON HER TAIL, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, FREE ADVICE and GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO. This release is more of a connoisseur set for the fans. For listeners who want a greatest hits collection of the group with every hit , and no interviews at the start of songs, GREATEST HITS,  or 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS would be more complete for charted hits.There aren't any extras added in this CD release. There was a promo 45 that ABC/Dunhill issued that contained some extra snippets of interviews , but these are not added on at all. It would have been a big plus had these been added. The release of the added rehearsal & session work on this 1970 release begs the question though of where are the original session tapes. It is said that ABC/Dunhill threw out the original session master tapes of The Mamas & The Papas sometime in the early to mid-70's. That is why in all these decades since that there aren't any really substantial amount of unreleased or alternate takes of songs . While other record companies mine their catalogs for lavish reissues and box sets of their classic artists, ABC/Dunhill's discarding of the original session tapes is something that can never be corrected.With vinyl back in style, a collector would be wise to buy the original vinyl box set. With the tracks with interviews that are blended together, plus the beautiful photo filled booklet in a large format to look at, it is a much better experience to have and hold. The album was subsequently reissued as a gatefold, without the booklet. The original pressing in the box is the one to get."
A3HNQ7DH4A3YK0,B00GUXO12O,5.0,"In listening to this record, I became once again excited about Bruce, I was not as excited as when I stood in line for &#34;The River&#34; album but as excited as when I would see the Born in the USA tour. This record has captured much of the sound I recognize to be Bruce Springsteen. The energy is in each song as it was not in so many albums previous. I might be one of the biggest Springsteen fans I know and this album has once again made me proud to be the advocate for &#34;The Boss&#34; and his later body of work. &#34;High Hopes is a song that immediately moves you to feel the anthem in its percussive attack. The songs seem to be more cohesive to the overall tone of the record than even &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34; which I did enjoy and was happy enough to go see him in, New Orleans based of the songs, but for those who go this year, hold on to your friends because it's going to blow you away. I believe that if he brings Tom Morello, it would amp up the power to at least 11."
A31KXTOQNTWUVM,B00GUXO12O,1.0,"Oh boy...this must be pornography to any good liberal: the (a'huh-huh-huh) \"guitar player\" of the Karl Marx-approved \"Rage Against,\" blah-blah-blah on a new Stringbean CD.  Gee.  I'm already starting to feel guilt about...whatever....1/21 - Amazon sweetly deleted my rebuttal to all the bed-wetters who'd expressed their (in most cases, illegible) opinion.  But it seems that I am not the only one to see that \"High Hopes\" (if only!) is but a tepid rehash of his earlier...\"stuff\" or the (a'huh-huh-huh AGAIN) \"contributions\" of that \"great american,\" Morello."
A23ZOHTHNK88YY,B00GUXO12O,5.0,"Nebraska is still my favorite release, but his last few releases have been off the charts. Played this one through for the first several times last night and it is awesome. I will let others break it down song by song, lyric by lyric, I don't have the chops for that, I just loved it and I am glad I am alive during Bruce's time!!!"
AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00GUXO12O,4.0,"I'd say HIGH HOPES is for two groups of people: Springsteen completists, who have to have everything he does; or people like me, who aren't completists and as such DON'T already have everything else he's done (including other versions of some of these tunes).  Not all of these songs have appeared before; but they were all intended for earlier released, or are covers.Let's also get another thing straight: this is more of a Springsteen/Tom Morello album.  Morello's stamp is all over HIGH HOPES.  That's both good and bad; he adds a nice sonic touch here and there...but we get ANOTHER version of &#34;Tom Joad,&#34; when we didn't really need one.  Same goes for &#34;Dream Baby Dream,&#34; and &#34;41 Shots&#34; (which admittedly is more solid than the previous live version, though it lacks some of LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY's spontaneity).  The title track, one of the covers, rocks along and is an album highlight.  So is the whimsical &#34;Frankie Fell in Love&#34; and the haunting &#34;The Wall.&#34;  Other tracks feel like...well, like lesser cuts from TRACKS: not essential, worth a listen or two, probably awesome to hear live.There's no denying that the Boss has still got it.  At moments on HIGH HOPES, we catch glimpses of the fire-fueled rockstar from yesteryear, albeit tamed by wisdom and maturity.  There's a lot to enjoy here; there's not quite as much to love.  It's more of a &#34;collection&#34; than a cohesive album (though all songs were rerecorded specifically for this record), a bit of a grab-bag from cuts didn't fit elsewhere.  If you don't get your hopes too high (groan), you'll enjoy this offering.  If you're just starting your excursion into the world of Bruce Springsteen (about time!), then start where everyone else does: the beginning."
A3EYPIHP84RX6H,B00GUXO12O,3.0,"My opinion of this disc may improve after I have lived with it a while as it stands after the first listen, I would put it as a mid level Springsteen record. This is a heavily produced record much like the Rising and Magic and I guess I just like my Springsteen more raw. I think this is the 4th or 5th album he has used Brendan O brien and to be honest just not a fan of his production. I love that after 16 or 17 studio albums and being in the business for over 40 years Bruce is willing to stretch out and not make the same record over and over but I just don't know what to make of this record. Definitely a more thoughtful record than working on a dream which probably should never have seen the light of day but doesn't have the immediacy and passion that Wrecking Ball had.Some really good tracks here, Hunter  of invisible game and the Wall. Bottom line I guess I just don't see this as a record you will play over and over or think of as a classic like Darkness or the River and even in the context of his more contemporary records. On the positive side I have to say I love how Amazon put this on autorip right away so I could enjoy it while my disc is being delivered."
AV7CO2J7XO9VR,B00GUXO12O,5.0,"First of all, I love Bruce Springsteen. He puts it all on the line, doesn't hold back. On &#34;High Hopes&#34; this is evident. Listen to the song, &#34;High Hopes&#34; and then &#34;The Ghost of Tom Joad.&#34; Two songs that go beyond good, they are great."
A24IBBUZIHTPRQ,B00GUXO12O,4.0,"While I would have given the disc 4-stars myself (5 stars in my mind represents a new classic) I do agree that this is a very, very good album that I delayed purchasing for far too long due to the early reviews here on amazon.There have been a lot of comments about the \"fragmented\" nature of the album, but it sounds nearly as cohesive as Wrecking Ball to me, and is unified by the production which is typical post-Rising pop-compression. Unfortunate that.I think it's no coincidence that the deluxe version is packaged with a live Born In The USA DVD - aside from offering an obviously hook for older fans, BITU was also heavily criticized by Born To Run/Darkness fans as being too light, too pop-y, too much of an attempt to sell-out and reach-out. Yea. We all know what happened - Bruce hit it out of the park, and it became an iconic album. (Even to the far right, for the wrong reasons)High Hopes is a strong, cohesive, and eminently enjoyable disc. (The DVD is just icing on the cake - have yourselves a good time). Not one song here hits the depths of Queen of the Supermarket, and quite a few hit the Wrecking Ball water mark. As others have noted, the revisited Tom Joad and 41 Shots are revelatory.I encourage everyone to heed the lead reviewer's words - this is a very, very good disc indeed. I no longer expect another Darkness, or what was for me another Springsteen peak, Tunnel Of Love. I simply continue to be surprised and amazed by the prodigious talent of this guy from Jersey who seems to have maintained his moral center, his sense of self, and his sanity in the face multiple life/band crises.Not to mention his talent, and infectious love of performing.Godspeed Bruce Springsteen. That Kennedy Center medal remains well deserved."
A37LBFBAQPTYQC,B00GUXO12O,5.0,The lyrics are original and I enjoyed what I heard very much.  The quality of the CD is excellent thank you.

AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B00GUXO12O,4.0,"This January 2014 release from Bruce Springsteen is the 18th album from The Boss.It's a very good, but not great, Springsteen album. If a five star rating was applied to Springsteen's classic albums from the 1970s and 1980s (and those albums are all very worthy of 5 star ratings) then this one gets a four star rating by comparison.This one is twelve songs (mostly new material, with some new versions of older material)  with a total playing time of just over 56 minutes. If you like Bruce Springsteen, this one is worth adding to your collection."
A3MKF53SRNUQWS,B00GUXO12O,4.0,"Big Springsteen fan.  Love the lyric, the turn of phrase and the sense of raw emotion he brings to these timeless classics he creates.  Every album has its highs and less than highs and this one is no different.  To those of you obsessing about his political views - get some perspective.  You connected (presumably) to his message before and it hasn't changed.  Its music - it cuts through the politics.  Better than Working On a Dream (his weakest IMHO).  My faves:  Harrys' Place (prefer not the F bomb but we live in a real world), 41 Shots (equal to the live version), Just Like Fire Would (great song which deserves this exposure), The Ghost of Tom Joad Dream Baby Dream.  Going to the show in February 2014 and can't wait....."
A7W54Y0DGSKWB,B00GUXO12O,5.0,"As was pretty skeptical when I saw the song listings before this one came out. It was a head scratcher for me, despite my devotion to Bruce and his music. I should have known better. This is a great set of music, and the two tunes that I didn't think I needed to hear studio versions of, turn out to be stunners. 41 Shots and The Ghost Of Tom Joad, are both done so well, you'd be robbing yourself of a great experience if you didn't give them a listen. The CD is a delight."
A3Q64FUDPULTVH,B00GUXO12O,5.0,These songs follow a theme and I am happy to have this CD which showcases songs that were written in the past but did not make the final cut into a past record.
A30IXOR3S5UN6F,B00GUXO12O,5.0,How could you not love this Bruce music!
A2K6H0GJA067E4,B00GUXO12O,4.0,"It seems to be that Bruce did it again, putting out another great record with High Hopes.  First off I will say that this album was not as good as Wrecking Ball, but don't discount that, this was a solid album from top to bottom , and the addition to Tom Morello to the album was fantastic.  The opening track High Hopes, which was a single, really does boost your hopes, as it is as rocking as any of his other upbeat tracks.  There are some new tracks on the album that I really enjoyed, those being:&#34;Frankie Fell in Love&#34;&#34;This is your Sword&#34;&#34;Hunter of Invisible Game&#34;&#34;Heaven's Wall&#34;I also really enjoyed the remake of &#34;The Ghost of Tom Joad&#34; as Morello just absolutely shreds his guitar to pieces, in the almost 8 minute long marathon song.  The addition of the cover of &#34;Just like Fire Would&#34; is a really cool song too, as it seems to fit and feel just like an original Bruce song.The DVD that came with the pack was great too, as &#34;Born in the USA&#34; is a great, world class album, and the entire DVD is BS&ESB; performing the album in its entirety.  This album is solid, and will probably not disappoint."
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H,B00GUXO12O,1.0,"Stringbean has always been an overrated Bob Dylan wanna be clown,who sounds like he's trying to squeaze out a huge dump into the toilet.How this meathead ever made it into music biz,is just way beyond me,the stars,the planets and the entire solar system."
A18AIBGZI8WMA7,B00GVFJ54A,5.0,"I saw the movie on Christmas day and then ran out and grabbed the soundtrack the next day.  The movie was incredible and the soundtrack is as well.  Duke Ellington's Jeep's Blues gets me into a genre I normally don't enjoy.  Goodbye yellow Brick Road is a great song.  I wish they had used the original White Rabbit, but this one is decent.  Live And Let Die is perfect for the film, How Can You Mend A Broken Heart actually gets me to like the Bee Gees.  Long Black Road by ELO is outstanding and was the main reason for wanting the soundtrack.  Overall this soundtrack is outstanding and I am glad that it's in my collection.themusiccollecter"
A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00GVFJ54A,5.0,"The soundtrack to David O. Russell's &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; was such a knockout with Alabama Shakes' &#34;Always Alright&#34; rising to my favorite song of the year in my own personal top ten.  I figured with such a great ear for music and the ability to use it in a film, I should try listening Russell's latest hit &#34;American Hustle.&#34;  Duke Ellington's &#34;Jeep's Blues&#34; immediately caught my ear with its bluesy jazz and has become a mainstay in my short-list song rotation here in 2014.  Cut in 1956, Ellington's smoky sax track brings to mind a sexy swanky era in music that glues my ears to the speakers.  Mayssa Karaa's Arabic lyric to the Jefferson Airplane's rock-smoker hit &#34;White Rabbit&#34; is off-center enough that it makes the most of the great familiar song with a twist of the Middle East.  &#34;10538 Overture&#34; by Electric Light Orchestra churns delightfully with a 70s flair.  &#34;Long Black Road&#34; rests on a rhythmic riff and punches its way with some slamming electric lead guitar.  ELO's Jeff Lynne's &#34;Stream of Stars&#34; apparently written for the film sounds like homage to surfer music by Dick Dale.  The CD concludes with Danny Elfman's pixie-like instrumental gem &#34;Irving's Montage.&#34;  This soundtrack is immensely listenable with gems like Elton John's &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&#34; Donna Summer's &#34;Love to Love You Baby&#34; and Wing's great James Bond hit &#34;Live & Let Die.&#34;  Enjoy!"
APQJWNYVZFC5J,B00GWMRSAU,4.0,"This is the first issue in the Czech Philharmonic's Decca cycle of the complete Dvorak Symphonies and Concertos conducted by Jiri Belohlavek. It seems a bit surprising that for the three concertos non-Czech soloists have been chosen. While Alisa Weilerstein is clearly a good cellist, she doesn't yet have the strongest feeling for the Dvorak idiom so, full of warmth though it is, this performance cannot compete with those on famous earlier recordings such as that by Pierre Fournier with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by George Szell from the 1960s, or later readings by Rafael Wallfisch with Charles Mackerras conducting.Decca doesn't have an especially strong record with this concerto, though their 1950s recording, also with Fournier but with Rafael Kubelik conducting the Vienna orchestra, sounds quite good now in its CD version on Eloquence (mono) - the balance between orchestra and soloist is in some ways better than on this new, and generally much more richly recorded, version.  May be a re-mix would help - as it is, in the many passages where cello and woodwind should converse, the cello predominates - an especial pity as there are some wonderful solo players - how much better the end of the slow movement could have sounded with better balance in the recording. The strings too - which can be wonderful with this orchestra - don't sing out as they should when taking over a melody that the cello has sung.  Decca's other version, with Ashkenazy conducting, has a rather dull soloist, so they must b hoping for a modern success with this new version.So far as Alisa Weilerstein herself is concerned, she shows both lyrical beauty and fire in the quicker passages, but has difficulty in achieving the integration needed - maybe partly Dvorak's fault, but the greatest soloists have overcome this.  Her playing is without the distracting mannerisms of several other soloists in recorded versions.It is rather odd that the orchestral versions of the Rondo and Silent woods were not recorded here, though these versions with piano are also authentic Dvorak. All the shorter pieces are played with full tone, rather self-consciously so in some cases, and again the balance is too much in the cello's favour, though when the piano is playing alone it seems to jump forward and come over strongly. The Rondo is mostly a lively and successful performance, but the arrangement of Goin' Home doesn't come over at all - not  the players' fault. Jiri Barta on Supraphon has an interesting collection of Dvorak Cello and Piano pieces including both of these though not the arrangements by others Alisa Weilerstein gives, and this also included a complete original version of Dvorak's earlier concerto, with the piano as Dvorak wrote it.Jiri Belohlavek has been the conductor for several earlier recordings of the concerto on CD and perhaps they are all a little disappointing so far as the soloist is concerned - the recording with Jiri Barta has a Czech soloist and is well worth hearing - though the comments about lack of integration above would apply to this performance too. Best of all of them is perhaps the version with Steven Isserlis, which can be seen and heard online but so far as I know has not yet been issued as a CD or DVD, though licensed to BVA International - Steven Isserlis's recent CD version with a tepid orchestra cannot compete with it. For those who specially want a female soloist in this work, the interesting and effective 1960s Deutsche Grammophon recording by Anja Thauer, also with the Czech Philharmonic but better balanced than the new Decca, has been reissued on CD by both Tower Japan and Hastedt.The cover of the booklet shows Alisa Weilerstein in the woods near Dvorak's house at Vysoka - in the picture on the reverse she appears to be praying to achieve a Rusalka in reverse, just like Vaclav Hudecek standing in the same spot in the cover of his RCA LP version of the Brahms concerto.  With due respect to the soloist, couldn't Decca have shown at least one picture of just the woods themselves! My copy of the CD itself is in an attractive lime green solid colour - I haven't come across this with Decca before.Belohlavek is certainly a master conductor of Dvorak and the orchestra seems to be in fine form nowadays, so future instalments in this series, especially of the symphonies, can be looked forward to."

A1KJAOH72SVUZY,B00GY6ZACC,5.0,"Noah Gundersen has put out some very good EP's in the past, most notably, Family which was his most polished work to that point.  With Ledges, he has truly delivered an impressive album from start to finish.  He has of the best voices in the Folk genre but what sets him apart is his ability to write lyrics and songs.  This ability truly shines on tracks like Ledges, Boathouse, First Defeat and Poison Vine.  Overall, this is a great album that deserves a lot of acclaim."
A2B6OX6FFLOLL0,B00GYAP848,3.0,"Let the buyer beware that the original versions of these songs are far better and worth un-covering. So, if Brooks' intent was to expose new fans to great classics, then I'm behind him 100 percent if it points new music fans to the original artist versions.Garth Brooks doesn't so much try to re-invent the songs he grew up with and loves, as he does to try and re-create them, right down to trying a Bob Seger growl on &#34;Against the Wind,&#34; or a Stewart rasp on &#34;Maggie May.&#34; He also employs session musicians who do a great job of mimicking the original licks, but again, let's be clear, these re-creations don't have the inspired soul or gritty distinction of the originals. It's sometimes the imperfection of the band work on the originals that made them stand out.Still, you can't argue with the value, which, for The Ultimate Hits alone, is worth the price since those ARE Garth Brooks originals and also what he does best. He's got a good voice, but the way he tries to bend it to sound like the original artists on all the other covers ultimately disappoints.Bottom line: I would have preferred sloppy covers with extended licks as if he were playing them in a cheap roadhouse or bar somewhere and trying to make them his own."
A3KIUYDO0A9EY6,B00GYAP848,5.0,"First off the $35.00 this guy is asking for is crazy, on sale at Wal-Mart for $24.99. I bought two of them one to listen to and one to hold on to. Brief background, I have been listening to country music since Basic Training at Ft. Jackson in 2006, first song I heard was &#34;The World&#34; by Brad Paisley.Now while I knew who Garth Brooks was, and I of course knew &#34;Friends in Low Places&#34; it wasnt until a friend sent me hist &#34;Garth Brooks Live&#34; album that he became one of my favorite Top 5 Artists period. When I saw this Box Set included the Wynn Live Show that was enough for me to spend the $25.00. So far I have skimmed through the included CDs, but I have really just been listening to the Ultimate Hits, which is nice to have versus rotating the CDs from my other 2 Garth Brooks Boxed Sets, this has all of the favorites.He is a talented artist his vocals and take of some of the songs that have influenced him from childhood to adulthood are great. They really let you know how Garth came to be. I cannot wait for the 2014 World Tour, I was too young the last time he was on Tour to go but I wont miss out this time."
A3F0XXV23ONHOZ,B00GYAP848,4.0,"Clean production on this bonanza of covers, plus a 2-CD best of, for $25 from Walmart. Pay more here.The albums consistently sound like Garth Brooks doing covers, with excellent backing. If you don't want to hear Garth on karaoke steroids, this is not for you.It is clear that Garth puts considerable care into his work, as he always has. Nice touches throughout, where Garth subtly makes his own mark, even as he respectfully copies the excellent choice of material he chose. It is striking how well Garth manages to make this thin but supple voice go over well on gravel-throated classics like \"Against the Wind\" and \"Midnight Rider.\" Good listening, even if it does leave me wanting to hear the originals again."
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H,B00GYAP848,5.0,"I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am over this box set! I have been waiting for a loooong while now for Garth to release a \"covers\" album.Sort of the same way Alan Jackson did with his \"Under The Influence\" CD and Dwight Yoakam with \"Under The Covers\".But this is not just some basic cover album with only ten or tweleve songs or so...this is an entire box set of covers!!! Not just country covers,but covers of rock favorites and classic soul music too!!! And to make it even better,this collection also contains dvds of Garth's music videos,a live show and even his double disc \"Ultimate Hits\" set that was released back in 2007!!! Garth does a great job covering these classic tunes.He covers everyone from Merle Haggard,to Hank Williams,to Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bob Seger,Billy Joel,Otis Redding...the list just goes on and on.Overall,if you are a Garth fan like me,then this box set is a must!!!! I cannot recommend it enough!!!! Buy it now!!! SIDE NOTE:Pick it up at Walmart or Walmart.com,because it's cheaper."
AZ22NJA3CRA39,B00GYJD0D0,4.0,Very mellow.  A folk rock with a taste of his country roots.  If your looking for rock this is not the one.  Good song writer
A2QS59REUZ5JXR,B00GYJD0D0,5.0,"This album is quite a departure from his earlier straight-up country efforts. Like a cross between Danny O'Keefe and Blaze Foley this mix of original songs and covers sounds new and original throughout, with catchy tunes and thought-provoking lyrics that each evoke a different mood and place and story."
A6Q2I0FYDDFVF,B00GZ6L48U,5.0,"Kin is a king hit by Pat Metheny, a stunning return to form with his group albums. Although this is not PMG it offers sublime compositional skills that feature the fantastic fusion of Chris Potter on sax that pays homage to the virtuoso Wayne Shorter. This is uplifting jazz at its best with tracks like Rise Up and Sign of the Season absolutely hitting the highs that only Metheny knows how to deliver. And then there's We Go On, such a catchy smooth jazz track that goes around and around in your head for days. The final moments of Rise Up are just so ecstatic and beseeching, this is Pat at his utmost best with Chris Potter in a phenomenal performance. All up as a previous reviewer said, this is a CD packed with powerful and amazing music. Metheny is the absolute master of the game!! Thank you Pat for an astounding group effort after all these years!"
A2XOV3ZKGDK55G,B00GZ6L48U,5.0,"Five UNIFYING Stars! Multiple Grammy-winning and Hall of Fame guitarist/leader Pat Metheny's 'Unity Band' was a great group where Metheny surrounded himself with a wonderful trio of inspirational young musicians, produced a marvelous Grammy-winning record, and stormed the clubs of the world on a 100+ date tour to show them off. He has brought them back and upped the ante by adding one multi-instrumentalist who can 'shape shift' between strings, brass, reeds, keyboards and vocals adding a new sonic palette to the already wide Metheny mix (especially when you add in the electronic Orchestrion). This recording is literally taking the group `back to the future' of Metheny's fusion days, but it's all new and inspiring to the group members, so it's very fresh sounding and exciting. The recording seems to use a unifying musical theme: `the family of man' and many 'world music' influences abound in every nook and cranny of this recording. Once again, we have polyrhythmic master drummer Antonio Sanchez, Chris Potter and his arsenal of tenor and soprano saxes and bass clarinet, upright and electric bass star Ben Williams' solid bottom underpinnings, and the new member Giulio Carmassi, who fits nicely into the group. Metheny has bravely stated he is seeking a unifying sound that encapsulates 'all' of his music going back as far as his \"Song X\" Ornette Coleman days and moving forward through his fusion days. It's risky, but he has for the most part achieved that lofty goal with the release of \"Kin (&lt;-->)\", although at times frankly it's not easy guessing who is playing during some instrumental solos, outside of the apparent guitar, sax, bass, and drum parts. And Carmassi's background piano `comping' is indeed a welcome new sound for this group.The 'best of the best', begins with the exciting 15 minute \"On Day One\", where right out of the shute we hear the sound of fluttering piano notes floating over the bass and drum, announcing the group's new member, and surging into a six-note staccato main theme that sets up a wild Potter tenor sax solo, some bracing Metheny guitar revelations, and Williams' heady interweaving solo (great \"Young at Heart\" quote). The beautiful \"Rise Up\" begins with flamenco guitar and hand clapping that kicks into a new gear for the solos, with a blazing Metheny solo and Potter on soprano sax for the theme and tenor sax for a laid back then intense tenor sax accounting. \"Adagia\" is a nice, short, but memorable unison guitar-sax themed song. \"Kin (&lt;-->)\" has a languid theme over Sanchez' urgent, accented rhythmic underpinning that is very effective, especially behind Carmassi's emotional synth solo, and a nice section that has Potter's tenor sax and Williams' arco bass trading solos. \"Born\" is a bluesy R&B-influenced; ballad that expands the album's repertoire away from fusion. The short \"Genealogy\" is a direct nod to Ornette Coleman and leads into an R&B-flavored; \"We Go On\" with a great funky Potter solo. The soulful \"Kqu\" has a loping beat for Metheny to explore his blues licks. In all, new guy Carmassi contributes excellent solos, nice background shadings, and is very empathetically unobtrusive in general. A great beginning to a new exciting Pat Metheny group that comes full circle with his `fusion' musical past. My Highest Recommendation. Five EXCELLENT Stars! (9 tracks;Time-70:17)"
A2QWF2BJ2FM4R2,B00GZAHGI8,5.0,"I had always liked the concept pf the DDGs more than their music. It was  nice but somehow I thought it lacked soul: it did not really rock, it was like some slowed down more poppy version of the Raveonettes mixed with the Gun Club...but worse. Here they have clearly matured musically: they deliver a graceful and spacey rock which is exactly the kind that I was expecting from Warpaint. This is a million times (somewhat exaggerated maybe) better."
A2C660ZXANGJA1,B00GZD6NMU,3.0,It's a good album.  I enjoyed it but don't see it staying in my rotation.  They are definitely better in a live setting.
A1ZMGV3E10PPZA,B00GZPIKGA,4.0,"When I first listened to the album, I was kind of disappointed but after over a month of listening to it - I really like it and it has grown on me.  I am really moved by the lyrics and rather disappointed in Frontiers and Amazon for not promoting it more - I found out it was released by accident.  I thought since James Christian just put out a really nice solo album, it would be awhile before they would put out another one but suddenly I saw it on the Frontiers site - which was how I found out Asia put out a new album too.  That man is nothing but prolific after that and his wife's solo album and beating cancer.  He's a true treasure for an old eighties rocker's iPod rotation.  Keep up the good work and stay cancer free, James.  Kudos to the rest of the band for their fantastic playing."
A1IND6C1TVNVC8,B00GZPIKGA,3.0,"I have been a House of Lords fan since day one. I saw them at their debut performance at the Sahara Hotel when they signed with Gene Simmons label. Most of their albums are excellent and some are inspired, while a couple didn't quite hit the mark. This is the latter, the potential is in there but most of the songs just sound tired. That said, the handful of great songs on this disc make it worth the price of admission."
A3U3W7URZU9259,B00GZQJ676,2.0,"Look, we all love Aretha Franklin, but Rhino/Atlantic continues recycling the same music that most of us already own. Instead of releasing a COMPLETE Box Set (like Columbia's 'Take a Look: Complete on Columbia' set!), Atlantic insists on dropping the ball when it comes to paying the Queen of Soul a PROPER CD Tribute and ignoring her last 4-5 albums on the label (from 'With Everything I Feel In Me' through 'LA Diva'). We know those albums didn't burn up the charts, but Atlantic is missing a golden opportunity to create a TRUE & all inclusive Box Set honoring Aretha Franklin. I WILL however give Rhino high marks for the 'Rare & Unreleased Recordings From the Golden Reign by Aretha Franklin' (2007), but they can keep this latest Greatest Hits set....SMH"
A332D1D6Q865XJ,B00H1IFCOS,5.0,"Good call Mark K reviewer.  Gonna get this.  Today's crap on the radio - well - I can't even listen to it.  I don't know what it is.  Bad rock with fiddles.  From the samples, this is the rare real deal we get nowadays,"
A1XEHVROJF2WG4,B00H1KE4Z4,5.0,"After this year's earlier &#34;Truant/Rough Sleeper&#34; EP, it was hard to imagine Burial could do it again, let alone even better. Guess what? He did. These tracks, especially the last two, are so full of warmth and hope that it's almost overwhelming. I found myself with tears in my eyes when I first heard &#34;Come Down to Us.&#34;He recently stated: &#34;I put my heart into the new EP, I hope someone likes it. I wanted the tunes to be anti-bullying tunes that could maybe help someone to believe in themselves, to not be afraid, and to not give up, and to know that someone out there cares and is looking out for them. So it's like an angel's spell to protect them against the unkind people, the dark times, and the self-doubts.&#34; (from NME.com)The above is evident, and the message gets stronger with each listen. Burial, you ARE an angel. Thank you."
A1VL282XIRMEEQ,B00H2A2T1O,3.0,"The War on Drugs' 2014 album \"Lost In The Dream\" is a fine piece of contemporary trance rock (to coin a new genre). Featuring long meandering pleasant sounding songs, \"Lost In The Dream\" reminds me most of Jakob Dylan's The Wallflowers. My top track pick, \"Red Eyes,\" features one of the shorter run times (five minutes) of the ten tracks that stretch to an hour of playing time. I concur with Rolling Stone's three star review while Allmusic not only awarded 4.5 stars, but an Album Pick designation. If you seek rock music by which to mellow-out by--and maybe fall asleep to--trance rock is your genre."
A5GC5R4H0WH69,B00H312VUQ,4.0,I guess I am different from most  I love his voice  I don't care what style he sings  he has the most beautiful voice and I loved real love the best also liked 1st track  a lot  any song that you really get to hear his voice.  definitely not what I expected from him  I did like him as a rocker but its the voice that sets him apart  If you listen to him sing the national anthem by himself you realize what a voice  hi probably should have been on that show  he would have won  but I am just so happy to have more of his work to enjoy  just hope he gets some air time  but he probably wont  what a shame
A1MMRCSGMV2S1P,B00H312VUQ,3.0,"I loved James Durbin's debut album and awaited with anticipation for his second release. But for those looking for another hard rocking blast of melodic tunes, look elsewhere. Durbin has opted for a safe, softer approach here, grinding out radio ready tunes that really don't stand out from many other albums in this genre. \"Parachute\" is a decent enough single, and \"Issues\" has some well thought-out lyrics, but overall this album does not sound like the passionate, metal-promoting Durbin on AI or on his debut. Even the two bonus tracks on iTunes are just more of the same. For those who want to hear what Durbin should be sounding like, check out the band The New Black and their EP Falling Forward (on Amazon at this link: http://www.amazon.com/Falling-Forward-The-New-Black/dp/B00F9CW6HY/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1397304180&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=the+new+black+falling+forward) for a a sound that is passionate, hard rocking, and melodic."
A2SE84FK9NZ6P5,B00H3GZMIE,1.0,"I was so excited for the better part of a year waiting for this guy's album to come out. I listened to Latch, La La La and Stay With Me. I was also prepared to listen to an album that was somewhat somber as he pretty much said as much in many interviews.What I didn't expect was a slew of songs that are beyond depressing and more to the point - just not that good. The only song worth listening to s Stay With Me. All of the rest will make you strongly consider either slitting your wrist or jumping off a bridge.Yeah, I get it. You love someone who doesn't love you back. Of course I get it - you beat me over the head with in practically every song. From being so excited about this to being truly disappointed.In The Lonely Hour does something remarkable. It captures the totally depressing nature of the album title. Which should be a great thing, right? Except it does it in the most uninteresting and uninspiring way. Whoever the guy is he loves, he should really just walk up to the guy and say so. Rather than subject me to this quite horrible album.Tell the guy you love him, Sam. Grow a pair of balls and tell the guy you love him, Sam.Listening to these songs, I don't want to relate to him. I just want to get away from him and his downer mood music. Apparently there are a ton of people who are depressed out there judging by all of the 4 star reviews. I would suggest to them going to therapy as a compliment to purchasing the album.In the Lonely Hour is pretty much a waste of an hour of your time. I think you are talented, Sam, but this roll up to the album release was all hype from your record label. I see that now. Those happier individuals were all duped."

A1Z2KXRBI9I619,B00H3JHE28,5.0,This is a fantastic live Heart album. Recorded during their Fanatic tour. Part of it feature a 5 piece string section and it really adds to what they do live and that's rock out. A must have for all Heart fans.
A21ZDHQ4IGJ1BR,B00H3JHEK0,5.0,"A fantastic release from one of the best prog-metal bands on the planet! Frankly, I didn't think it would be possible for Vanden Plas to transcend their previous effort, The Seraphic Clockwork, but they have certainly done so with Chronicles of the Immortals: Netherworld (Path One). With exceptionally beautiful vocals from Andy, brilliant instrumentation by Torsten, Andreas, and Gunter, and powerfully heavy guitar work from Stephan... this is nothing short of an epic masterpiece.Another spectacular concept album, this time penned by Andy and Germany's biggest-selling author, Wolfgang Hohlbein. The story evolves around an immortal being who desires only to be human, but is incapable of sharing his life with mortals. While wandering through the centuries searching for answers, he is confronted by a dark shape-shifter with the temptation of giving up his humanity forever to become a god.With hauntingly gorgeous melodies, lush orchestration, angelic vocal harmonies (featuring a special guest), a full choir,  and plenty of progressive inspiration, Netherworld is bound to win over thousands of new fans, while deeply satisfying long-time followers. I have lovingly enjoyed every release from Vanden Plas and remain astonished that each output somehow surpasses their last, while always remaining true to their unique sound.Very nicely done guys!"
A1KMYEXWGIPFWF,B00H48C73O,3.0,"Beautifully and elegantly packaged box set with 38 page booklet of story line, photos, tour posters etc.  CDs come individually digipak gatefold in different colors with song credits.  Front of disc is designed same as the case, very nice. Sound quality was claimed to have been improved from the previous release, I can't tell since I don't have the old copies but actually acceptable, clear and crispy not a bootlegged sound source. These were tape recordings from 1985 to 89 so you have a fledgling OT very different from their post Erpland.  My only concern is that all 6 cds are hard to tell apart from each other, they all sound the same. Many of the tracks are recurring in other cds so even listening attentively would be a challenge. In addition most of the cds are only 40 to 50 plus minutes in length and still have enough room for more material. At the current price of 40 dollars this is a good collection since the physical presentation of the box is excellent but the content is limited as OT in its early stage and does not really represent their utmost band performance. They still have to come up with a comprehensive box set that will cover the entire career collectively and currently. If the price balloons over $50 better collect the individual albums or wait for the next box set."
A30RI0AJ4CQBU1,B00H4BVPUM,4.0,"The new DBT is the first in awhile with a 50/50 split between the band's two singer-songwriters.  Mike Cooley steps up with six songs to Patterson Hood's seven, and sings one of Hood's songs.  They continue with earthy tales of the struggles and foibles of the working class, conveying compassion and a clearly left-of-center perspective that could not be more welcome given the current efforts in the South to deny health care to the poor.The album opens strong with three great songs -- Cooley's \"S*** Shots Count\" and perhaps my favorite, \"Primer Coat,\" sandwiching Hood's \"When He's Gone.\"  The closing is another three strong songs -- Hood's poignant \"When Walter Went Crazy,\" followed by Cooley's lovely \"First Air of Autumn\" about getting older, and concluding with Hood's \"Grand Canyon,\" a moving tribute to Craig Lieske, a long-time member of the band's crew who recently died.  The entire album is dedicated to his memory.The middle section is not all up to the same standard.  Cooley's \"Hearing Jimmy Loud\" is a great rocker, one of the best songs on the album.  Hood's \"Hanging On\" and Cooley's \"Natural Light\" are both fine if lesser songs, expressing tenderness and a relationship grown distant.  The Hood song that Cooley sings is weak -- \"Til He's Dead or Rises.\"The two most political songs, back to back, both fall short for contrasting reasons.  Hood's \"The Part of Him\" is a sketch of an amoral, ambitious politician that is too obvious and simple to be effective.  On the other hand Cooley's \"Made Up English Oceans\" is a cryptic monologue that is apparently, based on reviews I've read, supposed to be the infamous GOP operative Lee Atwater.  While the narrator's contemptuous attitude is clear, and the target is clear -- the manipulation of \"low information\" voters using male pride and religion -- crucial specifics are opaque:\"6X9 and counting down in one after the otherthey'll go running up and down the road, angry as their mothersover senseless acts of selfishness on made up English oceansand made up English stomach contents tied to senseless notions\"What does this mean?  The image used as the title of the song and the album makes no sense to me -- a senseless notion?  In the end, though, both songs are also weak musically, and so there is little to compensate for the problems with the lyrics.If you compare the photo of the current band in the CD foldout to the photo in the CD foldout of \"Decoration Day\" from 2003 one of the biggest changes is obvious -- \"English Oceans\" is the expression of older and wiser men, now with families.  The happy-go-lucky smiles have been replaced with pensive concern.  They grieve for the friend they've lost, they have a care in the world.  Though the basic framework and content remains the same, the attitude has changed.It works just fine, because the DBT was never just a good-time band.  They've always written serious lyrics addressing social problems.  They still rock as before, but the edge of anger and indignation has seemingly been partly replaced by resignation and stoicism.I missed the Athens kickoff of the current tour, but I'm hoping they swing back through Atlanta before they finish!"
A2RQLEIVZW63D2,B00H4BVPUM,5.0,I am really starting to dig this band. they have honest sound and a wholesome feel that you just don't find in music anymore . like the songs actually have some background to them.
A1AL15PY5AVFNX,B00H4BVPUM,5.0,"12th album from legendary Athens, Georgia band&#8212;Drive-By Truckers are the poets ofcontemporary Southern guitar rock.  I know it sounds unlikely, but this is intelligent &#8220;good-old-boy&#8221; rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll.  Patterson Hood & Mike Cooley write lyrics that dig way below the surface ofday-to-day small town existence, with an insightfulness that brings the words to life.  ImagineLynyrd Skynyrd with a degree in creative English literature.  Yeah, and then there&#8217;s the music!Tight, anthemic, confident Southern roots rock with guitars that alternately sparkle and rage insuch a smoothly integrated way that the whole song tends to quietly explode with a subtle,muscular power.  Some similarities to Hold Steady, Wilco, Bruce Springsteen, Water Liars, NeilYoung & Crazy Horse, the Band, Johnny Cash, Allman Brothers Band, The Dexateens.  Withinthe genre, and even beyond it, this is as good as it gets.  Drive-By Truckers are a gift to becherished by thoughtful rockers everywhere.  Superb."

A3U3PA6J2XOVFK,B00H4BVPUM,5.0,"One of America's finest bands delivers again. A strong, powerful, triumphant album that's packed with memorable songs. Some rockers, some ballads, some reflective tunes, some absolutely beautiful songs, passionate lyrics; this album has it all.The biggest change on this album is the departure of bassist/singer Shona Tucker, a member who I had become quite impressed with on recent albums. And yet, her absence is more than compensated by the strength of the mighty core duo of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, who offer some of their finest material in several years. Many people have remarked about the album's moving closing song, &#34;Grand Canyon.&#34; And for sure, that's one of the best songs that DBT have ever done. But for me, the real jewel on this album is Mike Cooley's &#34;Primer Coat.&#34; It's one of those songs that sneaks into your head and stays there, and grows and grows some more. An absolutely stunning piece of music.This may not be the most rockin' album that DBT have recorded, but it ranks up there with some of their best efforts. This band continues to adapt and impress. They make my smile, they make my cry, they make my stomp my feet and dance; all the trademarks of a truly important band. This is one to savor."
A3RBDWLTR2A5VR,B00H4BVPUM,4.0,"This is the most solid and consistent effort since &#34;Dirty South&#34;. Although &#34;Go Go Boots&#34; grew on me and had a few outstanding tunes, it, like most others, was undermined by the inclusion of Shonna Tucker's songs. I hate to diss her, but her songs always reminded me of throw ins and often disrupted whatever flow the album might have. I am sorry Shonna. This album has a much more fluid feel to it and rolls right along with great story telling and rock and roll. Patterson's solo album &#34;Heat Lightning&#34; remains one of my favorite albums of the past couple years and &#34;English Oceans&#34; is definitely a step in the right direction for the Truckers. They are one of the few bands that I always check out and I recommend this album to anyone looking for a good songwriter/ R&R experience."
A13LQXSU90UCWS,B00H4BVPUM,5.0,"... which comes from one of the songs, I love everything about this record.  Tucker having left, Isbell long gone, the songs are split pretty equally between Hood (he has 2 more) and Cooley, and that's just fine.  Barbe has an interesting sound as a producer, clear and well-mixed, but simple and with an odd feel of lo-fi, and it really suits such a song-oriented band, who play like one of the greatest bar-bands in the world.  Every DBT record is my fave DBT record, as is this."
A6OUWU2TYT8UR,B00H4F2UPC,4.0,"i love bands like cynic, voivod, king's x, atheist, and opeth because they adhere to the idea ofprogression without fail, each album is differentand each band grows with each new set of experiences.4 stars for KBTFU because its a little too meandering at times,and alot of the production is that home studio feel, where everythingis done on headphones, so i love hearing it on phonesbut listening to it in the car can be unsatisfying..another album like that is target earth by voivod..the myriad of different sounds is an adventurein composition but some of the sounds are muddy or distant in the car..great band, musicianship, career trajectory.."
A12AMEYS95OREQ,B00H51BJFW,3.0,"I've really enjoyed the past few offerings Bombay Bicycle Club have given us; they have an incredibly diverse music catalogue and I encourage you to check out their past albums if you've only just started here. But this album... this album, is splendid. Every track offers something different: some are dancey, some are slow jams, some are just plain wonderful. Songs I particularly take a liking to are Come To, Feel, Overdone and Whenever Wherever. I highly recommend this album. It's ineffable."
A2TIZW2VDFZNMB,B00H59ASTM,3.0,"I'm a huge fan of their first 2 albums.  This one just doesn't do it.  And it's not because of Shaley's voice missing either...  The new guy is very good too.  Musically, it's just lacking.  The hard screams are non-existent.  The loud riffs are gone in favor of more power chord stuff...  musically, it's half of what the previous albums were.There's 2 or 3 good tracks.  the rest of it gets a big MEH from me, and I hope the follow up to this one in a year or two is WAY better."
A19HO4C4XBHBDL,B00H59ASTM,5.0,"This album is great! Aaron Pauley adds his amazing vocals to make this album even more spectacular. Great people, great music, definitely pick this up."
A291VBC71GGGI0,B00H5D52VC,4.0,"as a big fan of Johnny Cash I look forward to everything that hasn't been released yet. This album is the 'old' Johnny Cash: from before the American recordings (which I also truely love). It's got a full, warm athmosphere with beautifull songs. I'm happy with it!"
A1WUD42VKWASYG,B00H5D52VC,5.0,I really enjoyed this compendium of Cash music which had never been released before.  I am not the biggest Cash fan in the world but this was worth buying.

AGOIS4LC6AY9I,B00H5NY7EU,5.0,"Here's the deal. I liked this band a little on their first album. There were three songs I liked, and nothing else appealed to me. I've listend to their other releases, but disliked everything. I gave this acoustic cd a chance and, despite me not liking about 96% of their music, I love this CD for some reason. It's very good. It has great atmosphere."
A16M9VXDV4Q2Q2,B00H5NY7EU,4.0,"First off, I love this band.  I would highly recommend any of their stuff.  I think this album CD is very, very good but it seems sort of incomplete.  Maybe it's me but with live albums I like to hear everything, the intro, the banter between songs and this is just the songs live one after the other.  Still it's great but could be a little bit better"
ACO26JQ366659,B00H5VN6GC,5.0,"I greatly enjoyed the movie and the title song Everything is Awesome is very catchy.A lot of the music on here is instrumental, so it may not be to everyone's liking, especially as it is also techno mixes.Being a fan of the movie, this is just picking up one more thing related to it.You'll have 3 different versions of Everything is Awesome and then Batman's song: &#34;Untitled Self Portrait&#34; with the rest all being instrumental pieces heard throughout the movie."
AH8NA6Q46XXBP,B00H5VN6GC,4.0,"Okay I'll Admit it was VERY GOOD. My family went and saw the movie and it was a gas. Okay the ending is visible fifteen minutes in to an adult. But it kept our son guessing all the way and rooting for Emmitt. Now here's the rub. DANG the music. I'm four days removed from the movie and all I can say is &#34;Everything Is Awesome&#34;! The tune is stuck in my head, my wife's head and I'm sure everyone that was it theatre that day is just as infected.The songs aid in moving you from Lego City, to Lego Old West, The Pirates, etc. as the movie incorporates just about every product they have. Watching how they make Lego explode or simulate showers are great. So until, Amazon sells the movie we'll have to be happy with Batman lamenting about his dark childhood and the death of his parents, &#34;but being rich didn't hurt. And anyways who cares because EVERYTHING is AWESOME when your part of a team and that is very good.."
A3URCC2KJNGK92,B00H5VN6GC,3.0,"2013 was an extremely saturated year for CGI animated movies, with late summer releases like Turbo and Planes underperforming at the box office thanks to the fact that family audiences had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new animated movies that summer. Arriving in the first quarter of 2014, Warner Bros.' &#8220;The Lego Movie&#8221;, along with Disney's &#8220;Frozen&#8221; from winter 2013, reaffirmed the reliable financial power of CGI animated films. The Lego Movie opened to astounding numbers at the box office and managed to snag the best reviews of any animated movie since perhaps Pixar's Toy Story 3. Providing music for the film was Mark Mothersbaugh, a veteran of animated movies whose last high profile project was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. His job would be to accompany the stylish, witty film, which featured awesome animation resembling real-life Lego blocks, with fitting music that would undoubtedly have to take a few departures from standard animated score fare. In this regard he's no doubt earned his paycheck. The score he churned out heavily features EDM and dubstep music that is remarkably proficient; while I'm no connoisseur of music from those genres, my untrained ear thinks some of these cues could pass off as serious beats from electronica's premier artists. The standout cue for me personally was track #5 &#8220;Escape&#8221; which is an electronica/dubstep action cue that must've been quite an awesome accompanient to the scene in the film. The main theme of the score is taken from the original song heard in the first track &#8220;Everything is AWESOME&#8221; sung by Tegan and Sara, and is developed adequately. Otherwise, any other themes he writes (I think I picked up a couple) are poorly enunciated and fail to make an impression.The cues on the album that are strictly orchestra are also much more by-the-numbers than the tracks that integrate electronics, which is disappointing; surely this movie requires zest and energy from all of its music. The lack of memorable themes and underachieving orchestral writing take this score's stature down a peg, and the lack of themes in particular is a loss of a big opportunity considering this movie is almost certain to spawn multiple sequels over the next years; I'm a sucker for franchise scores that appropriately set up sequels, and any composer working on &#8220;Lego 2&#8221; will have trouble mining any material from this score that audiences will actually remember. Mothersbaugh also missed an opportunity to incorporate theme music from the franchises that are represented in the film by Lego characters such as Lego Batman, Lego Dumbledore, and Lego Star Wars characters. There are very few occasions where using a dubstep Star Wars theme parody is highly appropriate, and this was one of them. Given the fact that the film licensed the characters, surely WB also could have licensed the music, assuming legal problems were what prevented it from happening. Or maybe it just didn't cross the filmmakers' minds. Still, this was a score that would have benefited from such a fun and electic approach. Despite these disappointments, I am highly impressed by the highly effective electronica music in this album which represents a fresh approach to scoring the music for a genre that's starting to become a bit repetitive in its clich&eacute;-ridden scores. This score won't linger on any dedicated film score fan's mind for long but it's definitely an entertaining product to behold in a bleak early 2014."
A12IJZQ0FLTVFW,B00H7EV49S,5.0,"Sure, I had all of these from their original 80's and 90's CD releases, and even a few from their special edition releases with bonus tracks.  However, I HAD to have these remasters along with the new, previously recorded but never released CD (The Sicilian Defence).  I wasn't disappointed.  Great sound, remastered by the master, himself... Alan Parsons!  No other bonus tracks, but the new (old) album was enough, as most of the previous bonus tracks on reissues were bare and lacked the production values that we love about APP in the first place.  Great price on Amazon (pre-buy).  Saves space in one box.  Allowed me to gift my old CD versions to my daughter and her husband to remind them of APP's place in modern music history."
A1KCH0MSPPCXNU,B00H7EV49S,3.0,"I didn't want to give this low of a rating, but I would have loved to buy their first two releases (Tales of Mystery and Imagination - Edgar Allan Poe & I Robot) in 5.1 on Blue Ray or DVD AUDIO.  I did contact their site a few years ago and they replied that it's cost prohibited.  You would think someone like Alan could do most of the mixing and mastering himself to cut down a lot of the cost.  I really wouldn't mind seeing a few more of his collection in surround.  If somebody knows somebody to talk to about this, I would appreciate it.  Feel free to comment.  Thanks!"
A21E8F3G6F0PVG,B00H7IMBBO,5.0,"If you liked Drink the Sea...this is like an evolution of that sound.  There are clear references to their original sound, but The Glitch Mob has successfully branched into a new overall feel.  To me, it definitely has clear dubstep influences, but without the awful, unmusical parts of dubstep, such as the tone-deaf whirring and whining parts that make me want to impale my ear drums, nor the over-the-top twenty-plus-measure build-ups to unimaginative drops.  Additionally, Love Death Immortality comes with several more features than the previous album and all of them are fantastic.  If you were hoping for the exact same sound as Drink the Sea, you will be largely disappointed.  But if you like to keep an open mind, you simply must possess this album."
A289KF2DQWIDRI,B00H7MW2SM,4.0,"Rock-and-Roll-Audrey-Hepburn Annie Clark's fourth album as St. Vincent is a colorful wall of interlocking fuzz guitar bits and analog synths that pays tribute to a diverse number of classic rock performers but never feels quite like an homage. As a huge Beatles fan newly smitten with David Byrne (work on this album was begun a mere thirty-six hours after returning giddy and recharged from her tour with the ex-Talking Head / Luaka Bop founder), it should surprise no one that Clark highlights a New Wave Funk via 'Let It Be Naked' vibe all over this record. However, in what may seem like a cop-out to those just getting warmed up to that idea, Clark then unexpectedly balances the heat these influences put off by frequently dipping them in the demure blue tones of Kate Bush, creating a steamy song-by-song clash of sexuality that makes the otherwise constrained record somewhat difficult to pin down at first.That she dabbles in tightly-wound badassery here was apparent from the moment she released single \"Birth In Reverse\" two months ago -  that song's sweet breakdown in the bridge remains a cranked-up highlight of the album  -- but the alternating back and forth between aggressive house-cleaning music and sensual bath-taking music creates such a chemically volatile atmosphere of grownup \"me time\" that a new version of the St. Vincent archetype now emerges: the unapproachable mother. Indeed, by including another round of light moral guiding of the sort that appear on all St. Vincent's albums coupled with the reality that she is getting older and wiser, it is getting harder and harder to avoid feeling like we're all Clark's lost children. Not a bad gig, really.When squeaky clean Clark tries to get naughty through verses like \"Oh, what an ordinary day / take out the garbage, masturbate,\" it's easy to feel some sense of embarrassment at the attempt, like the scene in 'Fargo' where a furious but hopelessly gentle midwestern couple struggles with all their might to openly curse at William H. Macy's swindling used car dealer. These frequent bursts of very mild shock seem so passe compared to crass rap lyrics floating around the mind of an adult listener that he/she is left with no choice but to compartmentalize them as immature \"teenager bait\" in the same way a Green Day or Taylor Swift record may seem rebellious to a naive set of virgin ears. But it's still difficult to say if the album is any better or worse for including them than if it had taken either a more or less severe tone.Another juvenile wildcard thrown in the mix is the near-reliance on kitschy synthesizers - mostly from late Beatles standbys the Moog and Mellotron -- to make subtle backdrops for the songs. While perusing this month's music releases, it is painfully obvious that the music war between anthemic Synthesizer Pop and bewildered Folk revivalism has ended cruelly with the entire music landscape drenched in sawtooth bass leads (and Dubstep in Pop Tart commercials). The public's desire to accept further iterations of this grimy, simplistic commercialism is at a breaking point, and smart artists like Clark are sitting wisely between worlds with their inclusion of neutral vintage synthesizers until the next big thing (perhaps demonstrations of sobering tightness from Jazz, Punk, Bossa Nova, Vintage Country, and Rockabilly that allow for more complex melodies and rhythms yet can still \"opt in\" for closed, short, synthesizer syncopation like the organ work of Walt Wanderley) takes hold.But, the one thing that will decide whether or not you'll fully embrace St. Vincent's new album is how comfortable you are listening to her worship David Byrne. Dyeing her grey and rocking shoulderpads to match his is one thing, but the lyrical content of these songs definitely revolves around a harmless, girlish infatuation with someone. In the wake of her recent tour and the impact it had on her, and the steady inclusion of signature Byrne elements that pop up on the record, it is hard not to think while listening that the two were/are romantically involved (however unlikely that may be), with all the attached curiosity and sympathy that follow the exposure of celebrity couples throughout history playing in the listener's head alongside the music.Though not perfect, you'd be hard pressed (as I was) to find a better record out this month. Clark may be a goddess trying to dork out a little here, but she's still a goddess, and her love of record crafting prevents any light missteps on this record from spoiling the presentation overall. Her guitar playing, ever approaching outright ferocity, is an absolute joy to listen to as it continues to gain momentum, and through her fuzz and octave pedals, it's difficult to know where the synths begin and the guitars end, often giving the proceedings a wonderful \"Mother Popcorn\" bass and drum pocket. The record sounds better after each listen, especially on a warm, loud household stereo, and while not the \"party record\" it was intended to be, is perfect for a private, household, \"inner-world\" party of one. It's a beefy, voyeuristic snapshot through the mind of an enormously talented pop star caught between the tickled excitement of youth, love, sexual fantasy, and impending full-on, world-nurturing adulthood.David Byrne is pretty awesome, goofy keyboards are kind of fun, and electric guitars do kick ass, so while not entirely indefensible, the album makes Annie Clark more human and understandable than ever. It's easier to point out cracks in the seams of the S.S. St. Vincent than it is to do the right thing and wholeheartedly praise her hard work and revere her talent. The album's strongest suit is its drumming, by Homer Steinweiss of Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and McKenzie Smith of Midlake, as they can be thanked for providing the album with a solid, cohesive caption despite Clark's dueling ambitions of sound. It's a tad frontloaded, but the songs on the B-Side at least retain sheer musicality and provide elaboration on earlier themes. To give this record a negative review over trifles - especially considering the killer bottom end and solidity it has going on - would be truly criminal, so I won't do it. She shoots, she scores! It's good!"
A1HWMU2XORHEI4,B00H7MW2SM,5.0,"Oh Annie Clark, I think you're pretty super. I've thought you were pretty super ever since 2007. You were this sorta weird and quirky girl that was so way cooler than me. You played the guitar the way I wish I could've played. You made each fuzzed-out riff and melody seem effortless, while I'd make it seem like work and slightly(completely)pretentious. You walked that fine line between artistic achievement and pop sensibiltiy. You're like this bizarro version of the popular girl at school. You could hang out with the jocks and the in-crowd; yet you could also talk about your favorite Siouxsie Sioux and King Crimson record with the goths and prog kids. You came out of the gate like a fully-formed artistic force. There was no mistaking that twinkle in your eye. Marry Me was your introduction, while Actor was your mission statement. You don't know this, but I saw you in 2009 open for Andrew Bird. I'll just say this, our Topiary-loving friend didn't have a chance. He spent his portion of the evening licking his wounds and pretending to be a rock star just to save face from the blistering set you opened the evening up with. Strange Mercy felt like a victory lap, mixed with all the idiosyncrasies and indelible pop finesse you've sharpened like a deadly weapon over the last four years. After a David Byrne collaboration that seemed like a match made in a heaven David Lynch would create you have returned with St. Vincent, a self-titled album that shows you in your finest form yet. Okay, I'll leave you alone now Annie. Gonna talk about your new record.&#34;Rattlesnake&#34; opens St. Vincent on a funky note, with a sound like a cross between interstellar disco and 80s King Crimson. Annie Clark has made this kind of sound -organic mixed with a processed flair- her calling card. &#34;Birth In Reverse&#34; is a wonky and manic track that sports this great line &#34;Oh what an ordinary day/ Take out the garbage, masturbate/ I'm still holding for the laugh.&#34; &#34;Prince Johnny&#34; is more of a slow burner. Again, she writes these exquisite lines that are both poetic and subversive. &#34;Remember the time we went and snorted/ A piece of the Berlin Wall that you'd extorted/ And we'd had such a laugh of it/ Prostrate on my carpet.&#34; She writes words like a writer, not a lyricist. Broken people looking for love; looking for something to hold onto. I hear a track like &#34;Huey Newton&#34; and could see a St. Vincent and Trent Reznor partnership birthing something quite wonderful. Throughout Clark's career there has always been this underlying base of industrial barb wire. Halfway through &#34;Huey Newton&#34; the guitar gets this red-lined blow out sound as if it's about to melt the speakers, while Clark pumps up the attitude and machismo in her voice. It's a genius track, really. And &#34;Digital Witness&#34;? Her time spent with David Byrne shows in the tight horn section, while the chorus brings up echoes of 80s disco. And her guitar? Reznor, are you listening? &#34;I Prefer Your Love&#34; is a beautiful track written for Clarks's mom. &#34;I, I prefer your love to Jesus&#34; Clark sings over synth strings and a simple beat. Next to &#34;Marry Me&#34; it's one of her most sublime tracks yet.St. Vincent from start to finish shows Annie Clark at her best. Each album she's released since 2007 has been a progression; an evolution into more of the artist she's supposed to be. St. Vincent has released one of the best albums of the year, and the best of Annie Clark's career yet.And Annie, I think Andrew Bird wants a rematch. It's the least you can do."
A37Z81LW79DUZ8,B00H7MW2SM,4.0,"If you're familiar with St. Vincent, I think this is her least accessible album. The beats are really zany and hard to hook with, but it is a fun and wild. It has your typical quirky lyrics, experimental sounds, talking heads inspired beats, dreamy/atmospheric beats, funny songs and theatrical. She deserves all the credit for trying hard to change the sound of things and keeping things fresh. It is very much avante garde inspired and energy filled. There are many complex and simple layers to her music. I hope as she grows older and matures her music strips of her quirkiness and grows into the purely moody atmospheric stuff she writes, it's very touching and heartfelt. It always feels like the second half of all her albums gets slower, sensitive, and loving towards the end. She has a really big soft caring heart nobody seems to mention, it's overshadowed by her strange quirkiness.some of Her music can pull you into hypnotic moody dream states.This is one of the best promising/indie acts around today. Thanks for being so prolific: 5 albums in 7 years."
A52R33XUB86BO,B00H7MW31S,5.0,I love Lea's voice on Glee and was so excited to see her record this CD. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves music.
A1B6RAQC4EA5DN,B00H7MW31S,5.0,I'm a proud Gleek but lea has such an awesome voice  I like her show tunes in glee best  sebum good though
A1GUX6R8DV3ZLY,B00H7MW31S,4.0,"I don't watch Glee but I have run across clips of Glee and enjoy Lea Michele's voice.  I enjoyed her debut album very much but, as discussed below, tLea could have done better.  The album has too many run of the mill Pop tracks worthy of Katy Perry, which is fine for Katy Perry but someone as talented as Lea Michele can do better.  However, on balance the songs ARE good.  In fact, there are a few songs that are very good.  Lea's voice is lovely and the songs are not vulgar (as a Mom, this is a big plus - the whole family enjoys this album).- Cannonball:  This track is a catchy pop song.  It's not musically outstanding by any means, but it is good.  4 stars because it is enjoyable.- On My Way:  This track is a Katy Perry caliber pop song (her \"hearts too drunk to drive\".  The song is not musically outstanding, but enjoyable.  3.5 stars- Burn with You:  This song has some more \"mature\" themes about hellfire, but overall, it's pretty good. 3.5 stars- Battlefield:  This is one of the better songs on the album in my opinion. It's a ballad and I think Lea's voice is best suited for ballads. 4.5 stars- You're Mine:  This is also one of the better songs.  It's up beat but works well with Lea's voice.  There are times where she sounds a bit like Celine Dion.  4 stars.- Thousand Needles:  This song showcases Lea's voice nicely.  I think it is really good and is one of the darker songs on the album.  One of the best songs in the album.  4.5 stars.- Louder:  This is an upbeat, Katy Perry type song.  It's good, not outstanding.  However, it is my 9 year old's favorite track on the album.  3.5 stars.- Cue the Rain:  This is another love song, but the lyrics are a bit better than some of the other songs on the album.  4 stars.- Don't Let Go:  Yet another Katy Perry style pop song.  It's fine.  Nothing special.  3.5 stars.- Empty Handed:  I liked this one a lot.  I think the piano sounds really nice and it really does justice to Lea's voice.  4 stars.- If You Say So:  This is the best song on the album vocally and the best song by far in terms of the lyrics.  It's about Cory and Lea's last conversation and you can feel Lea's heartbreak in the song.  The Lyrics and vocals are both very strong.  5 stars.In sum, the album is pleasant and enjoyable.  I just wish that Lea had done something more musically interesting, given her talent.  Lea's voice is better than Katy Perry and other pop divas and I wish she showed off a bit more.  That said, I can't rate the album lower than 4 stars simply because it really is better than her competitor's pop albums.  That said, it's mostly forgettable with the exception of the haunting \"If You Say So.\""
A1QA8CFOV2I62J,B00H7MW3HC,5.0,"Her melodies are pretty, her singing is excellent, harmony is lovely, and accompaniment is rich.  This new album is as wonderful as her first ones.  And it's a relief to know she's continuing her work."
A3AFNPL8179FV3,B00H7MW3HC,5.0,"Last year I was lucky enough to see Christina Perri live as she was the opening act for Jason Mraz. I didn't really know who she was at the time, but after seeing her and hearing her, I was a fan! She is GREAT! This album is a fantastic and beautiful album from the talented Christina Perri. Well worth buying, just as good if not better than her first album. Every song on the cd has melody, structure and they all seem to flow together beautifuly. They are all very well written, too, and they each have a story to tell. There's not a bad song on the whole cd! Probably my favorite song so far is \"burning gold.\" The cd has a really pleasant, natural melodic flow to it, and Christiana's beautiful voice always conveys just the emotion she's looking for. All in all, if you liked her first cd, this one is a must have as well! Great!"
A9XZIV87QU46P,B00H7MW3HC,5.0,"I&#8217;m one of those fans that was anticipating the return of Christina Perri, with her addictive indie flow and that versatile and meaningful music. This woman deserves more recognition for her art and I&#8217;m pleased to be able to not only listen to her sophomore album, but to write a review as well. No bias. Just appreciation for authentic sound that needs to be appreciated.***Love that gritty feeling that plunges in with the opening guitar strings in Trust. Then once the melodies hook you, Christina leaps in with these skin-tingling vocals. What I enjoy about her sound is not only the subtleness, where the songs aren&#8217;t overdone with all these instruments or beats in the background, but I love her clarity and ability to connect on a unique level. Trust is almost like a part two to Jar of Hearts. It certainly plays on that ache and moving on from it, because Christina sings about learning to trust and knowing that its hard but she has to move on from it.Burning Gold picks up the tempo and is all about empowerment and knowing when to say goodbye to the things that hurt and won&#8217;t uplift you.Be My Forever is a wonderfully sweet and romantic duet with Ed Sheeran. This song is already a fan favorite and is garnering lots of attention for its flowy harmonies, catchy hook, and groovy beat. I also love that happy go lucky vibe depicted throughout the song, and towards the end you actually hear some laughter. It gives you this warm, fuzzy feeling inside and you&#8217;ll keep listening and remembering it even after you close your eyes. Love it.When I heard Human, I was like whoa! Christina Perri is back! I absolutely love this song and cannot get enough of it. This song is always on blast when I put it on and that has been every day since its release. Such a beautiful production with heartfelt and realistic lyrics, not to mention there&#8217;s so much energy that derives from every aspect of the song. These are the kind of songs I want to hear playing on the radio. Something of purpose and deep, substantial meaning.While the previous brought us back down a tad to a more mellow vibe, One Night brings it up a notch. This song has so much going for it, including metaphoric terms of what Christina wants to represent in her relationship. Love the backing addlibs and sensual she sounds. It&#8217;s a more intimate track I would say. I like it, but need a few more listens to really fall in love with it.Okay, the power returns in I Don&#8217;t Wanna Break. Love the rush it sends through my body. The musical arrangement is just phenomenal. This is most definitely in contention to become a single as well. It&#8217;s solid and can stand on its own, especially among a generation who loves to dance. The song is about going through everything together; loving, living, breaking together. Great message. Great song.Sea of Lovers is the next ballad on the album. Breathtaking. Invigorating. Thought-provoking. It gives you all the emotional feels you can think of. Christina&#8217;s lyrics are as poetic as ever. They tug at the heart. I think this is a perfect transition from the previous because its also about not letting go. Such a sweet love song.For some reason, I keep waiting to hear maybe a downfall or a track that just doesn&#8217;t fit on the album and sounds like filter, but I can&#8217;t find that. It&#8217;s magnificent production so far, especially when The Words come in. Another ballad, yet even more powerful than the previous. I think the haunting strings are what really captivate me in the beginning. It opens up my heart and mind and make me want to soak in whatever comes next, which is absolute bliss. Once again, no abundant of instruments or effects, its just the singer, her piano, and violin. If the ballads were about love and the depth of it, this one takes that up to a much higher level. It&#8217;s a spine-chilling dedication to someone who means the world to her. This is the anthem for couples. In my opinion, its about honesty and moving forward.Lonely Child springs forth the groovy segment of the album. Love the latin influence in this alternative rock, pop song. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure how I&#8217;d feel about the track when the beat first came in. Then once the artist brought forth those catchy verses and addictive hook, I was filled with an uncontrollable rhythm and I couldn&#8217;t help but dance. Those guitar riffs during the breakdown is the highlight of the song. I love the sexy appeal and laid back arrangement. It makes me want to come back for seconds.Run captures that gritty and fierce persona I first heard in Jar of Hearts. When she takes off during the second first, I felt every emotion. I was like man, Christina Perri means business. The song is relaxed in the way it is arranged, but electrifying in all sense. Love the words. Love the concept. Love the dramatic production because it emphasizes on the purpose of the track.The journey continues with the celestial Butterfly. It sounds like a fairytale; I envision the artist walking through a field as she sings from the bottom of her heart, about making mistakes and learning form them. The choir-like harmonies are melancholy and represents the beauty of butterflies. It&#8217;s bittersweet in a way, because even though the song is called butterfly, the words tell a story about a guy who uses lines to try to win her over and may eventually hurt her, but Christina is smart and already sees beneath his charms. Once again, good message.So throughout the album, I heard a story of the ups and down of love. In Shot Me in the Heart, the relationship is over. He&#8217;s broken her heart and she&#8217;s done with him. Christina sings about doing her best and investing a lot into her love. She&#8217;s at a lost at how it ended up going downhill, but she only wants him to leave her alone because he&#8217;s really done a number on her heart. I like how she makes the music playful, yet the words are sad. If anything, the uptempo music arrangement is take away from the sorrow ballad the song could have been instead.The album concludes with the powerful number, I believe. It makes you feel like rising again after being down and low after a period of time. It&#8217;s good to believe things will get better and do the best you can to achieve all you want and do what you want. There&#8217;s also a message to hang on when you think you absolutely can&#8217;t. Christina&#8217;s saying she&#8217;s with you, has experienced that low as well, and you&#8217;ll get through it like she did. My gosh the lyrics are deep and honest. You really feel that message when it gets to the bridge she carries us out with &#8221;This is not the end of me, this is the beginning&#8230;&#8221; true words indeed. There&#8217;s no way you can dislike such a song. I see another single here. Superb way to wrap up a well-delivered and magnificently constructed album."
A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00H7NN19U,5.0,"Better isn't the right word.  Is Stereotype A better than Viva La Woman?  Well, er, no.  They're both great albums but they're so unique in their own right that you can't compare them.  It would be like comparing a vodka martini made by your favorite blonde bartender with a sailboat ride on San Francisco Bay.  They're two totally different experiences.So what is one to say about Hotel Valentine?  Is this album better than the first two, fourteen years after they broke up?  Well, er, no.  But is it totally completely different and great?  YEAH!  Yes, it is another incredible unique experience and different from the first two, and a major surprise after all of these years.  It may not be as weird as Viva, and it may not be as sophisticated as Stereotype, but man, it is plenty weird and plenty sophisticated.  Who would have expected these two genius girls would still be so great?The thing is, you have to give it a little time.  Oh, yeah, sure, to one with a rock and roll mind, some of the cuts were immediately accessible.  The first song, Check In, is a very great rock song;  and 20th Floor Ghost Girl, the third, is a very great heavier rock song.  Try to stay off your feet.  But the others . . . hmmm.  Song two is D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, a jazzy sort of thing, kind of reminiscent of Stereo Type A, with a hip-hop thing in the middle.  Initially, ehh, so what?  But after a few listens, it may be the catchiest song on the album.  Hotel Valentine, MFN and Lobby have moments when they are a little discordant, but again, listen to them a few times and you will suddenly find certain passages and lyrics bouncing around in your head all day long.  When Miho sings, \"Don't tell me what to do I'm a ghost, don't throw your ******* oyster shells at me,\" try not to sing along.  Of course, Empty Pool is one of the most beautiful songs they've ever done--which is saying a lot--with its lovely lyrics, melody, and vocal.The main thing is the sound.  There is so much going on in every song.  At any moment you can focus in and find so many interesting things to listen to.  Really, Yuka is a genius.  She gets just about everything there is to get out of her keyboard-synthesizer-electronic thing--whatever it is--and everything is perfectly in place.  Oh, and throw in some expertly placed horns and superb percussion, drumming and bass, and you have the complete picture.  One song after the other, whether you initially like the melody or groove or not, will eventually catch your attention and wonder.Miho is as usual a spectacular vocalist and it finally occurs to one that she has a lot more to do with Cibo Matto than just her vocal.  It would appear that she is the one who created the melodies out of Yuka's elaborate soundscape, and also the lyrics which are just as perfect as everything else;  reflecting whimsy, humor, poignancy, wit, and, in typical Cibo Matto fashion, weirdness.  You see, the story is loosely based upon a ghost that has moved into the Hotel Valentine in New York.  It floats around high and gets high, it eats seedless grapes, it's weird, and it doesn't have to worry about guns, radiation, and marijuana being illegal.  It misses shopping.  But maybe not.What is remarkable is that the various professional reviews written about this album give it a barely above-average grade, yet all of them cite different songs as being the good ones.  One likes Lobby and MFN.  One thought that the Hotel Valentine song is clearly the best and also gave a nod to Housekeeping.  Another cited the classy D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  Everybody loves the beautiful Empty Pool and the gentle closing song, Checking Out.  Of course, the rock-type songs make everyone's list.  That's nine out of ten songs.  Somebody in the professional critic world loves nine out of the ten songs on this album.  This should tell you something.What it should tell you is this:  buy the album.  Put on the headphones, rest your head on the pillow, alter your brain, and welcome ecstasy."
AQ5Y9UO542ZHC,B00H8KCNDM,5.0,"In This Moment never disappoints and this DVD definitely shows how fantastic their live shows are. With all kinds of new theatrics, the band puts on a hell of a show. Not to mention, a special edition of their best-selling album, 'Blood' comes with it, which includes a cover of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer.' If you haven't heard of In This Moment, be sure to check them out. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"
A3QER9X66Q9YF6,B00H8RRDH6,2.0,"I love this band and always will...however, Whisky Tango Foxtrot happened with this album?  People can say all they want to try to dissect why this is still a good album; if it really was it wouldn't have to be dissected.  Truth be told 3 songs sound partially like the previous albums (thanks to Misha); but the rest of it is lost.  These guys are so talented that they could make a radio-friendly (lame) album and still pull it off...but this album was discombobulated.  I'm hoping that this is some sort of bland appetizer leading up to a delicious full album entree.  The Misha guitar riffs, and &#34;feed the ground&#34; are the only reasons to buy this album.  Otherwise wait until they actually put a full-length album together that doesn't bs you in to thinking you are buying an actual Periphery album.  Bring on Animals as Leaders...this was a major disappointment from such a talented group."
A1JY2UHLXV0P0,B00H8RRDH6,5.0,"So every member of the band got to do their own track, meaning they were in charge of the out come of it, and it is really cool.  It has a mix of everything that makes periphery awesome."
A30PATNMW180Z4,B00H8XF9I0,4.0,"As a Beatles completist collector, I bought this box set and am enjoying it for both its packaging and the music.At the same time, I know this isn&#8217;t a recreation of the music as originally released on Capitol Records.For anyone who owns both the 2009 stereo and mono CD box sets of what basically amounts to the original UK Parlophone releases, you really do have all the officially released recordings. If you chose to selectively buy the 2009 individual CD stereo releases, I make the assumption you are happy owning your favorite Beatles albums.If you are a Beatles collector, I hope you are happy with whatever products you have. There is much to collect in various formats as well as releases internationally.In the end, there is going to be some sort of disappointment. That doesn&#8217;t mean there is absolutely no value in whatever is released.Having said that, I believe the &#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;average&#8221; buyer of music would be happy with, at most, those 2009 box sets and the two volumes of &#8216;Capitol Albums&#8217;.As for the &#8216;The U.S. Albums&#8217; release, I&#8217;m glad all of the duophonic tracks have been replaced. I didn&#8217;t like duophonic back then (yes, I&#8217;m old), I don&#8217;t like it now.  I am disappointed that many U.S. oddities have gone missing (though some are there).I&#8217;m also disappointed that &#8216;Magical Mystery Tour&#8217; is missing, or at least, the individual oddities that are not present here. For me, there should have been a &#8216;Rarities&#8217; type disc included with this set.As far as any live stuff goes, I&#8217;m hoping for that reissue of the Hollywood Bowl album, but, also any additional material that may exist at Capitol and/or EMI (which is basically Universal now). A nice live package would be of interest to me.For me, I&#8217;ve had enough of the vitriol and rancor. It doesn&#8217;t serve any purpose (it really doesn&#8217;t). Having had correspondence and conversations over the years with various Beatle-related parties, I still find courtesy and professionalism can produce results (maybe not on anyone&#8217;s &#8220;set in stone&#8221; timetable)."
A2XLVPFARI7C8D,B00H8XF9I0,5.0,"I guess you can say I'm a &#34;Completist&#34; if that's even a word.  I do have all the U.K. re-masters in stereo and in mono.  I also have the Capitol series box set vol. 1, and I already have some of the U.S. released albums that were already released in Russia several years ago. I remember what the original vinyl versions sound like because I still have some left.  I grew up listening to the U.S. versions of the Beatles, so hearing these albums are more dear to my heart.  I was glad to hear that they were finally releasing all of the Capitol records in one box set. I've listened to most of the Cd's and I'm quite satisfied with the sound quality.  I prefer the Mono versions over the Stereo versions because they sound warmer to me.  The two covers of Yesterday and Today are cute, and the booklet / packaging I feel was nicely done.  My only complaint is that this collection is lacking Sgt. Peppers...  You could never have enough versions of Sgt. Peppers.  I am quite satisfied with this box set and would buy it all over again if I had to."
A3HLQTP00CM70,B00H8XF9I0,5.0,I have all the releases in all since 64 and love the sound improvement in this set. book explains all. great job Apple!
A1Q0HZQ8NY3MBU,B00H8XF9I0,1.0,"Monty Python's Eric Idle and his frequent collaborator, Neil Innes, put together a satirical take on the Beatles' story many years ago in which the Fabs became the \"Pre-fab Four\" and the name of the band was the Rutles. George Harrison thought enough of the project to put in a cameo. He and Eric were actually close friends, due, no doubt at least partly because Harrison never took the Beatles myth too seriously and could laugh at himself.In the spoof, Lennon's classic 1967 peace/love song was turned into \"All You Need is Cash.\"Enough said...ADDENDUM: In response to a reader who asked me what my point was, here it is, as written under the comment:My point is that the release of Beatle material with increasingly insignificant differences from the material already in the collections df the vast majority of obsessive boomers - myself included - is motivated by the desire to make lots of money off of people who still want to buy \"new\" Beatle music, 44 years after they ceased being a band. Each new set is packaged to appeal to the completist and results in an incredible amount of money being spent on material that the vast majority of those shelling out that cash already have. The truth is, for years, the Beatle establishment, the (surviving) Beatles themselves, and those marketing the British editions in their three released forms - first the 80s CDs, then the 2009 Stereo set and the 2009 Mono set, have made two things very clear over the years: the Original English albums were what the band intended their music to sound like and the Stereo mixes were mere afterthoughts until 1968 and the White album. It is disingenuous and greedy, therefore, to create a need for an inferior version of material after the better versions have been consumed.The bottom line, from my perspective is that after having purchased the 2009 stereo and mono box sets, I took the marketing people at their word and believed I had the Beatles' catalogue in the best and most faithful form commercially available. The American albums? Bought them as a kid and got the two boxes that preceded the 2009 boxes. As those really familiar with the Beatles' music have written herein, the later US album mixes aren't even the ones this set offers, so I see it as a crass bid for more investment in a band whose obsessive adherents are being manipulated. Are there exceptions? I'm sure there are. That's the big picture, however, as. I see it.SECOND ADDENDUM: I was told be Jeff, with whom I had a very fruitful discussion attached to the Comments for this review, that I should make my explanation of my review - the last thing I posted in the comment section - the review itself.  While I was glad Jeff found my explanation helpful, I'm thinking it may stand up better referring to the original, so I invite you to go through the comment section if what I've written isn't clear and/or helpful. And thanks again, Jeff!"
A1ZZTMY39IP857,B00H8XF9I0,5.0,"At last, the american records REVOLVER, RUBBER SOUL, BEATLES STORY!... A very very very good collection. Beatles 4 Ever!Thanks Apple"
A309B18FKBVCOA,B00H8XF9I0,2.0,Sgt. Pepper is NOT INCLUDED in this set and the US version is DISTINCTLY different from the English version!Magical Mystery Tour is NOT INCLUDED and WAS an American album NOT an English album!The two volumes of The White Album are NOT INCLUDEDAbby Road is NOT INCLUDED.Let It Be is NOT INCLUDEDDo they assume that those of us who buy this set already have the English records and therefore neither deserve nor require these classic Beatles albums... for $159? You must be kidding!I am seriously considering not opening these recordings and asking for my money back. As a US Beatles fan I guess I should be used to getting ripped off by Capitol records by this time.Angry and disappointed.
ALD1CRUBY1365,B00H8XF9I0,1.0,"Yes yes, I know that a lot of what Lyndon Johnson called &#34;Mah fella Amuricans&#34; missed &#34;Yesterday and Today&#34; and &#34;Early Beatles&#34; and other such LP titles that were trimmed down from the original 14-song Brit Parlophone releases, and the first CD releases WERE those Parlophone albums left intact. But all you had to do to get the rarities left dangling in the breeze like &#34;You Know My Name&#34; and the German versions of &#34;She Loves You&#34; and &#34;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&#34; was to get both US edition &#34;Past Masters&#34; discs. But even if the Company CAN claim that this set is for the Beatlemaniac who wore out a lot of his LPs and never did get the Parlophone CDs, you have to remember that the completist zealot buys without thinking. And a &#34;real rock'n'roller&#34;--be he artist or listener--is taught NEVER to think. So having already grabbed those resurrected Parlophone discs back in the '80s while I boxed all my LPs up as 60s memorabilia, I'm not about to spend a yard-and-a-half on music I already own. Not even if the point IS the &#34;50th Anniversary&#34;."
A291X75UCH6KN8,B00H8XF9I0,1.0,What amazes me is how they bemoan a project that was an obvious rip-off to begin with because the sound isn't lousy enough!  Hilarious.  I'm glad people hate this set....It's a travesty.  It really doesn't matter though.  Capitol will earn a huge windfall taking advantage of people dumb enough to re-buy something they already have. Anyone who buys &#34;The U.S. Albums&#34; deserves them.
A31X3S3FY1FQTE,B00H8XF9I0,1.0,"Luckily, we got the originals recordings in Australia. How stupid and high-handed to change the track order, add reverb, reduce the bass and make different artwork.Tape hiss and fake stereo. Not interested."
A3NTJ01Y4QLUP0,B00H8XF9I0,5.0,"February of 1964 was an historic milestone in the history of popular music. The British quartet known as The Beatles arrived here in America in New York to make their American television debut on the Ed Sullivan Show which aired on the CBS network. More than 73 million viewers tuned in that night, and everything changed after that. The group was a refreshing and new style of music, the likes of which we had never heard or seen before. Capitol records pushed the envelope in a huge way, and the end results are remarkable, to say the least. To recognize this historic milestone, Capitol and Apple have recently released a brilliant new 13-disc CD boxed set titled &#34;The U.S. Albums&#34;, Housed in a beautifully constructed box, it features a classic full-color photograph of the boys positioned in front of the stars and stripes; a rather appropriate image to help solidify this release. 13 unique American albums are included here in this set. They are as follows ;&#34;Meet The Beatles!&#34;&#34;The Beatles' Second Album&#34;&#34;A Hard Day's Night (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)&#34;&#34;Something New&#34;&#34;The Beatles' Story&#34;&#34;Beatles '65&#34;&#34;The Early Beatles&#34;&#34;Beatles VI&#34;&#34;Help! (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)&#34;&#34;Rubber Soul&#34;&#34;Yesterday And Today&#34;&#34;Revolver&#34;&#34;Hey Jude&#34;All CDs are presented in miniature replica LP packaging, including reproductions of the original album inner sleeves. Both &#34;The Beatles' Story&#34; and &#34;Hey Jude&#34; are available in Stereo only, while the remaining CDs are issued in both Mono AND Stereo mixes on each disc. Each album features the same track listings that were made available on the originally-released vinyl LPs back in the 60's, plus the &#34;Hey Jude&#34; album from 1970. It should be noted that 12 of these CDs are also available for purchase individually. However, &#34;The Beatles' Story&#34; CD is only included in this boxed set, and not as a seperate title on its own. So, the only way to hear this CD is to acquire this set. The collection also includes a 64-page booklet that details the historical significance of these timeless albums. It features an annotated essay from Bill Flanagan; unique and rare materials pertaining to the albums shown in either full-color or original black-and-white images; a section on production notes that explains the restoration and mastering process that was used to create the CDs; and a complete track listing for each disc.This is a great way to help celebrate 50 years of Beatlemania in America. &#34;The U.S. Albums&#34; is a wonderful addition to the Beatles CD catalog, and a fine way to relive the memories of the music that changed the youth of America."
A2IF0YQKW4PS1T,B00H8XF9I0,5.0,ONE OF THE BEST BEATLES BOX SETS EVER. EVERY CD IS GREAT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MONO AND STEREO IS AMAZING
A3JDQJMWDDS9Q2,B00HAA8URS,3.0,I was. Ot impressed with her cd as I thought I'd be.  Meaning it was not what I'd expected...maybe an age thing.
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00HAA8URS,1.0,"I've been eagerly awaiting the follow up to Beyonce's 2011 album4Than a week ago I learned from my friend Henrique that she'd released the album on Itunes with no promotion,no pre announcements with many major record distributes refusing to carry the CD version of this album. She also released music videos to all of the albums 14 songs-which are included with the CD version I was lucky enough to find at my local record store Bull Moose. This is a very pro-MP3 and anti establishment move on Beyonce's part,and could still spell an alternate and more humanistic way to present new music to the public. Musical activism aside,my devotion to well rounded critical assessment is important. In that spirit I must say that this album is extremely musically disappointing. While showing unique musical flavors in the past on songs such as \"Naughty Girl\",\"Get Me Bodied\",\"Single Ladies\" and \"Love On Top\",this album showcases mostly dry and very static contemporary hip-hop style numbers with a lot of flashy electronic effects with little to no melody at all.Not only that but Beyonce' is presenting herself as a rather joyless musical prostitute here-singing sexually explicit,profane and sometimes even self hating lyrics in a flat and bored tone of voice. Musically the only things that really stand above this to any degree are the stripped down naked/boogie funk styled \"Blow\" and the Chicago style orchestral soul balled of \"Superpower\" with Frank Ocean. \"Heaven\" is a nice piano driven ballad too-all three songs contain more melody and song craft than most of the album. And really? It isn't much. It really confuses me to hear some of these reviewers here describe this album as a beautiful and sexy musical experience. Perhaps its a massive generational difference here. But to these ears? This is by far the weakest and least musically satisfying album Beyonce' has made thus far. One wonders if her decision to release it as she did was more out of mild embarrassment as to its contents than as a form of activism against the troubles within the music industry. There are a few songs here that are serviceable. But overall it sounds like a collection of outtakes from 2004 that never made the cut for her first two albums-because they sounded too much like some of her weaker contemporaries. Hats off to Beyonce for her method of releasing this album. But not at all pleased with the musical contents."
ACIM7R8WLS7M,B00HAA8URS,1.0,"This album is awful. I don't know what is going on with her or what she was thinking, but the lyrics are awful, the sound of her voice is not at all pleasant. If I had been able to give this album a listen I would not have spent a dime on it. Waste of money on something that is anything but enjoyable. Disappointed!"
A1VH1G8XO4J70,B00HAA8URS,5.0,"It's a great album. The videos was a great addition to the album. I enjoy the tunes, I'm pleased with my purchase"
A15105Y7IL1FO9,B00HAA8URS,4.0,"First off let me say that I am 30+ year old heterosexual man and I love Beyonce. I don't always agree with her songs. And every song is not great. But she is an excellent performer and I have all her albums in my collection. Like most people, I was surprised that Beyonce took the Jay-Z route and dropped an album with no promo or lead single. I downloaded the album that day (Sorry Amazon) and was caught off guard by some of the lyrics. I did not expect this type of Beyonce. I was used to men bashing and women empowerment, not dripping wet waterfalls.Gone are the women's movement, kicking men in the nuts, break up hurt songs. This album is sexually seductive, creatively closer to Christina Aguilera \"Stripped\" (without the slutty promotion). Standouts on this album include \"No Angel\", \"Flawless\", \"Partition\" and \"Drunk In Love\" with hubby Jay-Z. \"Rocket\" is my favorite song on this album. The slow groove seduction on this song with lyrics about her splashing waterfalls is the most underrated song on the album. But not every song here is about seduction. \"Pretty Hurts\" is a song about how hard it is for women to maintain their beauty. And \"Heaven\" is a sad song that will be sung at every funeral in 2014. Other solid songs are \"Blow\", \"XO\" and the Drake assisted \"Mine\". There are not too many low points on this album. The only one is \"Haunted\" which feels weird and misplaced.I guess there comes a point where all female artists need a change. Madonna, Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey, and others have made the change from just getting by on talent to showing more of their sexual side. I like the change in direction that Beyonce has taken for this album. In some ways this album reminds me of Usher's \"Here I Stand\" album. Most of the album works. My problem is other than a couple raunchy songs, this is a typical Beyonce album. A couple pop songs, a song about her baby girl Blue Ivy. There is no real direction or theme, just a bunch of songs thrown together to make an unfinished album. I would have loved if she stayed raunchy the entire time. Instead she choose to be five different people on this album; Beyonce, B-girl, mother, wife, and mistress. However, no matter who she is, Beyonce has once again set the bar again for female artist.  B+"
A3NNZW2PK7V2BR,B00HAA8URS,5.0,"Best album by Beyonce to date!!! Love the sound to this album, and the concept.  Actually giving you visuals to the songs. &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;"
A3C93P07N0LREB,B00HAA8URS,4.0,"I mean, she's clearly come out of her shell. But the content is overly racy. I can't listen to it too much, its too sexual and I am not married, trying to stay abstinent. Listening to her music does not help my case. Very very very catchy, and great melodies. My favorite is Superpower and Jealous. Beautiful songs, while the others are very party, club and sex oriented. Call me square, but I listen to music for more than that vibe."
A2UCZ2DXKCIDYK,B00HAA8URS,5.0,"Why did I review the album? I didn't even know about it until my sister sent me an email about it. I promised her I would review itDid I like it? YesWill I listen again? I already have... about 30 timesI don't expect any of you to like it as much as I did, but at least I could explain why I loved it. For years I stayed away from Beyonc&eacute; because I felt like she wasted her talent with a lot of songs that didn't showcase her voice, but instead relied on catchiness and hype that would ensure radio play (but I never listened to her albums so I'm not quite being fair). This one finally gave me what I have been begging for. Every time I listen I notice something new and find something else to like. I gave out 5 stars like candy. I haven't given out this many 5star ratings since Macklemore's The Heist and The Fray's How to Save a Life. It's an album that explores her vision and what is important to her. That's important because the best music is created (usually) when an artist is emotionally tied to the work. If this is an indication of Beyonc&eacute;'s capabilities when no one is screaming in her ear to make a certain type of song, I'll support her because she's proven that she won't disappoint. The album nailed her range as a vocalist, while toying with beats to keep each song fresh and original. The topics covered on the album are diverse. One song details her love for Jay, while another forces her to confront her own insecurities, to another that cites the hypocrisy in the world, and even includes a redefining of death. The albums mission is vast but it handles them masterfully. Beyonc&eacute;'s Beyonc&eacute; is my favorite album of 2013.My Favs3. Blue2. Rocket1. HeavenOverall Rating: 93  with a Classic recommendationA track by track review is available at Rhythmandreviews.blogspot"
A1HC63B19D9Y61,B00HAA8URS,5.0,"I didn't purchase this on amazon, but I see posts where it says the info on the cd dvd is wrong, in this edition it does bring 17 beautifully made videos and 14 audio songs, my perception is that she really worked hard and evolved on this cd, a lot of Rihannna influence, but for me it is a good thing... For the ones like me who like some nice art on a cd, this one has a gorgeous one, thick booklet with photos (No lyrics). BTW, Beyonc&eacute; looks spectacularly beautiful in all videos. I strongly recommend this cd."
A3NATBTZI5DWD3,B00HAA8URS,5.0,"What can I say about this incredibly talented woman I mean it's Beyonce she is breathtaking. I enjoyed this album completely my favorites are Partition, Mine and Drunk In Love. The videos are pure enjoyment. Beyonce is one of today's most talented artist I am so glad she  has her own style of music which I feel most others lack, which is one of the reasons why I appreciate her even more."
AH8FW3A2M52ST,B00HACNQC0,5.0,"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviews that are saying that \"Motivational Jumpsuit\" is Guided By Voices best LP since this same lineup recorded the classic \"Under The Bushes\". In my mind, it blows everything from the \"Isolation Drills\" era so to speak right out of the water. And it achieves this by about song 5!There are just so many good songs from the get-go. And then more good songs after the first listen, second listen etc. This is like those albums from the golden era. You'll always want to listen to it in order from 1-20 without skips or stops. I can't think of an album they've made since possibly even \"Bee Thousand\" that has this many highlights: \"Vote For Me Dummy\", \"Go Without Packing\", \"Record Level Love\", \"Littlest League Possible\", \"Writer's Bloc\", \"Until Next Time\", \"Planet Score\" (probably my favorite song), \"Difficult Outburst & Breakthrough\", \"Shine\", \"Save The Company\", \"Jupiter Spin\", \"Evangeline Dandelion\" and \"Alex and The Omegas\" can count, in my mind, among some of the best tracks this revered lineup has ever recorded. Even some of the more minute long Robert Pollard naval-gazing ditties, or whatever the hipster haters call them these days, do not go unnecessary here. Heck, even Bob's continued King Crimson fetish, seen here with \"I Am Columbus\" fits in like a glove on this album.Overall, its a must for anyone who's a fan, was once a fan, or ever thought about being a fan of this band.9/10"
AVCRD98TH48RN,B00HAH7H5W,5.0,"A few years back the lead singer of Behemoth was diagnosed with leukemia.  He fought long and hard to recover, and now one can not help but think his big picture perspective must have changed, or at least the foundations were roughly shaken.  For what has been created with &#34;The Satanist&#34; is remarkable, completely stunning to this reviewer.  I never considered Behemoth to be anything more than a solid Blackened Death Metal band, with occasional spurts of singular greatness, until now.  The songwriting on this release is emotionally gripping, the production has static depth of field and epic ambience, and the performances are energetic and purposeful.  Lead singer and chief songwriter Nergal has never sounded better, or more lyrically decipherable, than on this album.  He has something to growl and rasp about this time, and wants everyone who hears to grasp his intentions.  Of course, this precise sense of direction has rubbed off on the other musicians and the final result is an album that will be spoken about for years to come, a monument for the Death Metal ages, intelligent and visceral, expertly crafted and performed with madness and grace."
A3QMKFZ0DK0JFB,B00HAH7H5W,5.0,"When Nergal said that this new music was influenced by industrial I started thinking TOO EXTREME!!!...HA! Death metal fans will understand that joke. But this isn't a bushwhack. They have returned from a several years hiatus to gift us with this masterpiece of concise riffing, and great production. I'm not a die hard fan of this band. Out of their entire discography I've only liked 4 of their albums including this one, but when they do one right it is done really well. Good job guys!!!"
AXJCEPVI2O2KX,B00HAH7H5W,5.0,The best metal act on planet earth.
A8OTE7AH3CIWD,B00HAH7H5W,5.0,"Many years ago, my band was fortunate enough to open for these guys on the road in NJ.  I became a fan after being treated so well by this Polish powerhouse.  They were the best band of the night (by far) and it seems this may have actually been their first US tour, ever.Fast forward through years of continuing to support this awesome band, worrying that I would never get to hear a new album after Nergal was diagnosed with cancer.  Here I am today, now getting to review the new album I worried would never come.Perhaps I am biased in that my views of this album may be colored by my anticipation after 4 years of wait?  Perhaps my previous experience getting to meet this band and being treated well have also influenced my view?  No matter the influences, I will boldly state that this is not only the best album Behemoth has ever written, but also a musical and artistic triumph for all genres of music.So, where do I start?  Well, I won't give a play by play of the album [as you must do that, yourself], but I will say that any that are worried that the best song is &#34;Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel&#34;, will be pleasantly surprised as you are treated to, not just one, but many powerful, jaw dropping musical moments.  There are at least 5 songs that are every bit as good as the opener.  &#34;Blow your Trumpets...&#34; is merely the beginning of which turns into a dark musical journey through the mind of Nergal.  Yes, this album actually strongly expresses a viewpoint that seems to truly resonate clearly.  No, it is not just mindless evil, as some may attest.  This is intelligent, bold, expressive, majestic, sinister blackened death metal.  I feel this sums it up well.I will be bold and call this a masterpiece, because I truly feel that it is.  It is rare to hear any album that takes the listener on such a journey, let alone one in this genre.  Behemoth have done that, and I applaud them loudly for it.  Not only that, but the journey is also wholly unique.  From the thunderous &#34;Blow Your Trumpets...&#34; to the epic title track and ending with the truly artistic &#34;O Father O Satan O Sun!&#34;, this album is jaw-dropping in its delivery, and is never predictable.  Yes, this is definitely Behemoth, but more expressive, emotional, and darker than ever before.  This is their pinnacle release, and yes, I also loved every single one of their previous releases.  No band-wagon jumping here, folks!So, should you buy this album?  If you do not, you will be at a loss.  Perhaps, the extreme religious message will take you aback?  I suggest a very open mind when listening to this, if their views offend you.  Remember, we are listening to someone's views and going on a journey, but that does not mean the listener has to embrace those views.  Regardless of what your views are, this CD will both frighten and excite you, all at the same time.  This is one of the greatest releases I have heard in a long time and it will continue to get repeated plays in my car, months from now.  Do yourselves a favor and buy this one with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed.  Thank you Behemoth and thank you Nergal for being an awesome person, treating me well when you didn't have to, and for continuing the fight for what you believe in.  Apo pantos kakodaimonos!!!"
A3QTSCTRZF3VGY,B00HAH7H5W,5.0,"Nergal aka Adam Darsky, leader of Poland's Behemoth, the most brutal band from that country, and probably most others, certainly had his trials and tribulations between \"Evangelion\", the previous beast of an album, that until now was the band's high water mark and \"Satanist\".  His well publicized bout with leukemia and very fortunate recovery from it thanks to a successful bone marrow transplant and the support of metal fans worldwide has seemingly injected new vigor and vitality into him.\"Satanist\" is one of the best metal albums in a long time and will give serious competition to other releases due this year.  Behemoth tread a very thin line between black and death metal, and this time seem to veer ever so slightly toward death, which means a slightly tighter sound and some actual hooks here and there, plus some spoken word bits, in Polish and English and even keyboards.  But don't mistake this for wimping out.  Nergal has streamlined his attack, smoothed out a few rough edges and created an album other bands in the genre will be quick to imitate because it's raised the bar for that type of metal far over most bands' heads.  Immortal is supposedly doing a new album this year, and they are likely one of the few to be capable of being in the same company.Musically, there are more distinct guitar lines, and the buzz saw approach that defines black metal has been refined into a well produced masterpiece where all the parts are audible and as stated before, a few hooks here and there help hold the proceedings together without compromising the Behemoth sound.It's that change that makes \"Satanist\" so good.  While I like \"Evangelion\" and \"Demigod\" as well as anything, those albums could be difficult to listen to if you weren't in the mood for pure unrelenting bombast.  Behemoth needed an overhaul, and they succeeded.Not that I'm down on older releases.  Behemoth are great, always have been.  It's just cool to see Nergal, still under political pressure from the Polish church authorities, who have no problem kicking people when they're down, make an album of defiance that because it's more listenable makes it even more dangerous and potent.  We salute you, fellows.  Your fight for freedom of speech through your music is admirable in the extreme and one hopes this album scares the living s*** out of the authorities."

A1R7MA77TLD3C9,B00HB3AP9A,5.0,"Best Sun Kil Moon album to date!  It's the most aggressive too!  The lyrics make the album, he has a lot to say on this one.  Nice and long as well 62min.  On one track it's almost as if he's rapping, weird for Mark. The lyrics are sad, funny, macabre and honest!  Listened to this album 7 times the first day I got it. Any fan of Sun Kil Moon should love this one!  Essential."
AW7HE63KV1W1G,B00HCLNU5C,2.0,"I am a big fan of Brian Culbertson and he made a lot more albums that I like than ones that I don't like. This one sounded like a fantastic proposition: to re-make his very first album, but instead of playing all instruments himself (mostly synths), he now hired great musicians and used real instruments. The Sound Quality is indeed much better, with wider range and better timbre/richer colours, but I feel that somehow the magic of the first album is left behind. The music just feels a bit uninspired and matter-of-fact. Listening to the first and latest albums side by side, I can't help but conclude that while the idea was great, the endresult doesn't move me."
A39QBJOUGRBWYU,B00HCLNU5C,5.0,I really love this CD. Smooth as silk. I am afraid of playing it too much LOL. I love how Brian give us something a little different on all of his CD's. A must have.
APRHZYE8U0IGM,B00HCLNU5C,5.0,"&#34;Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out. Welcome back to that same old place that you laughed about.Well the names have all changed since you hung around, But those dreams have remained and they're turned around.&#34;Brian Culbertson now joins Brian Simpson as the only 2 smooth jazz artist that I am aware of that did not allow a digital format of their music when initially released. And as also in the case of Brian Simpson, Brian Culbertson's Another Long Night Out did not suffer any harm in this because This. Is. Just. Spectacular. I titled this review &#34;Welcome home&#34; because this introduced me, as well as to many others, into B.C.'s thoughts into making this project, revisiting the roots he put down 20 years ago and to once again create a true, smooth jazz album. 20 years. That within itself is such an amazing feat because to do be in any profession and then to do it 20 years, it should and would make anyone, pause, and reflect and it is done so magnificently here. Other than the music, the decision to not release ALNO digitally really helped in the sense that, the message Brian lays out about his experience making the first Long Night Out would simply be missed without the purchase of the CD. I am glad this was done because it truly enriches what you will hear and further cements his legacy as one the best ever, no matter the genre. In particular, if you have not seen the vlog he kept while making ANLO, please go and view it on YouTube. What REALLY hit me when I started listening to Fullerton Ave., was when Chuck Loeb started playing and while there were severaltakes, you will hear in all its passion that funk coming out and visualize Chuck Loeb bending and seemingly straining to get those notes out of that guitar! MAN!!!!! As always, you, me, and he(whatcha gon do, baby?) will have our favorite cuts, but this is masterful and masterfully done. Turn your day into Night, and make it Long!"

A38DN9VTAHC088,B00HDG4WNA,5.0,I am a big fan of Rhonda and her music and she covers all of the bases from country to Bluegrass and all of it well. This is just good toe tapping feel good music that ost everyone can appreciate.
A2C3KQE07LYRNW,B00HDG4WNA,4.0,"I was a little disappointed with the recording mix, as her voice doesn't seem quite as angelic as on other recordings. Still, I am glad I added this to my growing collection of progressive bluegrass music. The backing musicians are excellent and on the one song with Willie Nelson, his distinctive guitar sounds loud and clear. I really liked her version of Beneath Still Waters. I was pleasurably surprised to hear her on Willie's Roadhouse on XM introducing this album over the weekend. As new fan of her music I didn't realize how new the album was."
A1KOJ03D6S5JZX,B00HDG4WNA,5.0,There are two cd's in this package. One true bluegrass and one aimed towards the traditional country music. They are both excellent.I like Rhonda Vincent almost as much as Alison Kraus & Union Station. It is hard for me to pick a favorite.
A395RV305GU5TD,B00HDZTYKC,5.0,"Martina has such a great voice,not to mention that she is nice,classy,reverent,decent,and beautiful inside and out.She takes these songs and gives us some nice songs that once you hear them you want to play them again and again.every song on it is my favorite one until I hear the next one.She just hit some home runs.Very well recorded and done Martina style with a bit if the high pitches toned down,which makes this cd even better.This cd and Martina will stand the test of time,just as the songs on this cd have.If you love and appreciate Martina and the old R&B SONGS,THEN THIS IS YOUR CD."
AQZGUBM6I5PM5,B00HDZTYKC,5.0,"Wow!  what a great CD!  Wonderful covers of rock and roll, Rhythm and Blues, and Pop.  But the big surprise is that it comes from the best ol' Belle of Country Music supported by a production center in Nashville, but with collaborating inputs from all over the country.  Here we see a Cultural Evolution which we should all turn to for a moment and appreciate.  The way it started was at first the South was able to captivate the North... and the East and the West... with 'crossover' Hits -- country songs that everybody liked.  But then, well, Popular Music Fans began to find that the ONLY songs they ever liked anymore were 'crossover'... That Rock and Roll had declined into Bedroom Productions of over processed electronic noise, scraped into an emotional monotony by Auto Tuning features... and that the old diehard Slogan of &#34;rock and roll will never die&#34; seems to be the most fitting epitaph to put on its tombstone.  And then there are the Black Americans, who had once been known for their musicality, but after 40 years of supposing Sports was their NEW salvation, well, they traded their guitars, pianos and saxophones for dribbling basketballs, and, as we could scientifically well predict, their 'natural' musical abilities soon faded away, and now we have a generation of people of color who don't get Motown... simply can't comprehend its elegant but powerful complexity... but now express themselves 'musically' with spitting sounds, rhymed profanities, indeed, rhymed anything, and, like rock n roll along with them, with Electronic Non-Music encasing their idiotic Fools' Splendor of childish noise.  So, with the Traditional Sources of the Most Popular Music in America all dried up, where is everybody to go?  Go South, my friends, Go South.Now, don't get me wrong.  Southern Music has its problems.  the Record Labels and Producers are fixated on New Acts, and are too quick to abandon Artists who had hardly yet gotten their feet wet in the business.  and the Older Artists are almost completely abandoned... given the consolation of a Country Music Life Time Contribution Award, but nobody will kick a job their way.  So, yes, the Southern Music Industry is probably even more Predatory than Pop or Motown ever had been... maybe it is the Slave Driver heritage still going strong Down There.  But in everything there is a Blessing and a Curse, as I can't wait until somebody Down There finally figures out that Taylor Swift has had an easy ride too long... maybe getting kicked out of the Fast Lane will encourage her to finally dig a little deeper... and to frigging Grow Up!But, with all the faults of Country Music, still, to their Everlasting credit, they have preserved the Last Bastion of True Popular Music in America... maybe the World.  None of that Electronic Canned Crap.  They still pick up the phone Down There and call in the best musicians they know... and in Nashville you can bet that the fifth best guitar player would be the best guitar player anywhere else.  And now that pop music everywhere else in the Country is getting away from Real Musicians, Nashville (and slimeball Los Vegas) have turned into the refugee centers for abandoned and jobless Horn, String and Keyboard Players from everywhere else.  Nashville now has the best Musicians from all over the World, and with this New Album -- &#34;Everlasting&#34; by Martina McBride, we can see that they are not afraid to use them.My only problem with this CD... and it is the most desirable a problem one could ever wish to have -- is of having to choose between the Better or the Best.  Some of Martina McBride's covers are already in my 700 song Favorite Song Playlist, that I use for my musical instrument practices.  I will patch her in and play her covers along with my other covers (or Originals), and see which I prefer.  there is one Song that is already IN, and that is &#34;My Babe&#34; an old Rhythm and Blues song, so apparently simple, that nobody recently had thought to cover it, but, WOW, did it need covering,  with a good Lead Voice, such as Martina's, and all those world class production values we now have in Nashville.... I now have 701 favorite songs in my favorite song playlist.Anyway, with Martina McBride grabbing all of these Pop and R&B; Songs and taking them down to her Fan Base way down deep in Dixie, we may hope that the 'Crossover' flow has somehow been prodded to now go the other direction as well... that while befor the North has been enjoying the South, that now the South may enjoy the North... even if it is just a Historical Compilation... a Collection of what the North was capable of before its unfortunate Cultural Decline.and yet I see a hints in some of the reviews that Southerners are complaining that Martina has abandoned Country Music.  Well, those idiot Red Necks are too stupid to recognize that they had just finally Won the War (or, at least the Re-Match), and if they had any sense they would be dancing for joy in the streets.  and, besides, wouldn't some Country Songs REALLY benefit from a Saxophone or two?  Message to the South -- You WON!  Enjoy the Fruits of your Spoils.  Grab up those Horns and Keyboard Players.  Your Music will only get Richer and Better.Oh ... Now I am wondering whether our Friends down South are wondering how to make a Saxophone sound more 'Twangy'.  Yes, I concede that the South has won, but with my Yankee sympathies, and memories when Popular Music in the North was decidedly BETTER, I can't help to be sad that the South had finally Won... not be any particular valor or talent on their own part, but simply from default... that the North had suddenly just laid down and died without a fight.anyway, Miss McBride's CD is great, and maybe it is a token, that the Record Labels and Producers down South rightly recognize that the Fate of Popular Music, not just Country, is in their hands now, and that they should do it justice -- the World depend upon them... not just their old customers who, even just 30 years ago, were not enough to push a song into the National Pop Top 40.... their own 'Small' Market had to create a separate category  -- the Country and Western Chart -- just so that they could make a blip anywhere.  Any Market that Small should remember not to be too Proud.Oh, special kudos for Martina McBride's Production Team.  In the CD Envelope, in Miss McBride's Thank You Notes, she mentions a Monica Lynch for her help in selecting the Songs for the CD.  Apparently the selection process had gone on for months and had involved many a late night phone call.  and Martina speaks of a new Freedom she had found (probably to get beyond Pure Country and to appreciate Good Music anywhere it is to be found).  anyway, apparently a lot of struggle and thought (and career Risk) had gone into this CD.It is a Cultural Milestone.  Buy it.  It is important."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00HDZTYKC,3.0,"martina mcbride can sing and has feeling,however her range and overall feel just doesn't have the necessary depth to take these songs next level. its very professional sounding,however when you are covering classic R&B the key word is grit and hitting the ribs like spare ribs on a bar b que pit and turned over with dripping juice and flavor and this album while not all milk toasty, just comes up short from leaving that kinda feeling. if Mcbride had a bonnie raitt type of rawness in her tone then this might be a career changing move which would usher her into a new vibe all together. this is cool and yet so much more could have been on point if the full goods had been met. i like her voice and style."
A3F7RI564LMN1P,B00HEVGK66,4.0,"While as a classic lineup WA fan , I miss Ted and Martin (and even Laurie), I accept the fact that Powell is &#34;the man&#34; right now and he's done a pretty darn good job of keeping the classic WA sound at the fore. This album is no exception. The first track &#34;Take it Back&#34; has some interesting and catchy chord changes that remind one of why Powell was so important to the bands sound. &#34;Deep Blues&#34; is a solid number and &#34;Being One&#34; and &#34;Way down South&#34; are very listenable numbers as well. &#34;Tally Ho&#34; and &#34;Blue Horizon&#34; hit the mark for (if nothing else) being solid Andy Powell tracks. &#34;All There is to Say&#34; finishes off the album nicely. &#34;American Century&#34; to me is utter filler, but to each their own, I guess. AP really has done a pretty good job of making quality WA flavored stuff since the more classic lineups ceased. &#34;Clan Destiny&#34; is also a pretty solid album, and &#34;Live in Geneva&#34; is utterly smoking, if you haven't heard a live album from a newer version of WA."
AE9KRNXERZWTY,B00HEXX0CG,5.0,Belinda - how I love thee- with the Go-Go's or not!  Sun is a fantastic new song  that shows an interesting new direction I hope belinda will follow up on!  The sound on the tracks is great too- imports always sound great!
A19KWNP6BANHCD,B00HF7YQHY,5.0,"Outstanding collection of songs, extraordinary musicality...definitely something for everyone here!  Superb from the first listen--which is a rarity these days.  Let's hope that country music will stop ignorning her and play real 'country' music instead of that crap they are peddling on the airways today.  Let's hear more Dolly, George Strait, Alan Jackson, etc.Way to go, Dolly!!!"
AQZGUBM6I5PM5,B00HF7YQHY,3.0,"Dolly Parton is great.  That Magical Voice.  That more than Magical Personality... hey, most people don't remember this, but in the early seventies Dolly sort of toured America, doing Local Market mid-day talk shows, coming on a week at a time to be visiting co-host, well, she would cozy up to those small studio audiences with that 'you-'ll' accent of hers and they'd eat it up -- everybody loved her and she was still just a nobody back then... but when she finally got a hit, well it was easy for her to go National because people, well, they forgot where they knew her from, but they already knew her. I saw her myself on the Philadelphia Mike Douglas Show.  So, yes, I know the Dolly Parton Magic.  and, yes, she is a great Song Writer, but you have to ask yourself What makes a Great Song Writer.  Really, any career with more than just two or three solid hits is amazing.  Hits are really few and far between.  Now some of her old hits, well, they had a Quality -- almost Organic, like they grew out of some perfect Logos Archetypes of Southern Musical Concept.  And, clever too -- take &#34;9 to 5&#34; ... she woke up and poured herself a cup of 'ambition' -- how cute was that!?  But most of what's here on Blue Smoke sounds, well, a bit strained and perhaps unfinished.  &#34;You Can't Make Old Friends&#34; is good, but I already have it from the superb Kenny Rogers CD.  The cover of the Bob Dylan song &#34;Don't Think Twice&#34;, well, that is probably the stand out song here.  she not only blew the dust off the Bob Dylan version, but added a real nice production concept -- buy it and you'll hear it... when I first heard it, well, it came out of the Blue, so to speak, and I didn't know what I had just heard.. she was layering the lyrics, creating a new break in the song.  Oh, and that song, Don't Think Twice, is a perfect Southern Song.  You know, there was some controversy about that song.  What I heard was that some student from Columbia University was doing a Doctoral Treatise on Appalachian Folk Music, and then one day he hears one of his collected songs on the radio -- Bob Dylan's &#34;Don't Think Twice&#34;.  Hmmmm, wonder what happened to that kid -- the Student, not Dylan... we know he went about as far as he could go and then bottomed out.  Oh, speaking about old songs.... Number 9 on Dolly's CD is a song called &#34;If I Had Wings&#34;, well, as soon as it starts you KNOW you already heard the song, but then it bends off a bit and then you realize that the song is REALLY derivative of another song, and it might take you a minute or two to guess what song is being re-packaged -- &#34;Wayfaring Stranger&#34;, an old Folk song from the 19th Century.... it was one of Burl Ives' signature songs and Emmy Lou Harris, who has worked a lot with Dolly, had covered it.  But &#34;If I Had Wings&#34; does too much to twist and turn the song away from the classic organic flow of the original &#34;Wayfaring Stranger&#34;.  And as I said before, it sounds a bit strained and a bit unfinished.  Anyway, no Hits here, but Production Quality is high and you need to listen to something in the car, so I gave it a 3 out of 5."
AWJU47R97K13O,B00HF7YQHY,4.0,"What can be said about Dolly that hasn't already been said? The wigs, the boobs, the Voice-still all in great working order at age 68. This new cd shows the many sides of Dolly the singer.  Pop, bluegrass,gospel and country songs are all here and well perfomed. Standouts for me are:From Here to the Moon and Back - a duet with Willie NelsonBanks of the Ohio - a superb bluegrass story songDon't Think Twice - a classic Bob Dylan coverBlue Smoke - an out and out Country barn burnerI am not so pleased with the cover of Bon Jovi's Lay Your Hands on Me which is given a gospel treatment here. That song and another cut on the cd, Try, are too schmaltzy and overdone emotionally. But that positive message is a big part of Dolly's persona. Overall, a valiant effort from a real entertainment legend.This has to be ordered as an import because it will not be released until May in the States. Australia and New Zealand got the initial release because of Dolly's January dates there."
A15I1RHKAYX622,B00HF7YQHY,5.0,"I was lucky enough to obtain this 12 track CD about a month before it was released here in the UK. I believe it to be one of her most uplifting and inspiring best. The title track really choo choos along (listen and it will make sense) followed by self-penned tracks of differing tempos, plus the odd song written by somebody else. Whilst on a BBC radio show recently entitled `Dolly`s Jukebox` she said that the track recorded with Kenny Rogers, &#34;You Can`t Make Old Friends&#34; was recorded almost 30 years to the day when they made &#34;Islands In The Stream&#34; ....30 years, really !!!Released as a single, to coincide with her UK tour is &#34;Home&#34;. She also duets with Willie Nelson on &#34;From Here To The Moon And Back&#34;. The UK release also includes a `Best Of...` CD as a bonus.If you are a fan of the great LADY you will enjoy this, almost as much as me!"
APRJB8DFOOP6K,B00HF7YQHY,5.0,She still has a great voice and good songs
A25FFVHS1CF9UT,B00HF95OMI,5.0,The very first time I heard Celtic Woman was on the Public Broadcasting Channel and I enjoyed listening to their music so much that I purchased 2 of their CDs and Emerald: Musical Gems is right of there on top with the other CDs I have of their music.
A32ZOMCLX1I1U5,B00HFDKTC4,5.0,"There's little that I can add to the reviews already posted here. Since I used to see to JoAnn Falletta conduct the San Francisco Women's Philharmonic clear back in the 1980's, it doesn't surprise me in the least that she brings a tremendous amount of energy and dedication to Gliere's unruly behemoth of a symphony. Make no mistake, this is a five star performance of what is really a four star work. But what is truly ear-opening here, is just what an outstanding job the Buffallo Philharmonic does in sustaining the tension across the full 80 minutes - never does their concentration lag.While dubbed a symphony, Gliere's third is more a programmatic work than a symphony in any traditional sense. As a Mahler enthusiast, perhaps that's what attracts me most to the work. But this is also a piece that can feel like 80 minutes of sameness. That's why slower performances simply don't work, regardless of what the composer's initial tempo thoughts might have been. In other words, too much of a good thing can, indeed, be just that: too much. Falletta's faster tempi, combined with stellar orchestral execution, elevates &#34;Ilya Muromets&#34; to a plain that it is simply hasn't enjoyed prior to now. Little more needs to be said in terms of the performance. What does the piece sound like?  .  .  .For Gliere's third, think of a cross between Borodin on the one hand, and the highly chromatic (half-step harmonies) and over heated, late romantic idiom of Scriabin, Szymanowki and Suk on the other hand. His music is generally more 'tuneful' in a typically Russian way than the latter three composers. But the elongated harmonic progressions and loose structure better resemble those three than Borodin or Rimsky-Korsakov.  I'm not sure that anything else by Gliere sounds anything like this; certainly not the horn concerto. It isn't a truly 'great' work, but it is interesting and unusual enough not to deserve neglect as well. Give it a spin - you might disagree and think that it's an awesome symphony."
AEOBOF2ONQJWV,B00HFG3UC2,5.0,I HAVE ONLY HEARD THIS SONG BY HIM AND I LOVE HIM.  I HAVE ADOPTED HIM.  AND WE DON'T LOOK ANYTHING ALIKE!  LOL!  A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN SKIN PIEMENTATION AND THENM THERE IS MY RED HAIR!  I HOPE THAT MAKIES FOLKS LAUGH!In many ways the most meaningful line in this wonderful is &#34;Clap Along If You Know What Happiness Is To You.&#34;  And as wlways i SHOUT &#34;ABSOLUTELY EVERYBODY BEING ABSOLUTELY FINE ALL THE TIME.&#34;  So I weave a web of HPAPY FOR ALL;!  I DO AS I WILL AND HARM NONE!  AND DO MY POOR BEST TO HELP ALL!  I LOVE!  I LOVE!  For I Am Part Of Al;l That Is And All That Is Is Part Of Me!
A3QRG44SS7JHXQ,B00HFG3UC2,5.0,"This is a wonderfully up lifting, infectious song!  The cd has only two tracks, one with vocals, the other instrumental.  Gives you the opportunity to listen over and over again.  I recently watched Pharrell Williams on an OWN program.  He was moved to tears about the world wide embrace of this song.  It is musical genius.  Bravo!  This arrived in a timely manner as promised.  Packaged well too."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00HFG3UC2,2.0,Pharrell is one of the worst artists i have ever heard and i don't care about his non singing self and his production never has moved me. this cut is catchy despite his non singing self.one of the most overrated acts ever. his singing sounds like Kermit the frog gagging.  i'd be happy if he stopped singing and hurting my ears.
AR4GVTRDS59DR,B00HFG3UC2,5.0,"Typically, I work out about 2-3 times per week because I believe it is important to keep the body, mind and soul fit.  For the longest, I have been jogging\\running to Michael Jackson's song &#34;Smooth Criminal.&#34;  Thereafter, I tried Prince's song called &#34;Let's go crazy.&#34;  However, I discovered the tempo is somewhat inconsistent and probably more suited when utilizing the ellipitical machine.  In any event, I recently received my copy of &#34;Happy&#34; by Pharrell WiIliams and it seems ideal for jogging or running.Initially, the noted song begins @ a moderate and comfortable pace.  Thereafter, &#34;Pharrell&#34; begins to repeat a catchy phrase - &#34;Can't nothin bring me down......your love is too hot.......&#34;  At this very moment, while jogging, the noted phrase signals you that it is time to change your attitude, increase your speed and intensity, and start running &#34;full on.&#34;Overall, &#34;Pharrell's Happy song is great to listen to.  However, if you need inspiration when working out (and I most certainly do), than I highly recommend that you add this song to your Ipod (or &#34;Nano Shuffle&#34; - this is what I used).  And remember, good music is made to inspire you!"
A3SGJJPVYRU2UA,B00HFG3UC2,5.0,Love every since I first heard it on the radio. Pharrell really sings well. This is a happy feel good type of song.
AD1H62BLZDBOH,B00HFUQL4C,4.0,"Its a shame this never got popular, since the whole album is great, party hats being my favorite Track.its just really good."
AAVS2DMY7EUIS,B00HG0G164,5.0,"I'm not particularly fond of country music at all, but the fact that it was Lucy Hale, a.k.a. Aria Montgomery singing, I just couldn't stop myself from pre-ordering this album. Music has always been Lucy's passion. On this album, it definitely shows. Ever since she was on American Juniors a looooong time ago, I knew she could be a star. I liked her then. I love her now. Lucy's becoming a threat in more than one arena now. I really hope she keeps this up. She could be like the country version of Ariana Grande, one who wasn't particularly the main character on their TV series, but went on to become one of the biggest stars outside of the show. I don't claim to predict the future, but I've got a feeling that this won't be the last we hear from the music artist Lucy Hale!"
A2IAGY8W5ADC46,B00HGFILLM,5.0,"I am just not getting tired of this. It sounds great, the songs are big & fun & heavy. The shred makes you smile and the singer is just ball$ out amazing. So much fun. I like this much better than their Omerta release."
AVMJOWP2ZPD2E,B00HGFILU8,3.0,"I am so used to Adams' opera DVDs that listening to this recording left me relatively cold.  Perhaps when it is finally issued on DVD (which may never happen) I'll gain a better undertanding of it. I consider it less impacting than his previous work (and I have everything of his I have been able to find, since he is part of my sacred trilogy, together with Golijov and Glass). Vocally, impeccable."
AD6S428NBJIKP,B00HGTNINY,5.0,"While I appreciate having all these fabulous shows,I wish they were available in one of the high definition fomats ie:dvd-a bluray or sacd"
A2AZC8AY5XBV3M,B00HGTNKE6,5.0,"Paul Byrom formerly of Celtic Thunder has one of the best voices ever. This does not disappoint. His signature tones are perfect for the songs picked. Classical and modern, great for home or work, relaxing or fun."
A1VEO0CRWDVI2I,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"Beck has never been in my top 10.  My son (45) loves them and his all his albums...except this one.  I listened to the clips on A and I liked.  Since purchase I have listened through a few times and I have to say, I love this album.  It is much more &#34;mature&#34; than his earlier work; those fans may abandon him but I think that he will attract a new following.  It's very lyrical & melodic with layered voices and an ethereal feel at times.  A couple of songs remind me of early Moody Blues or Steven Wilson.  A definite BUY."
A34PYYB4L7XJLL,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"I love whatever Beck creates. This one was a little bit more unsusual, but in the climate that I like. I would recommend it to all."
A3PIZKYJRBTSTD,B00HHYEOV8,4.0,"Super Saturday, rainy day sensibilities. This CD is smooth well produce and at time a spatial and aural treat, others a direct acoustic drive into your heart. Well written and well produced. Blackbird Chain is very tasty as are most of these cuts."
AZ58OZNS7SJXQ,B00HHYEOV8,4.0,"Like Modern Guilt and Sea Change, Beck clearly worked hard on Morning Phase, something evident from listening to it. I'm not at all surprised by the critical acclaim this released has received, and Morning Phase will certainly please most Beck fans and earn him an even wider audience, since it's a move towards a more mainstream sound. The indie side of Beck, evident on Sea Change, too, has been replaced by a softer, safer, more mature Beck. At times, I hear some odd mixture of Gordon Lightfoot and The Fleet Foxes. This said, the bulk of the music is excellent and distinctively Beck. The two instrumental, ambient songs (Cycle & Phase) are great, and if you like this type of music be sure to check out Stars of the Lid's 'And Their Refinement of the Decline'. There are only two great, brilliant Beck songs here, imho, songs that are up there - nearly - with Paper Tiger or Nobody's Fault But My Own: Wave (recently played on John Diliberto's Echoes radio program) and Waking Light. (For Waking Light, you'll need to wait till the end for the brilliance.) Solid, most pleasant, but not awing. As a long time Beck fan, since 1994, I think that Morning Phase will be regarded as slightly sub-par Beck in time. A bit too tepid. In overall quality, it's better than Guero or The Information. Odelay, Mutations, Midnight Vultures, Sea Change, and Modern Guilt are, to my ears, all superior; so are Feist's Metals, Cat Power's The Greatest, and Devendra's What Will We Be, and even Alela Diane's To Be Still. Though that certainly is one beautiful CD cover. 4.5 stars."
A1YDNVLHKFZ0BR,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"BREATHTAKING!  This CD is an absolute classic - I've loved Beck since his first, but this one is something California - with shades of Pink Floyd.  Yet it stands alone as something brilliant.  Amazing from start to finish.  A very private and visual record.  Can't say enough but just get it and listen from start to finish and then play all over again.  I think this is his best recording ever.  Ranks among the best of the classics.  Due to lack of radio and MTV this CD may be passed by but in actuality it's his most shining achievement.  Beck you have made your most epic CD yet.  Superb.  Grammy's should be giving him award after award.  Beyond stunning."
ACLZJWRUBF5WL,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"Echoes of classic music by the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, David Crosby, and others serve as guideposts for the listener, and likely for Beck himself, without ever sounding slavish. As With Sea Change, Morning Phase reveals more variety with each listen, unfurling colors the way petals unfold in a time lapse of a blossoming flower. At first, I heard what seemed an uninterrupted haze of acoustic guitars, strings and gentle percussion, but soon began to crave the individual songs and their details. The warm ostinato of Heart Like A Drum, the brooding rhythm of Unforgiven, the perfect Kenny Buttrey drums of Country Down, and finally the apotheosis of Waking Light, which builds to an explosive (in this context) Leslie-fied guitar solo and ends the album with a solid crunch that is both startling and satisfying.Full review here: [...]"
A106AGKJWLEOVP,B00HHYEOV8,4.0,"Rather than reviewing Morning Phase, I would like to play spot the influence, or who does that sound like?.The obvious selections are CSNY and Paul Simon, but my music-addled memory has picked out a few others.  To my mind I can hear the Ozark Mountain Daredevils on Blackbird Chain, and touches of Turn Away remind me of Bram Tchaikovsky's Bloodline.  Call me crazy, but that's my belief!"
A15DQK7MICWV4E,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"I've been a kind of reluctant fan of Beck.  Begrudgingly acknowledging the quality of albums like: Modern guilt, The Information and Odelay, while thoroughly enjoying Seachange and Mutilation.  This new album is for my tastes his best offering yet.  The 40 sec intro sounding like something Eagles would do as a filler or reprise, starts off and you get the sense immediately that here is something that needs to be taken notice of.  Morning and Blue Moon are gorgeous tunes.  A bit of mid album dream/drone pop followed by the melodic delight that is Blackbird Chain.  Similar to Jonathan Wilson's recent work, the overall feel is of a Laurel Canyon masterpiece from yesteryear.  There is a lot of music made similar to this but none better.  An early contender for album of the year.  Brilliant!!"
A2XUGB90ZE04QM,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,I play this over and over. It makes me think I would like Beck Hansen personally. This is just right for anyone who's woken up bruised and thought about how to carry on.
A1KNFYE8B0D5E5,B00HHYEOV8,3.0,"Years in the making Beck offers up thirteen new trackson what can only be described as mediocre variationson a rather repetitive theme .Well produced and meticulously performed this harmoniccollection of music stumbles to get out of second gear withhomage paid to previous folk and country inspired artistslike Poco - America -  Souther, Hillman & Fury while lackingthe veritable progressive bite and variety that made Beckthe internationally acclaimed artists he used to be .A lengthy hiatus might rekindle creative juices  for some butin this case it has done nothing to extend his musical reach .Tracks Of MeritCycle -  Morning  -  Heart Is A Drum  .Morning Phase - 3 Stars  -  Buy It Or Fly It ? .Buy It  -  Just  -  PC  -  LA"
A152HV6669BVV6,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"It's very tempting to compare this with Sea Change.  I see it as a natural move away from some of the Electronica Funk that has dominated his intervening albums. The songs nicely twist from one to the next, each with a unique texture.  The album is so nuanced, that it never sounds the same twice.  Can you spell Masterpiece?"
AGC8S0U7W23FQ,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,"I have never really paid attention to Beck, until now. Heard this featured on Spotify and immediately ordered it from Amazon. This album is just stunning. If you don't like moody melodic music, skip it. I'm a big fan of John Cale, who was once described as having mastered &#34;the drone.&#34; It was a compliment. Beck seems to have mastered it, too -- a high compliment. Also reminiscent of Cale is the lyrical quality of Beck's melodies -- ballads with sumptuous harmonies and strings. (Yet the two musicians are very, very different.) This is wonderful stuff that I'll be spinning a long time. Now it's time to work through his catalogue... I love new discoveries of old talent..."
A1I4FJITI6QG53,B00HHYEOV8,5.0,Recorded at Ocean Way and mixed at Electric Ladyland.  This is anothe one of those stellar Beck LP's that will soon be out of print and a collectors item.  Pick it up while you can.  Excellent all the way!
A6J7UPYUI96XO,B00HJ7IO0A,5.0,"First off, let me start by saying that Bach sounds as good at age 46 as he did at age 19, when the first Skid Row album was recorded. Back in his days with the band, Bach proved that he could handle all types of hard rock, whether it was on the band's straight ahead follow up to the debut (1991's &#34;Slave to the Grind&#34;) or 1995's grunge metal influenced (and vastly underrated &#34;Subhuman Race&#34;). His solo work has been good to this point (especially &#34;Angel Down&#34;), but this is by far his best album to date.What sets this album apart from the rest of his solo work is the quality of songs. A few tracks stand out as exceptional (&#34;Hell Inside My Head,&#34; in particular); &#34;Harmony&#34; is structurally similar, though more melodic, to the &#34;Subhuman Race&#34; songs. The southern rock tinged &#34;Rock and Roll is a Vicious Game&#34; is a nice little gem too (attn Bret Michaels: THIS is how you do this kind of music and make it stick with the listener). Steve Stevens is, as always, excellent. Proficient, tuneful, fast when he needs to be, and a good songwriter to boot.Bottom line, if you love the 3 Skid Row albums with Bach, pick this up. If you like Bach's previous solo work, pick this up because it's better. If you love melodic hard rock delivered with a purpose, which gives a nod to the good old days but does not sound a bit outdated, pick this up. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars."
A2X87E8A5AC9Q2,B00HJ7IO0A,5.0,&#34;Temptation&#34; is one of the great new heavy rock songs! Great retro/modern feel at the same time. An instant classic. Bach is back!
A2C621SQPRMNL9,B00HJ7IO0A,4.0,"This cd really kicks. Sebastian Bach outdoes himself on this one.  If only we had radio stations that had balls to play hard rock (not classic rock).  The April Wine cover, \"Rock N Roll Is A Viscous Game\" sticks out like a sore thumb but the rest are tremendous.  I for one am not a big fan of that song on here.My review of  Give Em Hell is as follows:\"Hell Inside My Head\" - Starts off pretty cliche and then all of a sudden,  Sebastian starts to show why he is still around after all these years.  It travels melodically down a dark path and then he wails beyond anything that other singers are putting out\"Harmony\" - What can I say, it never stops!  You think it is going to be a mellow entry and when he lets out \"Harmony\", you just have to play it again to make sure you heard it correctly.  Wow,  Play it again, and again!\"All My Friends Are Dead\" - I think this single was released to perk the interest in the dark/gothic side of fans.  When I first heard it, I really liked it and, I was hooked, and pre-ordered the CD.  I am so glad I did (and you will be too).\"Temptation\" - It \"gets the best of me\" and it does indeed.  Bas' range shows itself throughout this song.  It starts to make you feel comfortable and then bites right into you and drops back down to a mellow moment.  Then he roars back with \"Temptation\" (the chorus)\"Push Away\" - This song is deep.  Starts slow and then quickly revs up and lets you know the emotions of a relationship in turmoil.  What goes through one's mind emotionally.\"Dominator\" -  This is one of my favorites.  I love the opening when he belts out \"You know you drive me wild, you angelic demon child.  A living succubus you want me\"  It just starts off going and going and does not stop!\"Had Enough\" - This ballad is tender and from the heart.  I almost feel silly saying that about Sebastian Bach's music.  It is well done.  The lyrics jump out and grab you for this emotional flight.\"Gun to a Knife Fight\" -  Great title.  Screeching takes you through the start of the gut wrenching musical fight.  Descriptive lyrics about a bullet through brain, catch one's senses off guard and then it smooths out for a moment and revs back up.\"Rock N Roll is a Viscous Game\" - This April Wine cover is definitely not as good as the original but it is a nice change of pace for this CD.  It does stand out like a sore thumb but it is not a bad cover.  It is well done.\"Taking Back Tomorrow\" - Another favorite of mine.  His vocals definitely capture your attention throughout this song.  Although the musicians behind Sebastian are fantastic, he just overwhelms the instruments with his power!\"Disengaged\" -  Starts off very similar to several other songs on this CD with the drum roar and again, Sebastian comes roaring through the song with blind abandonment.  All of a sudden, he takes this song to another level when he belts out, \"I don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay alone\" and you find yourself singing along.  Rock on!\"Forget You\" -  Sebastian is first out of the gates with this song and then the drums follow him down this dark path. Shivers go down your spine as he accelerates the tempo and then we are finished!I would give each song stars but they are all so good.  Buy the CD and you will see the Dark Maestro at work.  You won't regret it!"
ACZDKCFXU6HZS,B00HJ7IO0A,5.0,"I have been a HUGE fan of Sebastian Bach since the 80's when he was in Skid Row. This is one of the most complete albums of his career, very melodic, great backing musicians, & solid songs. This album grows on you more every time you listen to it. The range of Sebastian's voice is amazing, & he delivers it all through the album. I highly recommend this to everyone, especially long time fans!!!"
A30QYLEYJALH35,B00HJ7IO0A,5.0,"Give 'em Hell has met with mixed reviews and an &#34;as well as can be expected&#34; sort of sales report. Bach, himself has admitted his confusion at the disparity between his number of facebook fans and his record sales and unfortunately, I think a lot of Bach's own comments make him an easy target and in turn, tarnish people's perception of the music before they have given it much of a chance. I think much of the criticism has been unwarranted. And I will say this for Bach, despite his reputation, a combination of arrogance, ignorance and overall immaturity (a reputation that he himself has perpetuated in too many interviews and reality tv shows) he does genuinely LOVE the music. I have been reading interviews with artists for over 30 years that faithfully report that their newest work is their best work, when we all know that it's not, and Bach isn't saying this is better than Skid Row, but he clearly loves it and he is very proud of it and I have to say, it is refreshing to hear that sort of honest enthusiasm, especially coming from such a veteran performer. That being said, the new album, for what it is, is actually really good. This is not Skid Row. Bach has gone darker and heavier, more modern &#8230; His singing fits the music perfectly and his voice is still there. There has been a lot of talk (a lot of it by Bach, himself) about his screams (and they are good), but his control in the lower register is what makes his range really impressive. Beyond just the sonic range though is the emotional depth that his vocals bring to the songs. It&#8217;s just a terrific performance. Maybe his best. The music has taken a lot of abuse, but don&#8217;t let that scare you off. Most of the people complaining simply can&#8217;t get past that this doesn&#8217;t sound like Skid Row, and that&#8217;s true (trust me, those guys couldn&#8217;t play this material). But his band is good, and the sound is unique. And even with two or three guest guitarists contributing songs, Marlette kept it all sounding like one consistent album. Honestly, I have no complaints with this cd.Scott - RATHOLE.com"
A1S1BJFTA644TU,B00HJ7IO0A,5.0,"Finally, Bach is back to himself.  I love this guy, but he went through a musical slump--in my opinion.  His last album was the awakening of the beast that is Sebastian Bach.  Give 'Em Hell is the beastly god of metal back in action!This album is worth buying.  No question.  If you truly love Bach, and all that he can do with that voice, you will not be disappointed.  He showcases interesting melodies and awesome screams like never before.The songs are interesting, fresh, and full of grooves that you can bang your head to with pride.  A feast for metal head ears."
A38HBS1XWFJF6,B00HJ7IO96,4.0,"Pretty Maids latest audio cd, DVD release. Titled(louder than ever) is a exciting listen. The Musicianship is very strong. Take a listen if you dare. Volume, full power."
A1RLR76UR04D4N,B00HK613HQ,5.0,Bought this album on impulse and man I'm going to get more of Chris's music!  Great mix - excellent beats!  Chill out and relax now with this album!
AVV5JGLBZERCM,B00HMQBFL8,5.0,"Depression, suicide, and the American illusion are some of the topics covered on this album of classic Pharoahe Monch rhymes with beats that fit his personality.  It is bad ass and smart.  The lyrics are intricate, complex, indelible and perfectly flowed.  It has true meaning unlike a lot of projects put out these days by lesser emcees."
A1JUKS0DSO2XZG,B00HN6W5S4,5.0,"This is absolutely terrific.  It is a recording of a 2013 concert by Steve Martin and his collaborators and I think it's brilliant from start to finish.The music is bluegrass in all its forms with some traditional and some contemporary songs, many taken from previous Steve Martin studio albums.  The first thing to say is that the musicianship is quite phenomenal.  Martin himself is s genuinely excellent banjo player and his band and fellow singers (including the great Edie Brickell) are just as good.  The sheer precision of the playing and harmony singing is truly impressive and allows the fun and in places genuine pathos to shine through.It's a mixed programme with varying moods - when you get to Asheville, for example, is genuinely affecting - but the overriding feeling is of fun and genuine laughs occasionally.  As examples, Atheists Don't Have No Songs is a quite brilliant blend of superb harmony singing and clever, witty lyrics, Pretty Little One tells a rather important morality tale with genuine humour, and some of the instrumental work in tracks like Auden's Train is breathtakingly good and just makes me smile with pleasure.If you like bluegrass or any sort of folk music, or just appreciate fine musicianship and warm-hearted good humour you will like this.  I love it, and recommend it very warmly indeed."
AQV142R2H69QK,B00HNR3ZBE,5.0,"They say if you wait ages for a bus then two will come along, this maxim now appears to apply to American Soul Bands. The emergence last year of the Alabama Shakes and their mighty lead singer vocalist Brittany Howard a veritable force of nature brought real cheer to those who like their music soulfully stirred and infused with Muscle Shoals devout passion. The owners of Single Lock Records sit in this tradition including John Paul White of the now defunct Civil Wars and Ben Tanner of said Alabama Shakes. In signing St Paul & The Broken Bones it must have felt that Christmas came early.The band hail from Alabama and its six members come fully formed and schooled in the best traditions of the music of Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, O V Wright and Al Green. The band however are not revivalists for like the Shakes they are regenerators breathing new life into a timeless tradition that should ever so frequently bang on our doors and demand substantial quality time on the stereo. The lead singer of the band is another surprise package. Indeed Paul Janeway might do for soul what Paul Potts did for opera. He is an unlikely frontman, looking like a mix of Huey Long and Bill Gates yet singing like his black soul heroes with a voice which he should insure for millions. He is a star in the making and once you have heard that voice you are going to return time after time. \"Half the City\" is the bands debut and in terms of consistency it tops \"Boy and Girls\" by the Alabama Shakes in terms of sheer joy de vivre and deep down desire.Play this album to any musical acquaintance and the first astonished words uttered will be \"Who the f*** are they\"? Check out Janeway's vocal on \"Like a Mighty River\" with its superb horn backdrop and powerhouse chords and try not to be impressed. This is a vocalist who was trained in the gospel tradition at his local Pentecostalist Church and doesn't it show. Similarly their live standard \"Call Me\" floats along with an effortless soul groove that could only be the product of a veteran band who have played thousands of club to be this tight and together. Undoubtedly this will be the case as St Paul and the Broken Bones storm every venue they currently play but we would do well not to forget that some of these musicians are straight out of college.The high voltage soul on \"Half the City\" is relentless. Echoes of Otis Redding abound on the slow emotional ballad \"Broken Bones & Pocket Change\" an absolute showstopper of a song. It is matched by the wonderful closer \"Its Midnight\" all dark and burning with passionate intensity. For a bit of lighter relief turn to the funky title track and the almost Dexys sounding \"Dixie Rothko\" with a huge Janeaway vocal. Overall this is an album which wears its heart on its sleeve, it want to entertain, to pull at your emotions and to make you punch the air. It is a soul debut to die for and makes of polyvinyl chloride had better stock up because \"Half the City\" is going to exhaust their supplies when it hits the shops."
A1NFUVMLK4C2OI,B00HNR3ZBE,5.0,"R&B and Soul music of this caliber has not existed since the 60's or earlier 70's. St. Paul and the Broken Bones have revived a sound that is sadly non-existent in the music of today. If you loved Sam Cooke, Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, then you'll love these guys. In concert they pay tribute to these icons, but this album is truly their own!"
A1X8OP6LC264OM,B00HNTUR1S,5.0,"Solid recording, good song selection, good audio quality.If your a Allman Brothers Fan worth the purchase.IMO the best period of the group"
A2VEM6DZK8SEQ9,B00HNTUR1S,5.0,I always am a little histent buying another ABB recording. This one is excellent and i am glad I have added it to my collection.

AILGCFXH3NN7Y,B00HNTUR1S,5.0,"I listened to this thinking it was just going to be another rehashing of classic Allman Brothers songs. I could NOT have been more wrong. These 2 CD's are filled with some great music. They are simply on fire from the first note to the last. It doesn't matter when or where it was recorded, this music is timeless. I really like the current line up of the Brothers, but this twin guitar line up of Warren and Dickie is simply killer. Dickie brings back a lot of memories of the classic Allman Brothers sound. He is simply tremendous here. That sound is what's really missing in the band today. This is highly recommended."
A3GKOOYNYL72P3,B00HNTUR1S,5.0,"Americans do this Blues-country-folk Rock so well, and none better than ABB. I once wrote a harsh review of &#34;Eat a Peach&#34;. Forget that wayward set.This is the real deal. And, forget &#34;Live At Fillmore E&#34;. Magnificent as that set was, this is very different, even the treatments of the early songs.We have a collection of new workings of old ABB pillars, and a set of works released closer to the recording dates.The recording is true, warm, almost intimate.The musicianship flawless, and the arrangements fresh and exciting.I would like to have been there.No stand-outs, so evenly well performed.Ignore this at your peril."
A2SE11JTVZ477X,B00HNTUR1S,5.0,If you are an Allman Brothers fan this is a must have album.  It really takes you back in time.
ANL5LPLZ626Z0,B00HNVR8DG,5.0,"I had the pleasure of listening to the work of Masako, when last year she released her debut album called, Masako. She is a beautiful composer of depth and colour and brings a much needed extra something to the very swollen ranks of solo piano genre.&#8220;Call of the Mountain&#8221; as a follow up had a lot to live up to after her debut, but to start it with the pictorial piece &#8220;Dawn&#8221; a real album opener of such beauty and reverence was a sublime decision and then to almost burst into the composition Kindness From Strangers was even more inspired, this too is a track full of majesty and grace and at times when listening to Masako you could almost picture an angel caressing the keys.Masako has a style all of her own that at times seems regal, at moments angelic and at other periods, just radiates a feeling of total exquisiteness. Just listen to the track Bigfoot Forest for an example of her genius, this is a composition filled with suspense and mystery and a little melancholy thrown in for good measure, this is a piece that will literally take you on a hand in hand journey through the woods and who knows, you may see a squatch, but the BFO are nowhere to be seen!Now for something completely different, Masako firmly enters the New Age music genre with her piece &#8220;Watching The Clouds&#8221; a delicate song filled with percussion and a repetitive piano piece with some very adept percussion to sooth us along on this path of pure peace, Masako is joined by none other than Premik Russell Tubbs on Wind Synthesizer and the man himself Will Ackerman on guitar, the steady beat of floating percussion is by courtesy of the very classy and stylish Jeff Haynes, who for me personally made this track.Want something special? Then the track A Highland Tale is your piece, this is a very powerful track, while the piece itself is quite short, there is a certain dominance within this composition that demands to be listened to. I have heard something similar way back in the 1970&#8217;s from Emerson Lake and Palmer&#8217;s Keith Emerson, on the album Tarkus and it still works beautifully.Talking about beautiful, try listening to the stunning refrains of Reflections, one could easily picture a mirrored pool in a clearing, perhaps in Bigfoot Forest, try giving yourself to this song, it is a tale of outstanding beauty, this is a composition of utter magnificence, I actually found this piece the most emotional to listen to from the album and found it provoked some interesting moments of reflection from me whilst listening to it.The Day of Crossing the Hudson is glorious; Ackerman has produced a total gem of an album here and this composition is one of the many that stands out from the release, but while this piece has a light feel about it, there is also an undertone of depth within the track as well. Much can also be said for the following composition called Mountain Trolley Remembered, this is a song that once more makes us reflect, the style of this the shortest piece on the album is in ultra reflective mode.There is nothing wrong with a little indulgence from time to time and as such dear constant reader, I would ask you to indulge yourself within this composition called quite aptly, Purple Indulgence. Using the very talented Eugene Friesen on Cello, Masako commits herself entirely to one of my favourite pieces off the album. In a way it took me back too many years to admit, to a piece I used to adore, a flip side by Neil Sedaka called Lightning Ride, whilst the speed is different, the progression of the music has a similar element in it for me, and I can see myself playing this one on many shows to come.Wildflowers as a track name is going to say it all, but don&#8217;t take this piece for granted, this is a gentle, beautiful and respectful repose into nature, a piece that really gives us time to breath in what has been a breath taking album so far. The scene is set, the solo piano player is engaged, now let&#8217;s see if you can just relax and enjoy the pictorial pleasure created by the Masako.Blue Blaze is a track in almost two different dimensions, it has a carefree sense about it, but also then jumps into a state of tension and even mystery, it is as if the artist is telling a tale through the composition and Blue Blaze certainly has a real narrative about it, a narrative that finishes abruptly with a sense of relief on the last note.Once more Masako slips into reflective mode within the track Precious and this one could easily see her sitting by a window in the studio, just gently stroking the keys whilst watching the sunset on what has been a glorious day and within this piece we can feel a certain reflective respect coming through, this is a composition of gratitude and respect, with a tiny hint perhaps of regret?The Other side of Tristesse sees the longest piece on the album and combines many talents on what will become a classic piece to revere in years to come; now this is musical creativity at its best. Masako out does herself on this composition that really takes the listener on a journey through a myriad of emotions and dimensions, this almost felt like a spiritual musical jam session, with all the artists just hitting a total symbiosis of creative genius in a track that grew and grew. There is some stunning guitar work on here from Ackerman, who is joined by Jeff Haynes on percussion and an angelic vocal from Noah Wilding sealed the deal for this outstanding track.Well dear constant reader, the night is falling once more and out of my studio window, this winter continues on unabated, but to ease that lethargy at least I have the track Smoky Rain, now rain is something we in the UK know a lot about and most of us are born with flippers and gills, but this is one of those tracks that really does what it says on the can, it&#8217;s a rain piece! So enjoy it, just be a big kid, run out into it and listen to this track while doing so and you will see it&#8217;s the soundtrack to your endeavours.The penultimate composition to this incredible album is called Mt Kathdin. This is located in the or more accurately on the Appalachian Trail. Now I have only ever seen this place from the air, but who knows one day I may venture up into the hills and if I do, I shall remember to take this album and this very track with me on my journey, it is an idyllic piece filled full of beautiful moments of musical magic and a piece that really emphasises Masako&#8217;s class a pianist.So dear reader and listener, our sojourn in the world of Masako&#8217;s &#8220;Call of the Mountains&#8221; is about to be completed with a track called &#8220;Lullaby for the Hills&#8221;. Hill walking is my favourite pastime, it brings me freedom, it brings me liberation and most of all it brings me peace. Masako has created a superb track to end the album with and I could easily imagine myself sitting on the hillside watching the last rays of the sunset on a day that will forever stay within my mind&#8217;s eye. Including the world&#8217;s best Flugelhorn player in Jeff Oster on this last composition was a stroke of genius.Call of the Mountains is just what the Solo Piano genre needed; here we have an album jam packed to the top with total class and creativity, an album superbly produced by Acerkman and Eaton to such a fine level that the bar has firmly been now.Call of the Mountains is an album that will move you, it is an album that will bring your peace, it&#8217;s an album that will liberate you and it&#8217;s is an album that I would personally recommended for you to place in your musical collection, for here we you will listen to a musician who really feels every inch of what she plays."
A1VW80DXX9KA1N,B00HOGRIPS,1.0,"This is pop country.  It is embarrassing to listen to.  I know a lot of people like this stuff same as a lot of people like Britney Spears or Lady Gaga.  If you do some research on Cole, you may find he really has no business behind a microphone.  If you're a male over the age of 18 and &#34;love&#34; this album,  you are more douchy than Summer's Eve, guaranteed.  Please people - this shouldn't be considered country music at all.  This is pop country, a genre destined to destroy real country music.  If you want some real country - check out Sturgill Simpson.  If that's too country for you, try Blackberry Smoke.  Raise the bar people."
A1YTLL3606WSQZ,B00HQ0BTKM,5.0,"I'll get right to the point.  This CD may have to be surgically removed from my player, because it will probably get stuck in there.  I can't take it out.  If you love pop music, with great hooks, exploding from your speakers, this is it.  Talk about hidden gems: &#34;Baby Hold On&#34; was a mid-chart record in 1970, that radio has long forgotten.  Crank it up, and see if you can get it out of your head. Thanks to everyone who had a hand in putting this package together."
AS5TPFGVTS2AA,B00HQ0BTKM,2.0,"Had been waiting a long time for them to finally &#34;remaster&#34; all the Grass Roots music and was very excited to read that it had been done . The &#34;professional reviews&#34; were glowing prior to release which amp'ed up the anticipation even more ....BUT , when it arrived and I listened :  it falls way short of anything new. I even set up 2 cd players w/ a mixer and did one vs. the other comparrison at the same time and heard no difference at all. Nothing new here on the sound side , but they are all here on one disc and if your into liner notes there is some interesting reading ."
A3USV9WPL61KPC,B00HQ0BTKM,5.0,"I am very pleased with this release! If for no other reason than the inclusion of the censored Let's Live For Today and the single version of Temptation Eyes, it would be welcome. The sound quality is terrific and the song selection is great (a couple of my favorites didn't sell well.....Wake Up, Wake Up and A Melody For You), but are included. This was a much maligned band, and IMHO they were underrated. While I also love the stereo versions, it's great to sit back and listen to these the way they were heard on the radio. Highly recommended!"
A2HTVUB41X9RAM,B00HQ0BTKM,5.0,"For the first time ever, all of the original mono singles! No re-recordings or alternate stereo mixes. This is how those songs were played on the radio. Great sound quality and very informative booklet."
A1QJ5AX049KOGM,B00HQI83RQ,5.0,"This concert of some 20 years ago was a wonderful and totally deserved tribute to a man many regard as popular music's greatest songwriter and who amazingly remains so today. We are fortunate to have lived in the same times that this remarkable man wrote and performed (and is still performing) his classic songs. An amazing list of performers including several no longer with us (e.g. George Harrison, John and June Cash, Levon Helm and Rick Danko) along with Bob work through classic after classic Dylan song and do so brilliantly! I think it's a dead heat between this concert and The Band's Last Waltz for the mantle of greatest show on earth!"
A23SY7NU7HY3QY,B00HQRYJE8,5.0,"It's no secret that he's long been one of my favorites, but Riser even exceeded my expectations.  There are plenty of heart-wrenching sad songs, but there are also great, up-tempo ones like &#34;Drunk on a Plane&#34; to keep you moving along.My favorites so far are: Say You Do, Drunk on a Plane, Riser, Back Porch and Hurt Somebody.All in all, Riser is a nice mix of everything you love about Dierks (even if we are still minus those lovely, chaotic curls).  Well worth the wait."
A2JSOWI419DKEU,B00HQRYJE8,4.0,"Happy to own this CD, it is right in line with his other music.  Kids like it, hubby likes it, we're all good."
A3MAX9NRH41BOJ,B00HS7BZIE,4.0,"This album is fantastic.  We certainly have not seen the beginning of the end of Real Estate, though I personally believe that Days was a better album as a whole.  Wonder Years is one of my absolute favorite songs (though incidentally was not very good live), but there is some gold on this album as well.  Talking Backwards, being the teaser single, will certainly be stuck in your head all day!"
A12W8NRSYR593I,B00HS7BZIE,5.0,"Only took a few listens to certain songs here and there and I was impressed by how much they have refined their sound! What a sweet gazer-esque, ethereal album! If you have their other one you will love this one! Enjoy!"
AV5STNS0LQLZA,B00HS7BZIE,5.0,"Anyone familiar with Real Estate's sound should know what to expect: jangly guitars, smooth mid-range vocals, and lyrics that resonate a pining for a simpler life.  With Atlas, Real Estate pick up where they left off with Days but this time the themes are explored more deeply.  With Martin Courtney now married, the focus on Atlas shifts slightly from Real Estate's past repertoire; on this record, Martin and the band are very much rooted in the present.Had To Hear &#8211; A nice little lead riff leads in a song that recalls the debut album but through the clean production lens of Days.  This track sets the tone for the rest of the album.Past Lives - Arguably the most Yo La Tengo-esque track on the album, a warm 70's keyboard and ride cymbal keep tempo as Martin laments over memories of the long-lost suburbs, in keeping with Real Estate tradition.Talking Backwards - It's obvious why this song was chosen as the single.  The fastest, most uptempo track of the bunch, Talking Backwards is an instant classic and shows how much the band has grown in the last year.April's Song - An instrumental that sounds like montage music for a bunch of people having a good time on a road trip.  This song will find its place on many mix CDs to come.  Blissful, hazy perfection.The Bend - The background sounds like a chorus of crickets giving this track major nighttime vibes.  Easily the most introspective track on the album.Crime - Reminiscent of that early-90's hit &#34;Big Me&#34; by Foo Fighters.  Intricate riffs and pleasant echoey chords abound.  Long live the electric guitar.Primitive &#8211; This song could very possibly be the next single.  A bit more melancholy than their usual fare but when the chorus rolls around, it's such a sweet relief.How Might I Live - Was this song recorded in 1972?  Everything about this song smacks of the era's nature-obsessed folk rock (in the best way possible, of course) with Bleeker's twangy voice taking center stage.Horizon &#8211; Fresh off the down-South folkiness of the last track, Horizon retains a very western folk guitar and bass interplay that complement the vocals nicely with pastoral lyrics that tie the whole thing together.Navigator - The chorus breathes and really let's the lyrics sink in. The tableau is one of minute beauty.  &#34;Cross the kitchen floor / steal out the back door / past the monument / I'll meet you where the pavement ends.&#34; Like a short story by Raymond Carver, this song isn't so much about what is said but rather what has been left unsaid.Despite the fact that Real Estate's guitar playing will always sound wistful and classic in a way very few bands can pull off, Atlas seems to shy away from the overtly nostalgic intentions of Days, instead focusing on a new chapter of life; one fraught with miscommunication (Talking Backwards), occasional regression (Past Lives), and reluctantly forging a path into adulthood (Crime).  As Real Estate continues to hone in on their sound, the production only grows more lush and the songs more meaningful.  We'll be hearing from the guys for a long, long time."
AQV142R2H69QK,B00HS7BZIE,4.0,"The only way to describe the new album by New Jersey stalwarts &#34;Real Estate&#34; is to echo the title of a sadly forgotten album by the Scottish band the Cosmic Rough Riders. Indeed their opus &#34;Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine&#34; has some similarities with &#34;Atlas&#34; since it often drew copious comparisons with bands like the Byrds, REM, Teenage Fanclub and the Jayhawks which are shared reference points for Real Estate. This album is essentially a blast of warm colour into a winter characterised by black sheets of rain. It is not a difficult listen by any standards, but there is real depth to be located in its grooves. It is safe to say that by the third listen &#34;Atlas&#34; will be a really good familiar old friend, one which you will turn to when you are confused for choice and you when you desire a reliable set of heartwarming shimmering pop rock headed up with with a capital &#34;Q&#34; for quality.Things start well on &#34;Atlas&#34; and get better. Indeed this reviewer has had to be dragged screaming from playing the first three tracks on repeat. The lovely opener &#34;Had to Hear&#34; jingles and jangles with Gene Clark like chords and a melody to kill for. It is splendidly bettered by the forlorn &#34;Past Lives&#34; destined to be the soundtrack as the dying embers of a summer barbecue fade into a dark night sky. Best of all is the joyous single &#34;Talking Backwards&#34; where the mix of Martin Courtney's bittersweet vocals and the flowing guitar lines of Matt Mondanile's pulsating guitar melodies reach a true synthesis. The joyful instrumental &#34;April Song&#34; reinforces this but the clinchers come later with the brilliant chiming chords of &#34;Primitive&#34; which is the best Norman Blake song he never wrote; concluding with a nice guitar workout to seal the deal. This blissed out state concludes with &#34;Navigator&#34; a melancholy ode to the way that time passes and defeats us.Ultimately you know what you get with this band. It may be that a &#34;Real Estate plays Death Metal&#34; album might be lurking in the depth of some unlikely recording vault, yet for now &#34;Atlas&#34; comfortably surpasses any of the bands previous two efforts and if their sin is &#34;predictability&#34; then their massive strength is great songwriting and the best ear for melody this side of Michael Stipe."
A2JYYOZ224DP3I,B00HSVEDYI,5.0,"that has this Brown Eyed Girls' ear! I am now a fan and will be.  Can't wait to see how he grows.  If this is any indication, he's going to be just fine."
A3EE9BEJ6L3P0E,B00HSVEDYI,2.0,"Seeing as his track with Marsha is AMAZING, expected more from this release. Only gets two stars for that song alone."
A3N3E84SX7X4BM,B00HSVEDYI,5.0,"This man's voice is angelic, smooth, and soulful.  I've been a HUGE fan since he dropped his LP.Some of the same songs on the LP are on this cd, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable."
A2B1I4HFWOK9DQ,B00HSVEDYI,5.0,"... beautiful music through and through. We heard one song at West-Gray Hou TX Cinema lobby, and got it same night on AMAZON ... - great SOUL MUSIC."
ASZQK7QMVR5XA,B00HT5G8EQ,5.0,"I have read many reviews about Carnifex. Most of them positive. That's because they are a different breed of Deathcore. This album has all the elements of the genre but it is the way they deliver it. Ever since I bought Hell Chose Me I have been a fan. Carnifex is one of the best metal bands out right now. They went to Nuclear Blast and enlisted Jordan Lockery, who adds a technical side to the band. Shawn Cameron is an absolute beast behind the kit. Corey Arford is a solid rhythm guitarist and definitely brings trademark Carnifex on this album. Salvation Is Dead is an awesome opener and really sets the tone for the whole album. I actually thought I might be disappointed with the rest of the album and then Dark Days starts off and I was impressed. Dragged From The Grave and Rotting Souls are truly brutal. The title track does not let up either. If this is your introduction to Carnirex, welcome to the club"
A1RNSJIOGBUYCC,B00HUAP0NK,5.0,"Its nothing new to say that I was introduced to this magnificent band by their breakout single \"Pumped Up Kicks\" in 2011.  I heard the song before it broke out and I just knew it was going to be a phenomenon.  Then their debut album \"Torches\" was released shortly after.  It was a good soundtrack for my weeks leading to my graduation from High School and the summer ahead.  Many have called the sound of the album \"Perfect Pop\" and it was so unique.  They sounded familiar yet different at the same time.  The rest of the album proved that there was more to the band than just \"Pumped Up Kicks\".  I couldn't wait for what they had in store for their next album.  I was a fan.  Well nearly 4 years after that classic album graced the world, they finally released a new single \"Coming of Age\" leading up to a new album.  I liked the song, but like many, I found myself comparing it to their most popular song.  It didn't become a huge hit outside of alternative radio sadly.  Another song was released called \"Psuedologia Fantastica\" which had a psychedelic vibe.  I brushed that song off as well at first.  I'm disappointed in myself to say that I skipped on buying this album when it initially came out based on lackluster reviews.  I previewed the songs and they didn't click right away for me enough to buy it.  I had for the first time in a long time, trusted the critics without even giving it a chance and I regret that now.  Months later, I heard the second official single \"Best Friend\" and I liked it immediately.  I then began reading more reviews of the album out of curiosity to see if I had been wrong in dismissing it before.  I began seeing a lot more positive reviews and then I listened to each song for the first time.  I was impressed.  So I finally gave in and purchased the album for the summer of 2014.  Better late than never.  Here's a track by track review.1.  Are You What You Want To Be?:  The opener of the album starts things off with good guitar work before the verses change up and sound more like something of African influence and also similar to some of the tracks from the first album.  The chorus is a grower, but the background vocals of \"la laa laaa\" are catchy right away.  The ending of the song is peaceful, if only it lasted longer!  9/102.  Ask Yourself:  The song contains one of the immediate departures from the first album, which is a prominent acoustic guitar.  The guitar literally glides through the song along with Fosters vocals.  I think I hear some violins during the second verses too and they sound great.  The chorus is anthem worthy, but still nothing groundbreaking.  I love the guitar solo with the bands signature \"woo hoo hoo\"!  9.5/103.  Coming of Age:  At first I didn't think this was an amazing single to promote the album.  But I hear it now and it just hits me harder and harder each time.  It's a true gem and now I'm certain it could've been a bigger hit than it was.  The guitar riff is so catchy it reminds me of the 80s a bit.  The percussion is also nicely done.  I have to again mention the ending containing the \"woo hoo hoo hoos\".  Great summer track!  10/104.  Nevermind:  More acoustic guitars and relaxing vocals.  This track really makes me feel like just saying 'nevermind'.  The chorus sounds like a angst filled anthem from the 90s, in a good way!  Very different from the first albums material.  I'd love to hear more of this sound in future releases.  Multiple listens reveal more hidden aspects to the song as with most good songs.  The title of the song brings to mind \"Nirvana\", which is nice as the ending of the song has a grungy vibe almost! 9.5/105.  Psuedologia Fantastica:  The second song released prior to the album but not as a real single.  At first I didn't really like it that much.  But now that I have reassessed the album I have grown to really like this trippy anthem!  Many have compared it to MGMT, which I disagree with.  I just love the trippy feel of the song.  The synths and guitars are great.  9/106.  The Angelic Welcome Of Mr. Jones:  One of the longest titles is the shortest song.  I don't really like it.  Its just an Acapella, but not really a good one.  No rating.7.  Best Friend:  I believe this song could save the album from being a commercial failure if it continues to hit the airwaves.  Its catchy and the lyrics are easy to relate to.  The funky disco guitars remind me of \"Rollercoaster of Love\" a bit.  There is even a small section toward the end that really makes me think of \"Miss Me\" from the first album.  10/108.  A Beginners Guide To Destroying The Moon:  The title itself just gives me this imagery in my head similar to Smashing Pumpkins album Mellon Collie.  The distorted guitars even sorta remind me of \"1979\".  The song was a grower for me at first.  The vocals reach highs and lows in a cleverly executed way.  The song gets so much better with repeated listens.  It's pretty much a masterpiece in my opinion.  10/109.  Goats in Trees:  Many seem to like this song the least for some reason.  I love the acoustic guitars which take over again.  The vocals and lyrics are strange and mysterious.  Then toward the end the vocals get hauntingly beautiful in a weird way.  The chorus sounds just like what an acoustic FTP song should sound like.  Its almost heartbreaking in a good way.  I love it.  9.5/1010.  The Truth:  For some reason this is my favorite song on the album.  Its instruments are very distorted, but it works so well.  The chorus is so haunting and hard to understand without looking at the lyrics, but its the best chorus on the album for me!  There's even a part of his vocals in the chorus that almost resembles Bono when he sing-talks \"there is a truth\".  Just a strangely beautiful song.  The song just gives me this feeling that I really can't explain.  10/1011.  Fire Escape:  The best of the acoustic songs.  Just a gorgeous and calm ending to the album.  It's just a perfect closer.  10/10So this was a truly different album from their debut, but also somewhat similar at times.  I think one reason the critics didn't connect was because they listened to the album once, then didn't like that it didn't sound just like the first album and they just dismissed it.  I know I did at first.  Another reason the album might not have been as eventful was because they waited too long.  During the years between this and their first outing, there have been many new bands and new sounds in the music world and a lot of people just forgot about FTP.  I really hope something saves this from being a sophomore slump.  It has a good collection of meaningful songs that tell a story.  I love concept albums like this.  The naysayers are going too hard on this album.  In some ways, I find this album better than Torches.  I don't skip a single song other than the interlude.  There are at least 3 songs on Torches that I just loath.  Every song is a gem.  Hipsters and haters can call it pretentious and a disappointment, but I'll call it a masterpiece and the most underrated album of 2014.  I hope this is considered a classic in the years to come as it already is for me.  Recommended for music lovers and FTP fans, as long as you open your mind and give it multiple listens to allow it to steal you away!"
A120UTHQDQIJGH,B00HUAP0NK,4.0,"I'll actually admit right away that I've only heard about half the songs but I wanted to write a review anyway. I love this band, I think they're doing great things. They incorporate older styles while still maintaining their own sound and making it sound modern enough. We need this band in the mainstream to answer to the majority of radio music that plagues the airwaves.That all said this is definitely underwhelming when compared to Torches. There's simply no way they can top that cut. I still think this a great band and I hope they make music for a long time. This is a band that can't be corrupted by their success because they're already making actual music that they want."
A3PFHVS7V4UZTG,B00HUGK78M,5.0,"I would venture to say that RPWL is wanted for making some outstanding music today regardless of the lyrical content.  As evident in quite a bit of their music vast overtones of spirituality or what they believe are prevelant.  This might not suit all, but the music is the piece that delivers.  A logical successor to 'Beyond Man and Time' RWPL once again delivers some fine music and they're all in fine form.  If you've listened to RPWL for any amount of time you will thoroughly enjoy it, hands down!"
A3ENFAM47FAQF5,B00HUGK8OA,1.0,Hate this cd. This is their worst effort so far. Theyd been better off just doing covers songs for the 3rd release. These are their worst bunch of songs. First cd is a classic the last cd was half great and this sucks.
A20DZX38KRBIT8,B00HUGK8OA,1.0,"I believe Steel Panther has hit the dreaded point of irrelevance as the songs on here suck compared to their first two albums.  It's just watered down versions of their previous efforts combined with crappy radio friendly sounding ballets with cheesey lyrics.  We know Pather's lyrics are supposed to be fun/cheese but on this album they are just stupid and not the least bit funny to someone who has heard it all before on their previous releases.  There are like two memorable riffs on this album with the rest sounding like jam sessions with no direction.  I was excited for this album but ended up very disappointed.  The songs on her do not impress, and the videos are even worse they look like early 2000's worst rap videos.....terrible.  Panther got spayed."
ABK5VTHZA8EKK,B00HULTSNC,5.0,"From dustedmagazine.tumblr.com/post/82450586050/liars-mess-muteLike Bj&ouml;rk (and The Doors and Can and a lot of other artists), the members of Liars are making a career out of musical reinvention (while more or less, not alienating their audience, though they may have lost a few Dusted reviewers when casting off the rhythm section on their dance punk debut, They Threw Us All In A Trench And Stuck A Monument). In the same way that you can&#8217;t convince teenagers they&#8217;re in a phase when clothes, hair and attitudes drastically amend, the band focuses really hard on whichever stage of the proud evolution they find themselves, using the right tools and behaviors to pass themselves off as legit &#8211; and if it&#8217;s just an act, Liars is the Daniel Day-Lewis of musicians, as everything they do comes off as passionate and authentic.Seven albums in with Mess, Liars (just multi-instrumentalist Aaron Hemphill and multi-instrumentalist / singer / producer Angus Andrews on this one, drummer Julian Gross relegated to art-work and design until the tour) is keeping with the &#8220;no guitars allowed&#8221; aesthetic fostered on the previous record, WIXIW. They&#8217;re still nodding to early Pop synthesizer proponents (The Human League, Fad Gadget, A Broken Frame era Depeche Mode), and now mixing in a beefed-up, contemporary EDM blast with the je ne sais quoi that the group infuses into everything it touches.&#8220;Take my pants off,&#8221; spoken in a low, manipulated intone, is the first sound we hear on the opener, &#8220;Mask Maker.&#8221; The stern-yet-comical charges continue (&#8220;Use my socks&#8230; smell my socks&#8230; eat my face off&#8230; take my face&#8230; give me your face&#8230;&#8221;), and the wobbly bass underneath leads to a thumping 4/4; it&#8217;s going to make you dance, and the myriad sound effects that pop in and out make your hands do goofy things (think about the dancing you did as a Goth kid in the &#8216;80s where each sound made you pantomime something new&#8230;ahem).As per usual, the group&#8217;s cryptic &#8220;you can decide what I&#8217;m talking about&#8221; lyrics read like Robert Smith&#8217;s journal from 1981: &#8220;I&#8217;m long past saving / I&#8217;m swallowing degenerates whole / It took both ambition and fear to finally figure it out / Well, it looks so appealing in real life / it&#8217;s actually not.&#8221; &#8220;Vox Tuned D.E.D.&#8221; effortlessly follows, as well as &#8220;I&#8217;m No Gold&#8221; which would find a cozy spot on the new Nine Inch Nails record; near the middle of the latter, Andrews reaches a peak falsetto to accentuate the chilling, &#8220;I poured out pistols to the antlered / all the reindeer / I will kill them all,&#8221; and signs off with, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna burn you to a cinder, when the rain comes, lay in ashes / Yours.&#8221; After the vicious, slamming &#8220;Pro Anti,&#8221; the band pauses with &#8220;Can&#8217;t Hear Well,&#8221; a ballad of sorts that employs only a few repeating saw wave lines and Andrews through a CB radio.This marks the point when the genres further blur and the album really gets interesting. &#8220;Mess on a Mission&#8221; skips and blips in an innocuous manner until the shouted choruses. Side B begins with an instrumental (&#8220;Darkslide&#8221;) forged from booming bass drum, stuttering electrical clicks and an ethereal, repeating scrape bent on blurring the tempo. Sexy and swaggering, &#8220;Boyzone&#8221; literally flanges out a Jamaican Dance Hall beat alongside a host of synthetic textures and muggy vocals. The penultimate &#8220;Perpetual Village&#8221; spends nine minutes on tension: building up a beat, smearing controlled feedback, stripping it all away, while Andrews stresses &#8220;I am burning up.&#34;The one constant of Liars&#8217; records is a lamented &#8220;farewell, to be continued&#8221; finale, which is named &#8220;Left Speaker Blown&#8221; this time around. The autobiographical, &#8220;We&#8217;re good with time, not with friends / I hope you&#8217;ll never learn to play music,&#8221; seems directed to the progeny of musicians so wrapped up in artistic perfection that everything and everyone else gets left behind. After Andrews and his delay pedal fade, we&#8217;re left with a trance of drones whose pitches tug downward and an interruption of a kinder voice deep in the mix, asking &#8220;say the word limb&#8221;, &#8220;say the word shove&#8221; etc.On the subject of the group&#8217;s constant changes, Gross once said &#8220;For us, each album is like a new project, rather than a part of one big entity. It works into the idea of Fluxus.&#8221;Andrews has continually expressed that anytime he feels that anyone in the gang is at the apex of mastery &#8212; whether with a style or an instrument &#8212; it&#8217;s time to move on to something else and lounge in the chaos of learning.  (Based on the band&#8217;s progression since 2001, I continually preach that Liars is the Led Zeppelin of this generation.) So now, based on the technical virtuosity displayed on Mess, Liars will be throwing out the computer and synth in favor of whatever it is they haven&#8217;t conquered. Slam poetry?"
A182SY7I1OPU3A,B00HULTSNC,5.0,"....for the MESS-ES, ahem.  this is an absolutely superb tech house record which sounds that much more phenomenal through headphones if you have them.  undoubtedly their best record to date, but buy it at your peril:)"
A1RONW4363RUQ1,B00HUQC4WE,4.0,"This album also contains music with the Trapp Family Singers, well, 3 of them.  They do 'Lonely Goatherd' and other Sound of Music tunes.  Pretty decent listen."
A2ZRGLLISWYMUK,B00HUQC4WE,5.0,"When I describe to others why I like Pink Martini, I always mention the 'surprise' factor in their work -- you never know what pace, language, or little twist they are going to present, and I LOVE that about them.  Dream a Little Dream continues the PM tradition, offering luscious music that often startles because it makes one pay attention, like, &#34;Wha...?&#34;Ah, because it's a cappella with drums (Storm), vs the next one fully orchestrated.  Or this one is in Chinese (Gonxi), or this haunting hymn in African dialect (Rwanda Nziza).  Some offer a full chorus (Die Dorfmusik) while others a single, haunting voice (Edelweiss) that morphs into a family of voices.When I put on my Pink Martini playlist, there is never a risk of being bored!"
A29E0Q47E8CPPO,B00HVIOU64,5.0,"This is a fantastic CD, every song is great.  This will be my album for the summer of 2014.  From start to finish a great album."
A3BTLIGE6C6BF6,B00HVIOU64,5.0,"Often when an album comes out, you find one or two songs that are great and the rest, well...Air-1 started playing Difference Maker and I knew this was an album I wanted to add to my personal collection -- This is outstanding in each and every song -- powerful lyrics, aw- inspiring music, drawing vocals... if there is one album to buy this year, this is IT.There is nothing more really to say ...(except, I would suggest buying the Music CD for a physical copy as that Amazon provides an additional MP3 stream version so that it can become a multi-generational gift -- and the album would make a fantastic gift to anyone who likes music)"
A2TZBNNKGFG9NE,B00HWKJDNG,5.0,"Found this artist on the amazon also-boughts for daft punk. Yay! Get it! It is very nice, chill music. Great for the summertime. I just know it."
A3AUK9UF1OD8NL,B00HWWDUQA,5.0,"I have been a fan of his since the early days with Wham.  As I have grown older my tastes have mellowed (although I still do like a bit of Metallica occasionally) and this is right up there with Older and Patience.  The blending of symphony, jazz and his amazing vocals affirms my belief that he is a once in a lifetime voice.  Jim Morrison, Freddie Mercury and George Michael are the 3 most amazing voices in my lifetime and this album will not disappoint a true fan, especially one who appreciate vocals over &#34;music&#34;."
A3SR2FSNU40ZSD,B00HWWDUQA,4.0,"Unfortunately, Mr. Michael never brought his successful high brow &#34;Symphonica Tour&#34; to the states. In a similar vein as Diana Ross toured with The Two Tenors (Placido Domingo & Jose Carreras) where she did a mixture of symphonic ally arranged material from the Great American Songbook, as well as, some of her classic ballads. Proven once again, there are few original ideas.La Michael culls songs primarily from &#34;Patience&#34; and &#34;Songs from the Last Century&#34; along with beauties like the haunting &#34;Wild is the Wind&#34;' and the equally haunting, &#34;The First Time I Saw Your Face&#34; and &#34;You've Changed&#34;. His songs include &#34;A Different Corner&#34;, &#34;One More Try&#34; and &#34;Cowboys and Angels&#34;. He also did a version of Amy Winehouse's &#34;Love is a Losing Game&#34; that unfortunately is not on this or the Deluxe Edition.I guess after Dreamworks stumbled with the mini masterpiece, &#34;Older&#34; and Columbia gave his label return, &#34;Patience&#34; a lukewarm reception though his European audiences made both those albums near classics.....he decided to bypass a visit to the states. He's also going to Asia and the Anglosphere so maybe we'll get lucky and he will at least hit a few American cities..In the meantime, this is captures a special evening of pure singing sans the rear action of &#34;Faith&#34;."
A2YKU5ZJSDLREO,B00HX0XOBW,5.0,"One of the best metal bands today! Each album they just keep getting better and better! Combing different styles of hard rock and metal from different genres. Theres a little death metal, metal core, hard rock, grunge, amazing guitar playing and always catchy melodies, soulful singing and amazing musicianship. Some songs have sort of a Pantera vibe and others have a kind of Soilwork vibe but it all sounds like Demon Hunter. If your a metal head do yourself a favor and check this band out. I think this is their best album yet!"
AVFXILZOIFXXF,B00HX0XOBW,5.0,"Tucked away in the arctic tundra that is Wyoming sits a super-volcano known to most as &#8220;Old Faithful.&#8221; For centuries this geyser has hidden a brooding power within that, at just the right moment, unleashes itself in spectacular fashion before returning to a period of simmering expectation. This is Demon Hunter personified (even though Ryan makes fun of my home land on a Training for Utopia song). Making their primary living in other trades, Ryan Clark and company often spend long periods of time simmering behind the scenes and beneath the surface. But, in the course of what is now seven historic albums, fans know that a super volcano of metal prowess is constantly brooding and bubbling beneath the surface ready to unleash itself upon the world at regular intervals.Extremist marks that spectacular explosion back onto a scene that the band has long since claimed rulership over. It would be an understatement, therefore, to merely state that expectations are high for this release. Having captured an increasingly rabid cult following since the release of their debut album, the perception has become that DH must raise the bar to uncharted levels time and again. Over the past couple albums, this has seemingly meant getting always heavier and including increasingly thrashy elements, while still balancing in Ryan&#8217;s ability to seamlessly move into clean vocals and power ballads at the drop of a hat.Fans may be surprised, then, to find that with Extremist Demon Hunter has gone back to the drawing board. Although the album certainly has that distinct DH sound which makes incredible use of both sides of Ryan&#8217;s discordant range, the band brings more classic metal elements to the table than ever before. In the pre-release material promoting the album, Clark has stated that this is the single most &#8220;purposeful&#8221; and scrutinized DH album to date.Though each album has its own flair and flavor, Extremist is certainly the most distinctive album on the band&#8217;s discography. Those used to the most recent albums (The World is a Thorn and True Defiance) may be a bit startled by the incorporation of a slower style that creates a &#8220;modern&#8221; take on doom metal and even incorporates light European stylings. However, once that shock wears off the true force of this amazing album is felt. As Clark has stated, each song does feel like it was more highly scrutinized and each lick and riff feels both different and more organic. The overall feel of the album is that of a classic metal masterpiece that fans really, truly, and actually will come back to decades later and still find a welcome and familiar home.All said, Extremist finds DH at the top of their game. Though I would argue that the band has never created a poor album, I have personally been less and less connected with each release since Storm the Gates of Hell. Putting this statement in context, however, is the fact that Demon Hunter&#8217;s &#8220;worst&#8221; is heads and shoulders above most other bands&#8217; absolute best efforts. Extremist, though is more than a return to form&#8230; it is a rebirth that has riveted me to the music in a way that I haven&#8217;t quite felt as strongly since the band&#8217;s &#8220;golden age&#8221; (Summer of Darkness, The Triptych, Storm the Gates of Hell).As Clark set out to do, each song seems to carry its own weight while still progressing the overall album theme. Though DH has never had a problem excelling musically, this album brings an even higher instance of scorching riffs and masterful solos, with the overall effect producing an album that feels like an instant classic from start to finish. But, as amazing as it is to say, it is not the the high musical quality alone that makes this album a classic. It is the intensely purposeful, intelligently biting, and all-around faithful message being screamed into our consciousness that makes Extremist far and away the head of the pack for album of the year so far.The rosetta stone to understanding Extremist is found both in the title of the album and in the song &#8220;Gasoline.&#8221; Without the framework these two create, it is very possible to misinterpret the band&#8217;s biting point (which I started to do in an earlier version of this review). The title lets you know right from the start that we are dealing not just with an extreme topic or idea, but an extremist&#8230; that is, a person who is sold out beyond the hordes and masses to something. Just what this extreme devotion is to becomes the backdrop that sets the tone of the album.It wasn&#8217;t until I really let &#8220;Gasoline&#8221; sink down into me (yep, read that with both meanings), however, that I &#8220;got&#8221; what I feel Ryan is truly saying. In &#8220;Gasoline&#8221; Ryan paints the picture of feigning apology to someone who has been, in the past, offended by the band&#8217;s extreme stances on faith, life, death, devotion, and the like. Here Ryan bellows, &#8220;I thought about you&#8230; let me ease away the painful words I wrote, we can smother out the flames within my soul, no more standing by the way that I believe&#8230;&#8221; In this, he gives an ear to those who have claimed the band is too extreme in their faith, their music, and etc. However, it is the next line that sets the tone through which the album as a whole should be viewed. In feigning concern for those who would say that he has been either too devoted or not devoted enough to his beliefs he screams, &#8220;we can smother out the flames WITH GASOLINE&#8221; (All caps for the change from somber singing to brutal screaming).Of course, gasoline on fire doesn&#8217;t put things out&#8230; it makes it even more extreme. And that is the point. Ryan is saying, in effect, &#8220;listen, I&#8217;m not backing down. You want me to water it down, tone it down, and I&#8217;m telling you things only get more extreme from here.&#8221; This antagonistic tone is felt throughout the album and if one were to miss it, you could VERY easily misinterpret other songs on the album if taken individually.Album Breakdown: Extremist begins with a classic DH jam in &#8220;Death.&#8221; In our exclusive Demon Hunter Week questions (see main page of site each day this week), Ryan says that he wishes more bands would quit following what&#8217;s trendy and just write more songs about death. This album certainly takes that advice. In fact, it begins and ends with a counter-argument format. At the outset we see the defeated enemy of death asking foolish man &#8220;just who do you think I am?&#8221; This points to the fact that we seem to take death as if it is a positive thing and/or our the ultimate solution. In this Clark (as death) proclaims, &#8220;I&#8217;m not your hope&#8230; I&#8217;m not your paragon of justice&#8230;&#8221; This is directly countered by the closing track &#8220;The Heart of a Graveyard&#8221; (skip down to the explanation on it if you wish before moving on).&#8220;Artificial Light,&#8221; the first single and most likely to sit on Demon Hunter&#8217;s Greatest Hits album of the future, moves from death to the idea of false prophets, teachers, hopes, etc. In this, the song is pretty straightforward. Lyrics like, &#8220;we want a real cure, not idle sympathy&#8221; coupled with the overall message of the album give this song a familiarity to tracks like &#8220;Sixteen.&#8221; Ryan states in his &#8220;About Artificial Light&#8221; video that this is related back to lyrics in metal that pose the problem, but don&#8217;t really offer any hope.&#8220;What I&#8217;m Not&#8221; brings the first real flavoring of European metal influences to the mix, though the track is still mostly classic DH in style. In this track, Ryan defines what he/the band is by pointing to what they are distinctly not. &#8220;Every idol I refuse, every declaration, becoming what I&#8217;m not.&#8221; This is a great song through and through with an amazing guitar solo that is simply classic metal at its finest.&#8220;The Last One Alive&#8221; is the first anthemic track that begins another thread weaved through the album of asking if &#8220;I&#8217;m the only one still standing in this extreme faith/trust/hope.&#8221; The song begins by asking, &#8220;Does anyone still try? Does anyone still hope to set their eyes beyond this place where angels fall and darkness reigns, where time dissolves the brightest flames?&#8221; The song brings a heavy charge against a world who allows the troubles and times to choke the light from their midst. However, it also offers a hope in/through/for the remnant as it proclaims &#8220;this is where we find the only hope within this place&#8230;&#8221; Though Christ is not specifically pointed to with a direct finger, DH weaves His name through the underpinnings of the tapestry in a way that, especially knowing their faith, He is hard to ignore as that &#8220;only hope.&#8221; This song also features another great guitar spot that will keep purists in awe.&#8220;I Will Fail You&#8221; takes the message behind &#8220;A Thread of Light&#8221; and gives it an antagonistic spin. This furthers that &#8220;extremist&#8221; angle nicely while making a statement that if &#8220;you&#8221; are looking for the band to water it down, tone it down, change, be less outspoken&#8230; then, &#8220;I will fail you, of this I&#8217;m sure&#8230; I will fail you to the core.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure this song will be popular as a beacon of ire to those that the track is speaking directly to. Of course, there is also the surface meaning that in any relationship, you will fail the person at some point, and dealing with that reality. If you watch no other video from Ryan&#8217;s series of explanation videos, watch I Will Fail You, as it&#8217;s weight is felt across the album as a whole and the entire Extremist theme.&#8220;One Last Song&#8221; picks up the remnant theme from &#8220;The Last One Alive.&#8221; &#8220;There is a fire in me. I feel it burn within my chest. Returning back with every vacancy of breath&#8230; One last song to sing&#8230; this everlasting Word inside me&#8230;&#8221; Like the other &#8220;last&#8221; themed track, this is a great anthemic track that inspires action&#8230; though the point of it seems to be that with each song Ryan sings he may be facing his last chance to make a difference in the world for that listener at that time. The effect goes back to the &#8220;extremist&#8221; theme that if he only gets one song, he&#8217;s going to make it count and forget about all the detractors who want it watered down.Speaking of those detractors&#8230; there is no other way to approach &#8220;Cross to Bear&#8221; than to see it as a railing against those who nit-pick the band and bemoan them at every other turn. This song follows the heart of &#8220;I Will Fail You,&#8221; but turns its ire up to eleven. I haven&#8217;t found any better words to describe the track than to say that it is the most pissed off Demon Hunter song ever. I mean, &#8220;Sixteen&#8221; didn&#8217;t really mince words, but even it didn&#8217;t proclaim repeatedly that &#8220;not one of you bastards has a cross to bear.&#8221; As we talked with Ryan (see our exclusive Demon Hunter Week content), he mentioned about how each album people say that the cover is &#8220;more evil&#8221; even though they&#8217;ve used a spin on the exact same image every time&#8230; or how them using red gels to saturate a band picture in that hue proves that they are in service to the enemy&#8230; well, this is their answer to that&#8230; and it won&#8217;t make those same people the song is written against big fans in the process&#8230; nor was it meant to.&#8220;Hell Don&#8217;t Need Me&#8221; is unique in the fact that it almost works as a southern rock track. Extremist was produced by the same guy who has worked heavily with The Showdown in the past and this is where that shows the most. From the lyrics, to the musical landscape, to that intangible tone of the song everything almost seems to have a &#8220;down south&#8221; feel to it. This song (unless I&#8217;m way off base) speaks antagonistically towards the person who feels like they&#8217;re &#8220;good enough&#8221; and so &#8220;hell don&#8217;t need me.&#8221; This is spoken directly against, again, in the closing track. The line &#8220;the water will decide where to feed me. Mother don&#8217;t you cry, hell don&#8217;t need me,&#8221; speaks to this &#8220;let the chips fall where they may&#8221; &#8220;go with the flow&#8221; attitude that many have to eternity.&#8220;In Time&#8221; returns once again to the remnant theme, brining a hopeful answer to the question, &#8220;Am I the only one left?&#8221; This song serves to uplift and empower the &#8220;extremists&#8221; by saying, &#8220;in time we will erase it all&#8230; we are the fault of our own fall&#8230; but the faithful are not alone.&#8221; It is not quite as bold and empowering as, say, &#8220;Undying,&#8221; or &#8220;Not Ready to Die,&#8221; in tone&#8230; but it does a great job of taking the bullets of the world (and the detractors from within that are spoken against), wearing them on the sleeve, and saying, &#8220;we got this, kid.&#8221; In the end, Ryan is lifting his hand high and saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let them tear it from your hands,&#8221; because we won&#8217;t let them tear it from ours.&#8220;Beyond Me&#8221; follows &#8220;Hell Don&#8217;t Need Me&#8221; in painting the picture of a person who &#8220;trusts in the powerless, the ever-knowing inside, see no deliverance, leave all conviction behind.&#8221; This is the &#8220;chest-less man&#8221; C. S. Lewis spoke of in The Abolition of Man. Ryan questions this person, &#8220;Where does your allegiance lie?&#8221; as he also says that all they will find is a &#8220;lonely hope&#8221; as a &#8220;nameless soul&#8230; dying to be whole.&#8221;Again, &#8220;Gasoline&#8221; is the rosetta stone for comprehending this album as a whole, and it is a simply fantastic song from start to finish, as well. However, since we&#8217;ve already outlined it, allow me to move on to the closing track. &#8220;The Heart of a Graveyard&#8221; is not only a counterpoint to the opening track &#8220;Death,&#8221; but to the attitude highlighted in songs like &#8220;Hell Don&#8217;t Need Me.&#8221; DH paints the picture of a lonely grave with an empty hope as they proclaim, &#8220;tell me that your final home is not a shot in the dark. Tell me that your hopes and dreams don&#8217;t end in the heart of a graveyard.&#8221; While this track isn&#8217;t the uplifting piece that &#8220;Undying&#8221; or &#8220;Storm the Gates of Hell&#8221; were, it is more relatable and challenging. With any attention to details, the listener should walk away asking themselves what their eternity really looks like, where they are going, and whether or not they are willing to be extreme for what they believe.Musicianship: I do not hesitate to say that in terms of the music alone, this is Demon Hunter&#8217;s best album. It is &#8220;classic&#8221; both in the sense of the style that Demon Hunter has evolved over the years and in the sense of simply classical metal. The light European stylings and heavy doom metal influence blend together with their signature riffs to create something that finally rivals their &#8220;golden age&#8221; of Summer of Darkness, The Triptych, and Storm the Gates of Hell.Lyrical/Spiritual Content: This is Demon Hunter&#8217;s most aggressive album lyrically ever. It is also their most purposeful. Each track took several listens to really get what was going on, and when I (think I) did get what was being said, deep waters were found. I&#8217;ve outlined the deep message above and, therefore, will not repeat it here. The way that Ryan weaves the elements of being an extremist, unapologetic for this stance, and plays with the expectations of the &#8220;norms&#8221; of the world is great. If I were one of those nit-picky people railed against in &#8220;Cross to Bear,&#8221; I&#8217;d say I wish there were a little more direct ending pointed to Jesus Himself. That said, the point was to bring up the right questions and give the listener a desire to search than to take their hand and force them into what the band sees as the Right Answer (though the allusions are more than strong enough that you get the point).Lasting Value: With any piece of artwork there is a question as to how it will stand the test of time. For example, many still hold Summer of Darkness as the paragon of what Demon Hunter have to offer all these years later. Extremist will stand the test of time. It is a classic album that deserves to sit in stores (or whatever we have in the future) alongside any classic metal album still chugging along since the 70&#8242;s and beyond. This album deserves to earn the band new fans as it gets heavily replayed into the next several decades. Yep, it&#8217;s that well done.Overall: Demon Hunter is back with a dynamic album that blends classical and European metal stylings into their already distinct sound. The effect is an album that is at once familiar and perpetually new. Ryan Clark, songwriter and singer, has claimed publicly that this is the single most purposefully made DH album to date. I can&#8217;t disagree with him. Extremist weaves a powerful tale that at once decries expectations and yet sets the bar for any album that comes after it. This is Demon Hunter at their best and it should make waves in the musical world upon its release just as it makes waves in people&#8217;s souls that cause them to question what lies beyond this place &#8220;where angels fall and darkness reigns.&#8221;RIYL: Living Sacrifice, Doom Metal, Any Demon Hunter album so far"
A1XO215OTTYNA6,B00HX0XOBW,5.0,"This CD is just great! Though I believe a lot of the long-time fans or the fans that like to complain a lot don't care much for this CD, but I LOVE it! And seeing how I've been a fan of this band since The World Is a Thorn came out.Anyway, here a Song-by-Song ranking of each of the songs (1 being the lowest; 10 being the highest):Death: 10/10, an AWESOME opening song for this album! It is also one of the BEST songs on this album despite how short it was!Artifcial Light: 10/10, this song is just amazing! Ryan does a great job on screaming and singing in this song, and I don't normally like it when bands do that, so since that I like it here it makes all that much more awesome!What I'm Not: 8/10, it's a good song, but it feels incomplete to me, but, what do I know?The Last One Alive: 9/10, I like this song a lot, but isn't one of the best, but still a great song to listen to.I Will Fail You: 10/10, darkest song on this whole album, and it is probably the second best song on this album!One Last Song: 6, the song is good, but it feels like a filler; it is still a good song though!Cross To Bear: 12/10: BEST. SONG. ON. THE. ALBUM!Hell Don't Need Me: 9/10, great song! I listen to this a lot! It also has more of a nu-metal feel to it, which is still awesome!In Time: 8/10, Awesome song! Though it feels like a filler, but it is still one heck of a great song!Beyond Me: 10/10, amazing song! Very unique sonding!Gasoline: 10/10, AMAZING! It reminds me a lot of one of their previous songs called &#34;I Play Dead&#34; but he only scream one word insted of a sentence.The Heart Of A Graveyard: 10/10, probably the most pop sounding song Demon Hunter has made but still doesn't fail to meet my expectaions!And if you do not have this album, then don't waste anymore time, buy this album NOW!"
AHXV0MLVGZM3J,B00HX0XOBW,5.0,"I loved, and still love True Defiance, and had a hard time believing Demon Hunter could top it. After all it was so Brutal and Heavy. I loved Artificial Light when I heard it, and liked Last one Alive but then was kind of disappointed by I will fail you. Not that I will fail you is a bad song, it's just that each song released got softer and softer and I was worried their would not be that many heavy songs on this album. Not to worry though their is plenty of heaviness on this album and it has a great flow to it. Each song is well played quality metal!!!!!! My favorite songs are Artificial Light, What I'm Not, One Last Song, Cross To bear, In Time, Beyond Me and my Favorite hands down is Gasoline which is Awesome!!!!!!! Heart of a Graveyard is good too with a sweeet mix of melody and heavy. The Album has a great flow to it from start to finish and there is no song that is not good. You can listen all the way through and be satisfied with everything on tap. I shouldn't have worried after all this is Demon Hunter and they are Awesome!!!!! Does it top True Defiance I don't know. All I know is that Gasoline is one of my new favorite songs, and  it would sound good played between Someone to Hate, and Cross To Bear followed by Crucifix. If you love Metal get both Extremist and True Defiance!!!!!!"
A31R3K4EWYC1LD,B00HX0XOBW,4.0,"I've been a fan of DH since their first album back in 2002 and was even looking forward to the band back when they were all mysterious and trying not to let people know who their identities were but the rumors went around fast that they were a super group of former Christian band artists from various projects.  Demon Hunter blew me away with their self-titled release.  They had early signs that they were capable of blending heavy/brutal metal with some powerful, emotional and softer guitar riffs or acoustic ballads early on, so this album (sadly) comes as no surprise as the band takes a mellow, natural turn into territory they've been creeping into over the years on previous albums with fewer heavier songs and more lighter/radio-friendly ballad songs.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed Extremist (their 7th studio release to date), but don't expect the Demon Hunter frojm the first couple of albums. Expect the Demon Hunter from the last few albums but with even less metal. It's not a total loss, however, as they manage to pound out a couple of bangers here and there (Cross to Bear being the heaviest/in-your-face song on the album), and Demon Hunter can mix the heavy with the melodic very well, so while there's a lot more if it- it's not terrible.The style on some songs (Heart of a Graveyard) has some HIM influence or sound, and the level of emotion in this album seems to be more real than ever; songs like I Will Fail You and The Last One Alive showcase Ryan Clark's ability to write lyrics that are not only artistic and poetic but down to earth and identifiable to Christian believers/fans while also being common enough to be understood by non-believers as well without being &#34;preachy&#34;.The album, Extremist, is titled so with a concept that Christians in society today are being labeled more and more as bigots, close-minded, hate-filled, right-wing radicals or &#34;extremists&#34; for their views on social hot button issues that liberal/progressive society is leaning further towards every day. The message of the Bible is clear, and to me, Clark is speaking of not compromising in the face of this adversity since the direction of society in it's humanistic views is obviously not making room for Christianity even though &#34;tolerance&#34; is a two way street (The Last One Alive).  Christians are being labeled and targeted more and more and its becoming next to impossible to express your 1st amendment right to religion without repercussions of losing a job, being slandered in the media or bullied, so it's easy to see a society where Christianity becomes illegal & &#34;archaic&#34; with believers being persecuted, imprisoned and executed like in third world countries where socisalism & communism reigns & any religious freedom beyond what the govt. dictates is punishable without a trial or defense.I love how bold DH is on this subject, as they have always been real and up front on their religious beliefs and how they view being examples to fans and inspiring people through their message in the songs they produce, while also being humble and acknowledging their human being sinners at the same time (I Will Fail You).I'm personally disappointed that they are becoming more mellow in their style, but I'm still enjoying it, so I can't complain. It's been a great ride so far on the DH express- lots of great songs over the years!"
AOO0BGPMM50GW,B00HX5PQ36,5.0,"I have all of The Used's albums and I was skeptical seeing as how Vulnerable was easily their weakest and I was underwhelmed by Artwork. I bought this album along with 2 others (bands undisclosed) and I was blown-away by this LP and kept it spinning while I ignoring the other 2. Some fans may argue that it is a tad overproduced and I can see that with every song showing its glossy finish. However, Vulnerable was underproduced and veteran artists need to include extra sounds/attention to detail to grab ears. Also, many may argue that their first LP is still their best. Okay, I can see that but also the music scene was very different then. Their first album was well-timed (along with Story Of The Year's first LP) with Emo being en vogue and their screamo-tinged LP fight right in with the music scene. 6 albums in, they are not afraid to redefine their sound and Imaginary Enemy shows that......a glossy, well-polished, piece of work that stands as their most-refined effort to date. Now, if you're expecting another album like their debut, you won't get it. But, if you're willing to accept change like Lies for Liars, then give it a spin......you won't be disappointed! Fave song has to be Make Believe."
A3K7E5BISIR32G,B00HY8PXPI,5.0,"My first album of theres and listen to it daily. This one let me to ON THE WATER, an earlier one I also purchased. Such a breath of fresh air, this band is! Am falling in love with synth (for the first time for this 'older' woman) music and with Mr. Herring's poetry and high drama voice. And, one just has to dance when it's being played. Ya gotta! Every song will become a winner even if one or two don't start out that way. Love this entire album."
A1R2IX2BU7Y5E6,B00HYCINKQ,5.0,I really liked this album and would recomend it highly to anyone who likes old timey music and the Carter Family.
A2M3IJUUNQMKF9,B00HYFGSPU,5.0,"&#34;Everyday Robots&#34; is definitely one of those albums that you have to give time to grow on you. Little by little, I realized that it's a beautiful piece of work. Right from the opening track, starting with that Lord Buckley sample that seems eerily fitting for the album, Damon takes the listener on a personal, quiet journey. You can get lost in every song. Along with the songs themselves, I love the transition from &#34;Lonely Press Play&#34; to the only upbeat track, &#34;Mr. Tembo&#34; (as out of place as it is with the somber tone of the rest of the album, I still love it and I'm glad it was included). The brilliant centerpiece &#34;You and Me&#34;, the spacey-sounding &#34;Photographs (You Are Taking Now)&#34;, the melancholic &#34;The Selfish Giant&#34;, and the slightly optimistic &#34;Heavy Seas of Love&#34; are a few of my favorites, but I recommend listening to the album from start to finish. If you give it time, I hope you'll discover what's so special about it. If you liked &#34;13&#34; and &#34;Think Tank&#34; by Blur and the ballads on &#34;Plastic Beach&#34; by Gorillaz, then odds are you'll be able to appreciate this."
A23L9JDJ0IUL4G,B00HYFGSPU,5.0,"Damon remains as melodic as ever. It is indeed,  not Gorillaz, not Blur, it is Damon Albarn. His voice still has that soothing timbre, that makes you relax and just flow with the lyrics.It is a fantastic album,  if you like his past works with Gorillaz, and Blur, then you will relish your time listening to this album."
A2TNW80IC91QHH,B00HYFGSPU,4.0,"Everything on Damon Albarn's first solo album* falls into two categories: Sparse, Melodic and Morose, and Sparse, Melodic and Jubilant.Mostly the former.Because of the abundance of the morose though, the few jubilant tracks like &#34;Mr. Tembo&#34;, &#34;Parakeet&#34; and &#34;Heavy Seas of Love&#34; shine more brightly; chrome wet with rain and reflecting sunlight.Almost every track has an interesting bit of percussion or scrap of texture that makes the whole work stand out and keep things compelling.Which should go without saying, I mean, this is Damon Albarn, an artist who, in my opinion, should be spoken of in the same breath as Thom Yorke and Trent Reznor with regards to his accomplishments and contributions to modern music, and his experimental heart. In fact, I might go as far as saying that, of those three, Albarn is the boldest, the one who takes the most risks.There are times when Albarn's message, that we're all isolated from one another by the technology that was originally designed to bring us closer to one another, gets a bit belabored, like on the title track,&#34;Hollow Ponds&#34; and &#34;You & Me&#34;, but it's done in a way that doesn't really feel overbearing, although my personal jury is still out when it comes to artists using technology to condemn technology.I mean, do you own an iPhone, Damon? Did you jot the lyrics about how awful phones are (&#34;we are everyday robots on our phones&#34;) on your iPhone? Didn't you shoot two of the videos for the album on one of these demonic telephonic contraptions?To be fair, he does take a moment here and there to extol the virtues of technology, on &#34;Lonely Press Play&#34;, for instance, so I guess he's not wholeheartedly vilifying technology?Or, is he making a statement by using technology to expound upon the evils of technology?Or should we care?Ah.There's the real question.Let's focus on, you know, the music, rather than the messages that might, or might not, be in the music.Shall we?Yes.One of my favorite devices on Robots is the continuity. I love me some continuity, and this album is rife with it; the whole thing ebbs and flows just like the oceans we see in Albarn's videos.Tracks that reflect the most of that wet sunlight include &#34;You & Me&#34;, which has a wonderful, sorrowful evolution, &#34;The History Of A Cheating Heart&#34;, which is just a bar of pure, sad gold, and &#34;Hollow Ponds&#34;, the beeping, grinding, Haunted Mansion distortion on which really sums up Albarn's thoughts on the plague of technology in our society better than any lyrics on here.As much as Albarn's beating a dead horse a bit with the whole &#34;technology is bad&#34; thing, the album certainly succeeds in making me feel spiteful towards technology, in making me feel disconnected from the people walking in droves around me, heads lowered in worship of and enthralled by their little screens.The album closes perfectly with the jolly (yet still kind of morose) &#34;Heavy Seas of Love&#34;, featuring Brian Eno on vocals sounding like Baloo from The Jungle Book.Which I like.People. If you enjoy Blur or Gorillaz or Rocket Juice and The Moon or The Good, The Bad & The Queen or Mali Music or any of Damon Albarn's myriad musical endeavors, just go get this. It's the core of what makes Damon Albarn Damon Albarn, and you're going to like it.You're also going to be a hypocrite if you listen to it on an iPhone or any other device utilizing electricity as a power source.* Not really counting Dr. Dee or Monkey."
A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B00HYGTVOO,5.0,"No doubt Jack Bruce is best known as the vocalist and bassist in Cream. But his strongest time was perhaps in the first half of the 70s. Producing an unsurpassed trilogy of strong solo-albums (&#34;Songs For A Tailor&#34;, &#34;Harmony Row&#34;, &#34;Out Of The Storm&#34;) and playing on groundbreaking albums like Carla Bley's &#34;Escalator Over The Hill&#34; and &#34;Turn It Over&#34; (Tony William's Lifetime).Since those golden days Jack has certainly continued making music of the highest calliber without quite reaching the same heights. So it's nice to be able to say that here at 70 he has made a strong musical statement, despite some serious health problems due to a near fatal liver transplantant in 2003.Jack has always been a restless soul and a true multitasking musician. Not only a groundbreaking bass virtuoso but also an excellent keyboardplayer. And having one of the finest voices in contemporary music. A searching musical mind mastering almost all genres from avantgarde to heavy rock. True to form with &#34;Silver Rails&#34; he has made yet another diverse outing, helped by friends like Uli Jon Roth, Robin Trower, Cindy Blackman Santana, John Medeski a.m.o.. Although the backbone of the album is the musicians from his Big Blues Band like Tony Remy on guitar and drummer Frank Tontoh. We also find Jack reunited with long time partner lyricist Pete Brown who has delivered yet another set of poignant words. An album consisting of 8 new tracks of ususal high standard plus two 'oldies': &#34;Keep It Down&#34; (&#34;Out Of The Storm&#34;) and &#34;No Surrender&#34; (&#34;A Question Of Time&#34;).Despite being only 30 min.s long the bonus DVD - directed by Jack's daughter Kyla Bruce - gives a rather in-deep portrait of the proceedings. With short interview clips with many of the collaborators and also paints a nice picture of Jack the free spirit. Containing some interesting 'facts'. like &#34;Rusty Lady&#34; is about Margaret Thatcher (&#34;Winston in drag without the cigar&#34;) and that the bass-drum track &#34;Drone&#34; was inspired by the band Om.How time will judge this album compared to the masterworks of his younger days who knows? But he certainly shows - like recent releases by Paul McCartney, David Crosby, John McLaughlin- that there is indeed still life and creativity beyond the 70."
A20722M7YHUHFD,B00HYQ5AQ2,5.0,"That's right, I said it. Even though SA has released five albums since Winterheart's Guild (the end of the &#34;classic&#34; SA era, in my opinion), this newest release is the most well-rounded, pleasurable SA album I've heard in a while. Unia, Days of Grays, while good albums overall, they were a little too dark for SA....SGHN was a step in the right direction. While overall the sound was still pretty varied, it was overall a lighter album.Now we come to Pariah's Child. This album takes some elements of the old SA power/speed metal era, combining it with their more recent progressive-sounding efforts, and throw a few coats of fun over it all. The album starts out right with The Wolves Die Young, a great first single off the album and a great way to kick off them album. It segues right into the next song, Running Lights, which is good ol' speedy SA. Moving forward with Cloud Factory, the album just continues to be a good mix of high energy, melody, and...well, more melody! The themes are not as dark, the music not as &#34;deep&#34; and introspective, but still engaging enough that you'll really grab onto the hooks.Personally, I loved the album overall, already listened to it four times in the past week (and it's rare for me to listen to the same album twice in the first three months of its release!). As long as SA keeps up their progressive sound mixed with their impeccable penchant for melody and FUN, then the next album will be just as good."
A1GLM8UVJ031VY,B00HYQ5AQ2,4.0,"After the first couple of spins of Pariah's Child I had to ask myself a question: \"Why don't I like this album?\"  With a couple more spins I realize that, in fact, I do like it.  Nonetheless, for my taste it has some weaknesses.Since I do like the work, let's get the things that troubled me off the list early.  This album is dominated by the lyrics.  The instrumental work has been mixed somewhat lower than in most metallic music, while the words to the songs are of primary importance.  The result is that initially I overlooked the musical brilliance I had come to expect from SA.  It is often there, it's just deeper in the mix.  The second problem for me was the overuse of sound effects, voiceovers, and other gimmicks.  Some might like that, but here I found it sometimes to be a cover for tedious music (*cough* Cloud Factory, X Marks the Spot).  Finally, there were a couple of songs here that were basically good, but had drum parts that could have been created by Meg White (Half a Marathon Man).  Portimo is a terrific drummer - I have come to expect more from his parts.Fortunately, that is not the whole story.  On careful listening, the album often does have the very clever use of time and key signatures that I have always loved in Sonata Arctica - a 4/4 verse with a waltz chorus in the The Wolves Die Young; a delightful 5/4 passage in Take One Breath...  The musicians are playing, for the most part, as well as they ever have.  Kakko's vocals are outstanding as always, albeit a little too high in the mix for my own taste.  This is the SA we all know and love - it's just that it is easy to overlook the fact in all the jokes and sound effects.I like this album more every time I listen.  I deducted a star because I have to hit the \"skip\" button every time X Marks the Spot comes up, but on the whole it is solid work from a mature band.  Long-time SA fans will need it, but if you are new to their work, start with a different album.Edit: After a couple more listens I have realized that the drum work on \"...Marathon Man\" is intentionally monotonous - it mimics the pounding of a runner's feet on the pavement, hour after hour.  As usual... clever."
ALAJL3S09HBS7,B00HZ03P0K,1.0,"John \"Seymour\" Butt has been proscribed by the Australian Knappertsbusch Association. Really: this guy gets airtime because he makes recordings at a cost of fifty bucks and a slab of beers thrown in for good measure. A Wanted Poster has been issued. There's a price of ten dollars on his head. Bangkok Betty is willing to do her bit: catch the bugger and you'll receive a Maximum Stress Relief Session at discount.This performance of the Requiem is more abominable than alternatives from Sir Woger of Norrington and Jordi Savall; therefore, it's the worst on the market. It's one of the few times when I have thought: can this guy actually conduct? The text of the Requiem, from the Sequence itself to the liturgical prescriptions, encompasses a range of emotions. How does Butt respond? Answer: loud, semi-loud, very loud. The homogeneity across all movements is astounding. There is no feel whatsoever for the text - perhaps Butt did not bother to consult a translation or cannot read Ecclesiastical Latin. Needless to say, this performance is as elegiac and reverential as Black Sabbath. Listen to the close of the Requiem Aeternam (from \"et lux perpetua luceat eis\") or the Confutatis (from \"Oro supplex et acclinis\") - here we go gathering nuts in May!The soloists are more pedestrian than the cover of Abbey Road. The soprano, in her lack of lustre and projection, should go back to the chorus (thereby doubling its head-count). Vibrato is minimal - in the lower reaches of the Tuba Mirum, the inadequacies of the bass are sadly exposed.Joy of joys, the strings of the Dunedin Consort might appeal to vinegar-lovers and that's about. Crudities abound. When one longs for the Academy of Ancient Music or Jeggy's English Baroque Soloists, is it time to complain. The scrappy passagework in the Hostias and Bendictus made my cat Norman W Lambchops leave the room - meow.I read the other reviews of this offal with despair. We live in end times. Nothing more can be eked out. Oh, for barbarians at the gates but they're long overdue and perhaps nothing more than a memory."
A1YLYAF8ES98UZ,B00HZ9ASMY,5.0,hadn't heard of the band until Amazon recommended it.  it's solid end-to-end.  one of the best finds so far in 2014.
A1Q3ZJGN3FYKOV,B00HZJH9BC,4.0,"Been a long time fan of The Hold Steady and was really looking forward to this record. I wasn't too impressed with first single \"I Hope This Whole Thing Didn't Frighten You\" and not thrilled about \"Spinners\". By the third track \"The Only Thing\", I had found the Hold Steady I know and love. One thing was nagging me though,the SOUND. I'm reminded of a remark that was made many years ago about an old J. Geils Band live album. I think it was \"Showtime.\" It applies here. The drums sound like he's beating on cardboard boxes. Also, on what I believe to be Craig Finn's most beautiful song ever,there is his voice WAY OFF in the distance when I think the song would have been even more powerful had his great vocal performance been a lot CLOSER TO THE EAR. I'm talking about \"Almost Everything\". I still enjoyed this album very much but for some reason I kept thinking about mud."
A9ZZETOT35J1C,B00HZMRVXA,5.0,"Classic Don Williams.  His voice is still mellow and the songs still genuine. The songs have the same vibe as his early work, and yet they still sound fresh. I particularly like &#34;Stronger Back.&#34; Very easy album to listen to."
A2HTF88O2QYO7D,B00HZMRVXA,5.0,"\"Reflections\" is the new album by now 74-year-old Don \"Gentle Giant\" Williams, the follow-up to his 2012 album \"And So It Goes.\" The tracks on this album are not originals but classic tunes from other great songwriters. What is immediately obvious when you start playing this album, is that his smooth bass-baritone, one of the most iconic voices of country music, has lost none of its power to mesmerize the listener with these reflections on a life well-lived.The songs covered on this album are, as performed by the original artists: \"I'll Be Here In The Morning\" (Townes Van Zandt), \"Talk Is Cheap\" (Alan Jackson), \"I Won't Give Up On You\" (Jordyn Shellhart), \"Sing Me Back Home\" (Merle Haggard), \"Working Man's Son\" (??), \"Healing Hands\" (Steve Gillette), \"If I Were Free\" (Jesse Winchester), \"Back To The Simple Things\" (??), \"Stronger Back\" (Doug Gill) and \"The Answer\" (??). Sadly, for the songs marked (??), I couldn't find the names of the original artists.Quality oozes from this album like filling from one of America's best, home-made burgers. The ten songs, carefully produced by Garth Fundis, show that the veteran singer picked ten golden musical nuggets out of the country music catalog, putting together a compilation of beautiful authentic country tracks. Songs like the folksy \"I'll Be Here In The Morning,\" the romantic \"Working Man's Son,\" the tugging-at-your-heartstrings \"Sing Me Back Home\" or the somewhat snappier \"Talk Is Cheap\" are exemplary for this. Ever the sensitive story-teller, with the easy, almost conversational musical style in which he sings, he manages to touch the soul of the listener with every intonation.Don Williams is truly gifted as a singer and the way he interprets these classics lifts this album way above it being \"just a cover cd.\" Personal favorites on this album are \"I'll Be Here In The Morning,\" \"I Won't Give Up On You,\" \"Sing Me Back Home\" and \"Healing Hands.\" In less than a month, we were blessed by the outstanding, but alas posthumous Johnny Cash album \"Out Among The Stars,\" and now \"Reflections\" by living legend Don Williams. Highly recommended!Unfortunately, the bare-bones cardboard CD sleeve provides only the song-titles and the names of those who wrote the music and/or lyrics.  No booklet is provided with the lyrics of the songs and their histories, or info about the original artists. For those interested, I've put this in the comment-section. For the songs marked with (??), I couldn't find the names of the original artists who sang these songs, even when using The Encyclopedia Of Country Music, Wikipedia and/or googling the internet. So if anyone can provide them so I can edit this into the review, it would be much appreciated."
A35G78YEG44JWN,B00HZMRVXA,5.0,"I have every Don Williams album he has made.  There is not one album I do not like and this album is no exception.  Mr. Williams delivers hope, sincerity, and a passion for life with these beautifully written songs.  With his amazing voice he is able to pull you into the words so you to can &#34;reflect&#34; on life."
A3GD5JYLI2WZG0,B00HZMRVXA,4.0,"Although this is an excellent album, the selections are new for Don Williams and I prefer the old Don Williams classics.  So I like thre album, but would rather hear the classics--over and over again."
A10K698DATXQ44,B00HZMRVXA,4.0,"Musically speaking, Don Williams and I go back quite a few years.  as usual, his performance on this album is superb.  the gentleness of his voice and the softness of the music is hard to find these days.  the background music never overshadows the performer; every word is clear and softly delivered.  if you're a country music fan and have not &#34;discovered&#34; Don Williams it's time to do so.  A good start would be &#34;Reflections.&#34;  Thanks Don for not retiring!"
A3GJW1JRKN8W8T,B00HZMS1F2,5.0,"I was admittedly cautious, yet optimistic, when I pre-ordered this album. But a few songs in, no regrets! This album is amazing.  This is the real deal.  Really."
A3J7CP9EWFNTSK,B00HZMS1F2,4.0,"As I said love these guys since an old friend turned me on to them years ago, I mostly like straight ah aid metal and industrial but as far as this goes it's better now that they control there own ,it's just most people think everything should be like transformer or evolver. But we all get older,and a bit wiser I guess. It would be nice though if these dudes did a more rock and roll type lp. Let Mahoney play a bit more. It seems I don't hear his little riffs that much anymore or as much, same with peanut. They must be chilling to to much DMB? Get back to there smoking daze."
A2O801TWAJ5YM6,B00HZOBBM0,3.0,"Coming off what I feel is their best (the 30th anniversary XXX) I didn't expect this one to be as good but they have pulled off another very ear-pleasing and tuneful set.  Steve Howe's guitar is missed; Sam Coulson is a fabulous player technically but Steve's distinct sound really took the songs to another level and did offset the sometimes generic feel of Asia's songwriting which is only enhanced a bit by the faceless guitar work.  Energy levels are definitely a step down in comparison to the previous album and it does take a listen or two to get into fully. Regardless another very worthwhile collection and better than what is to be expected from most groups who have been around as long.  The bombastic synth-heavy 80's sound is in full force.  Stacks of keys, layered vocal harmonies, and slick 80's style hard rock guitar dominate the sound.  And dang, Carl Palmer is a beast and still at the top of his game.  These guys haven't changed a bit and have a strong grasp on what they do best.  Highlights are the opening track &#34;Valkyrie,&#34;  the epic &#34;Gravitas,&#34; the insanely catchy &#34;Heaven Help Me Now&#34; and the campfire acoustic tune &#34;Till We Meet Again&#34; which closes the album."
A39XWUVNZDMDYD,B00HZOBBM0,5.0,"I am thrilled with this release. I am also grateful to have four new albums in six years. Keep going strong guys. I was 19 when Heat of the Moment reminded me of my place in 1982. After all these years, my love for this band is stronger than ever. I stayed with them through the JP years - of which I am also a huge fan - and this latest CD is over the top. John Wetton sounds as strong as he did in 1982; Geoff Downes remains a consistent icon. Carl is still the hardest working drummer in the business. Sam is a very nice addition, and I hope he stays. Valkyrie is an instant classic. Closer I get to You, Joe DiMaggio's glove, I Would Die for You, and Till We Meet Again are my favorites. There is not one bad song on this album. The highlight for me too are the wonderful lyrics throughout. Asia just may be my favorite band of all time. Great listen! Great album cover. Great package."
A5RKDVXUOC2A9,B00HZOBBM0,4.0,"I have been a fan since the beginning in 1982. I eagerly look forward to and am thankful for each album they put out. This is a good album and if you're an Asia fan you'll like it. Although the bar has been set so high that it is always difficult for them to follow up, I am glad they still want to create new music and put it out for the fans. There are several good songs on this album: Heaven Help Us, Til We Meet Again, Valkyrie, Gravitas, Russian Dolls are my favorites. Lots of ballads on this album and if I have a complaint it would be that the guitars are so underwhelming compared to other Asia albums. I think Coulson has the talent but he is way too muted on this album. You cannot replace Steve Howe, but Sam is a talented guitarist and it would have been interesting if they would have let him show a little bit more of what he can do. I love the melodies and layers and arrangements of Asia songs and they still have the ability to make listenable music with a harder edge. Guys please keep up the good work cause I'll keep buying the music."
A3AWTG3VD3JAXZ,B00HZOBBM0,4.0,"I am a big fan of Asia- BOTH phases, ok. And I love the current reunion cycle. This album is my 2nd favorite thus far. That's saying a lot considering Steve Howe has retired from the band. The vocals are tremendous from Wetton; especially when you remember how long he has been doing this! They dominate the recording. As for the new guy on guitar, hard to say since he is barely heard on most of the disc. His contributions are very limited. Shines on the occasional solo, but those are few and far between. I believe he won't last long, perhaps a &#34;1 album wonder&#34; [like Mandy Meyers circa Astra album]. However overall, this is a really great disc. Although it's not as progressive as Phoenix, it's not as lightweight as Omega either. Chorus driven songs and thoughtful writing rule the day. Definitely worth getting. You will not be disappointed."
A3VYXFXAY73JRI,B00HZOBBM0,4.0,"More specifically, this album reminds me of Alpha tracks 3 - 11 (aka, if you took away Don't Cry and The Smile Has Left Your Eyes).  The glorious Asia sound is here for sure.  This album has a lot of lush, rich music with great arrangements.  The only downside for me is there aren't any standout songs on this album.  Nothing I need to absolutely hear again.  But it's good while it's playing."
A1FDJ2PJRJ7DK1,B00HZVX1C6,5.0,"As a fan of James Newton Howard's work (particularly &#34;Lady In The Water&#34;, &#34;Treasure Planet&#34; and his &#34;Batman Begins&#34; and &#34;Dark Knight&#34; material) I had pretty high expectations for this fantasy score. Let me tell you, Howard does not disappoint. This soundtrack even knocks &#34;The Amazing Spiderman 2&#34; by Hans Zimmer and company off its rank as my top score so far of 2014!Opening with the brooding strings and tuba of the &#34;Maleficent Suite&#34;, you immediately realize this score will be something unique and powerful. The track builds with haunting choral chants, before crescendoing in a massive burst of brass and orchestral power, letting loose with a powerful main theme that is noble without being specifically heroic (brilliantly reflective of the character of Maleficent, neither completely protagonist or antagonist). Howard then moves into some beautiful piano reflection, before closing the suite with a return to the choir. This suite essentially summarizes what one can expect from the score to come: moments of immense beauty, nobility, tenderness, but also moments of colossal orchestral power and authority.Howard's choral and string writing is a remarkable strong point, as usual. &#34;Welcome To The Moors&#34; and &#34;Maleficent Flies&#34; introduce a playful and innocent initial theme for Maleficent, a marvelous blend of the strings and choir. The music is truly transcendent at times in its beauty, sweeping one away into a land of enchantment. Often, Howard's enchantment writing will remind one of a more mature &#34;Narnia&#34; soundtrack. (Nothing against Gregson-Williams, who did fine work, but Howard definitely shines brighter here) A lovely romance theme is introduced in &#34;Prince Phillip&#34;, delicately balancing strings and woodwinds, and a marvelously enchanting theme for Aurora surfaces on &#34;Aurora In Faerieland&#34;. Again, the balance of choir and strings is near perfection. A tender rendition of Maleficent's material appears in &#34;True Love's Kiss&#34;, and the concluding score track, &#34;The Queen of Faerieland&#34; reprises themes of innocence in powerful, sweeping movements.Just as notable, however, is the sheer amount of force and energy evident in Howard's action material, and the material representing Maleficent's evil turn. Her bitterness and curse is reflected in a chilling choral chant, which appears frequently throughout the score, prominent in the &#34;Suite&#34;, &#34;The Christening&#34; and &#34;The Spindle's Power&#34;. Her evil villainous nature is represented by powerful brass blasts and explosive percussion, and the orchestra performs Howard's material with such force it is impossible not to be shaken. &#34;The Christening&#34; is remarkable for its propulsive, dark energy (and a nod to John Williams' &#34;Jaws&#34; and &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; material) and &#34;Path of Destruction&#34; is brief but potent. Action cues all announce themselves with a sense of full and powerful scale, and &#34;Maleficent Is Captured&#34; is one of the highlight action cues of the year, hammering away with percussion and brass and reprising Maleficent's theme from the suite. Music with this much creative energy and force has not been heard from Howard for quite some time, and the vibrant life of the music truly asserts itself in film and on album.I look forward to continuing to explore this score, which seems to hold a wealth of complexities I am still unaware of after multiple listens. &#34;Maleficent&#34; has most everything one could want in a truly great score: intricate themes, moments of beauty, moments of power, fantastic performances and a truly emotional and powerful heart. Certainly the best score of the year so far, and one of the best of Howard's fine career."
A10BTTULP3089I,B00HZX0IM0,5.0,I'm always a little apprehensive of &#34;superstar&#34; collaborations.  Though Wilko is not as well known as Daltry he has a large following.  This one works.  The playing is tight. Daltry's voice sounds great.  I'm really enjoying this album.  Don't expect a Dr Feelgood album.  It's a little different but every bit as satisfying in my opinion.
A33FLCA6RC7IRN,B00I0AXPCW,4.0,"This is one of Gazpachos finest albums. I bought it on vinyl and had to return my first copy due to super noisy vinyl. The second copy is slightly better, but overall pretty poor dynamics with surface noise, pops and clicks thruout. I clean all of my new vinyl when I get it on my Spin clean and this one was no different. Horrible! I have 30 yr old copies of albums that were purchased used that sound better than this! Really too bad. At least I have a 320kbps mp3 download, so I know what it is sorta supposed to sound like. Most expensive mp3 I ever bought! Stick to cd, because the music is really wonderful."
A1HCCW38EQQBTY,B00I0HNOQW,4.0,"Kelis has always been an off-kilter musical kitty to me, so when this dropped, I just bought it.  After playing 3 times, it grew on me.  She has a serious band backing her up and her vocals are clear.  The only part I didn't understand was having titles to your songs that's not heard in your lyrics.  Only two songs had the titles in the lyrics, that I heard.  Anyway, if you want some serious band music playing with strong vocals, then she's your girl."
A1NS9WO1VACAUN,B00I0HNOQW,4.0,"So when I learned that Kelis' follow-up to her club album, the incredible and under-rated, Flesh Tone, was going to be an album called Food that would help with her new direction in the world of the food network or cooking shows, I was scared.First thing that came to mind was, gimmick! OH NO!When I get a Kelis album I want to be \"blown away\" and I didn't think it would happen with this \"Food\" project. BOY WAS I WRONG!  This is a sexy, sultry, and emotive r&b; album that is both modern and classic all at once.  Perfect album  that you can play when you're getting close to your special someone.Here are my Top 10 fave songs on this album in order of most listened to:Forever BeFloydBreakfastRunnin'HoochJerk RibsCobblerBless the TelephoneChangeRumbleIf you want a solid sampling of the sounds on this album, download the first five tracks.  With that said, I don't look at this album as a singles album.  Its a cohesive project and therefore should be listened to as a whole."
A121S4HE3PUFB9,B00I0IL3AK,4.0,"I understand the disappointment from the fans who expected another typical offering from Dynazty, but can you fault the guys for evolving? I don't think so. If you D-fans want great 80's style rock than set up a Pandora channel under Dokken... or keep listening to your collection of music that's 30 years old. I'm not bashing any of you guys, I've got plenty of old cds lying around myself, but do you really want all the new bands that start up to keep turning out 'WhiteSnake' tunes?? Anyway, I was curious so I bought Bring The Thunder to give a comparative listen and while Dynazty did a good job of recreating the music of an era gone by, I think they do an even better job producing more modern, progressive melodic metal. I have more gripes about the horribly flimsy CD case than anything else. 80's style rock is what it was... let it go :) no one will ever surpass the accomplishments of Ozzy, Maiden, the Scorps, Dokken, Bon Jovi, White Snake, VH, Dream Theatre, Queensryche, Rush, TNT, Metallica, Y&T;, Def leppard, Yngwie, Dio or the Bee Gees ... ah, the 'golden years' - lol. What a great decade for music... but it's gone and time to move ahead.Upon the first couple of listens I heard things that made me wonder if Dynazty had self produced the album, and sure enough when I checked, they had. This is typically a \"no no\" (think Yngwie - yikes) unless you're Tony Harnell or Jorn, especially when such great producers like Dennis Ward are available. A good producer would have, in my opinion, reduced the number of triplet heavy songs that open the album; included a song or two of 80's style bash to appease original fan base; encouraged a pop-metal tune for fun or heavy blues throwback - something to break up the pounding triplet theme - and would have cut the amount of words used in track 6, Run Amok.  As it is, and lots of vocalists fall into this trap, the lyrical lines of Run Amok, literally run amok over a classic metal riff that's delivered rather nicely. Imagine half the words held out over twice the beats with the hook and chorus remaining the same...!  I think they really blew an opportunity to create one monster of a song. There is another track, I think 4 or 5 that I was thinking would have been really interesting if they had slowed it waaay down, adagio perhaps. But hey, they did a fine job. Come to think of it, they could have slowed the whole darn thing down just a tad to reduce the feeling of it being rushed through.What I found most interesting was the change in lyrical themes between the \"then\" and the \"now\" and wondered if the singer, Nils Molson went through some sort of religious experience? There's a lot 'redemption' and 'salvation' sung about on this album which is cool with me because I gravitate towards the positive themes; just don't start singing 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus saves...' if I want that I'll listen to Toby Mac, Britt Nicole, Matt West, or Mandisa. And on that point, having religious themes isn't such a bad thing if you include the darker side as well (think Jorn).I think this move by Dynazty is a good one. Let me ask you this, what genre ISN'T over crowded these days with bands hoping for a break. I think their chances in the progressive metal market are significantly better than waisting time as  just one more glorified 80's cover band. The talent is definitely there and with Dynazty settled in with a few new band mates they seem ready to conquer the world :) I like what they're doing. I hear similarities to Twilightning (RIP), Nocturnal Rites (8th Sin is incredible), Europe, Fire Wind and even Ayreon... holy smokes, the lead in track 3 (Dawn of Your Creation) begins in classic Michael Romeo (Sym X) style - it's smokin' !! I wanted to give a 5 star rating to up the average and encourage potential support but that wouldn't have been honest, but this album is surely worth a solid 4 stars. SO.. buy it, give the guys some support and maybe next time they'll have enough loose change lying around to hire Dennis Ward to produce them. Peace and always play it loud - B"
A1EZSNJO687Z4K,B00I0IL3AK,1.0,"If you liked the first three albums, Renatus may leave you scratching your head. There is not a single song on the album that I wanted to listen to a second time. The band changed to a heavier, more symphonic metal sound. There's lots of triplet picking and double bass. To be honest, this album sounds a lot like Silent Call could have written and performed it. All the hooks, melodies, and great riffs are gone. I am going to be dumping this one on ebay."
A3KFSSHRIFGHPJ,B00I0O9QJY,3.0,"As a big fan I want to give it a better rating but in truth this Kylie Minogue collection is just fair. The songs are written and produced by a variety of top talent, but it seems like they gave her their leftovers and then glossed the whole thing over with some europop glitz. Very disappointing."
AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B00I0O9QJY,5.0,"Kylie Minogue is in a class by herself. No one else in the pop genre even comes close to her run of great albums, starting long ago with her self-titled album and Impossible Princess, through Light Years, Fever, Body Language, X, and Aphrodite (not to mention the brilliant singles and Abbey Road remake album). The biggest fear, when she switched to the new label, was that she'd radically change her sound. The subpar single \"Skirt\" made a lot of us fans a bit nervous. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think anyone wanted an entire album of songs like that from Kylie. Fortunately, Kiss Me Once is another outstanding album, feeling like a blend of X and Aphrodite.The thing we love about Kylie is her tremendous positivity and neo-disco grooves. She's also a better singer than she's generally given credit for. That's the problem with the one real misstep on this album, which is the duet with Enrique Iglesias. It's not a bad song, but the autotune is so heavy that it seems pointless to have two talented singers in it. Their voices could have carried that song just fine and given it personality. Instead, it's a bit too robotic and doesn't have that Kylie feel.The rest of the album is pure Kylie, though. Even as she gets more explicit (three songs with \"sex\" in the title!), she's still more of a winking coquette than a sex object like so many pop stars think they have to be. Songs like \"Into the Blue,\" \"I Was Gonna Cancel,\" \"Million Miles,\" and \"If Only\" are going to be great in Kylie's live shows. The pulsating beats and great rhythms work perfectly as the kind of music Kylie does best.At this point, Kylie can only be judged against herself. She's well beyond her peers in the industry. Though I would not consider this her best (Light Years and Fever hold that honor for me, but, as I mentioned earlier, all her modern albums have been tremendous) this one stands tall amongst her releases over the past decade."
A12EJDWH8Q0ANH,B00I0O9QJY,5.0,"Kiss Me Once plays out like a mixture of Kylie's last three album &#34;Body Langauge&#34;, &#34;X&#34;, and &#34;Aphrodite&#34; it a blend out the R&B, electronica, and dance pop of the three respectively. With the results being a wonderful collection of pop-R&B songs and continuing a trend that started with the release of her 2000 album &#34;Light Years&#34;  of releasing strong cohensive alums. My favorite tracks on the album are &#34;Sexy Love&#34;, &#34;Sexercise&#34; which is a sex song that is done in a way that only Kylie can deliver one cute and polite, &#34;I Was Gonna Cancel&#34; which has Pharrell written all over it but retains the DNA of a Kylie song, and &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; which is the albums only downtempo song. The albums weakes tracks would have to be &#34;Beautifil&#34; her duet with Enrique Igelisas which would of been a lot better if it wasn't auto-tuned and the other bonus track &#34;Mr. President&#34; which on first listening sounds like utter nonsense. All a really great album."
A1ZFK81STZVU4S,B00I0O9QJY,5.0,Kylie hits us with her classic timeless bubblegum sound that we fell in love with in the 80s. A great gift for any true Kylie fan.
AC6UTDXWZTIEH,B00I0TFR4M,4.0,"This album marks 40 years in the business for Robert Cray (and long-term bass player/song writer Richard Cousins) and highlights Robert's soul/R&B; side with covers of songs by Otis Redding, Lou Rawls and Bobby `Blue' Bland. This is good news for me because I've always favoured Robert's soul output rather than his straight blues. As well as Cousins the band features returning keyboard player Dover Weinberg as well as drummer Les Falconer, who joins Robert on vocals for the fabulous version of Redding's \"Nobody's Fault but Mine\" - with its great brass lines. Robert does a really good laid-back reading of Rawls' \"Your Good Thing (Is About to End)\" and \"Deep in My Soul\" is transformed from Bland's impassioned southern soul blues to Robert's own style of smooth late night soul blues.Elsewhere his own songs are very much on a par with these soul classics, opener \"You move me\" is probably the album's most bluesy song, with really nice stinging guitar and the instrumental \"Hip tight onions\" is pure Booker T and the MGs. There are also some really nice trademark Cray super-smooth soul ballads - with two of my favourites \"What Would You Say\" and \"Pillow\" starting off with strange almost psychedelic guitar effects before turning into typical Cray melodic heart-felt ballads. Looking forward to seeing Robert in early May in Birmingham during his UK tour."
A1CRWKYZYJUF7D,B00I0TFR4M,5.0,Another great release from Robert Cray. Nice to also see that he's doing material written by other members of the group. Lends a nice color change. Also enjoyed the instrumental which I think is a first for Cray. All in all a great release. Thanks Robert Cray Band.
A3IZB368BG43JS,B00I0TFR4M,4.0,Not a lot to say- If you like Robert Cray this is more of the same good stuff
A1Z1212RWBVZLF,B00I0TFR4M,5.0,Cray has consistently made incredible music since the late 80's when he broke out. This record is right up there with all his best.
AI721HAU2SF0C,B00I0TFR4M,5.0,"i wonder with time if the artist will change,but i'm happy to say robert cray has remianed true tothe blues. i remain a fan, and look forward to the next c.d.so i can listen to the progression of his dedication to the art called blues.for those who love the blues as i do, i recommend you at least give this c.d.a listen.ted turner"
A3LCELE0UOBRMX,B00I17OA8W,3.0,"The CD is good, but had I known the music would be exactly the same as is on his CD &#34;Voices,&#34; I would not have bothered to buy this album.  Very disappointing and it seems as if he keeps reusing the same music over and over again; not much new and I'm going to quit buying his music!"
A1CI5HBWL0C86N,B00I1XYDUQ,5.0,He's one of the most sought after bass players in the world and this cd will not disappoint !! Great project !
A33DITYFYI63E5,B00I2V6JKE,4.0,"I like Shakiras' music --it is lively and upbeat, and just makes you want to get on your feet and dance. This CD is no exception so put on your dancing shoes and enjoy!!"
A21K28EQ023UUU,B00I2V6JKE,2.0,Only enjoyed song#2 and maybe #1. Track 3 sounds like Gotye's &#34;somebody I used to know&#34;..... This CD has no theme...I don't even hear Shakira in it. She sounds like Britney sometimes. Lots of styles in this CD. Didn't like it. Was surprised at overall positive reviews.
A3VUSYA3W0FVV7,B00I2V6JKE,5.0,i love this cd . i'm glad i bought this  because she's one of my favorite singers! like one of her songs which i kept playing over and over so to me this item is really worth buying.
A1EWN2Q5ENRDDM,B00I32F35Y,5.0,"After hearing this, I truly believe that Delain has the ability to become one of the biggest bands of the genre. This album cemented them as one of my new favorite bands. The band got heavier on this one and a little darker. Some of the tracks have the most tastefully done electronica sounds that fit really well and never come across as worthless pop drivel. If you are a fan of Metal with melodic vocals, harmonies and a multidimensional sound, buy this.........along with April Rain and We Are The Others."
A19HRYV1HO3O02,B00I32F35Y,5.0,"I never knew about this band and when I discovered them, I instantly fell in love with their music. I especially love the song, &#34;Stardust&#34; on this album."
A2ELLM0FHBUIHZ,B00I3TWZ9Y,3.0,"I've now listened to this collection a half of dozen times and most of tunes are not bad, actually most are good covers, but as with the majority of tribute releases over time most people would just rather listen to the original and a disc like this is rarely played after 6 months. Tribute albums seem to do better when they are done for great Singer Songwriters that don't have a perfect voice and Jackson Browne does not fall into that category.  The biggest problem here is that so many of these songs are following the same style and arrangement as the original and even if they were enjoyable I found it hard to not want to hear Jackson doing them.There were a few  highlights I liked and they were Bonnie Raitt & David Lindley doing Everywhere I Go, Bob Schneider doing Running On Empty and Bruce Hornsby doing I'm Alive.  Other tunes that stand out to me were done by the ladies especially Karla Bonoff, Sara Watkins and Joan Osborne."
A2JQ86TDEMECQR,B00I3TWZ9Y,2.0,"I purchased, and listened through a couple times,  Artists put in a lot of effort.  I purchased because I wanted to hear Karla Bonoff sing &#34;Something Fine&#34;.  I got what I wanted.  It is an amazing rendition.  The rest is good, but I would rather hear Jackson do."
A20J0TSK93JUWV,B00I45814A,5.0,LOVE the new Winger CD~some heavy hitting songs with some great guitar riffs from Reb Beach~highly recommend it if you are a fan
A4J0KE60CKSHE,B00I45814A,4.0,"Another great release from Winger.  Ever since 1993 these guys have been shelling out near perfect albums.  Forget the 80s, everything thing since is what these guys should be known for,Six out the 10 tracks on Better Days Comin' are amazing, the other 4 all above filler status.  Just a great album to put on and listen to start to finish.Personal fave is &#34;Ever Wonder&#34;.  As another reviewer mention, this is thinking man's music."
A2Q8HBYGPJMUCS,B00I45814A,5.0,"Kip Winger has always had a slight progressive meld with hard some good hard rockin tunes - what made him so popular in the 80's I believe.  Many years later this album has a stronger touch to me of some fantastically complex progressive flavor - once again mixed with some hard rocking simplicity.  Genius really.  Helps to have some intelligent, thinking woman/man's lyrics.  Thank you Kip for this musical journey! Good to have you back!"
A3FMA9NA750SUT,B00I45814A,5.0,Winger's Newest CD is Freaking Awesome!  The Deluxe Edition is nice with the bonus track...as well as the DVD of the making of the new album which shows the band in the Collaborative Process!!!  Anybody who Likes WINGER IS GOING TO LOVE THIS NEW CD!!!
A2UXP4B1Z05IY5,B00I4826V6,3.0,"I have been a huge Lacuna Coil fan since the early days and have all there albums.this new album for me is a letdown I thought the last two albums Shadow Life and Dark showed a lot of growth and had a chance of helping the group to get a bigger audience and some radio play, but  this album is a step back .since I bought this album a few weeks ago i have listened to it a bunch of times and no songs stick out as great or memorable.Christina's voice remains strong and wonderful one of the best female hard rock singers around and the band still sounds very good .but there are no catchy melodies I like the ballads which show Christina's vocal range,but the male singer is very annoying  shouting all the time and ruins a lot of the songs and does not add anything.Christina saves the music when she comes in on each chorus with her angelic voice.this album is not as good as Comalies which is there best album ever or Shadowlife which i like a lot also .this is the weakest album since Karmacode but if your a huge fan like me there are enough good moments to give it a listen but not a favorite of mine . a 3 rating !"
AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B00I4826V6,5.0,"Since first hearing this Italian goth metal band, I have always been a fan. The one-two punch of Cristina Scabbia&#8217;s hauntingly powerful vocals and Andrea Ferro&#8217;s deeper more gruff sounding voice gives them a unique sound when combined with the instrumentals of the talented band members supporting the two singers. Each album seems to have it&#8217;s own personality and are equally strong in presenting a solid set of tracks that all seem to fit together&#8230; and Broken Crown Halo is no different. This new album of 11 strong tracks presents the theatrical and powerful sound this band&#8217;s fans love and yet somehow seems intriguing and fresh at the same time. Maybe it&#8217;s just that after all these years&#8230; they formed in 1994&#8230; the band still has a strong passion for their music. And no more proof of this then in the fist pumping opening track &#8220;Nothing Stands In Our Way&#8221; that hits us with a blast of Ferro&#8217;s fierce growl and intense guitars and keyboards with Miss Scabbia joining in for a head banging anthem whose title says it all. The album and it&#8217;s songs are filled with the type of gothic lyrics we expect from Lacuna Coil evoking dark images, equally dark emotions and creatures of the night but, not without a glimmer of hope or a chance of overcoming the darkness. No matter how bleak or gloomy things get, the band&#8217;s songs always seem to offer the strength to overcome or carry on, such as in the song &#8220;Victims&#8221; which is about being anything but. My favorite songs are always the ones where Cristina Scabbia really cuts loose such as &#8220;Hostages To The Light&#8221; and &#8221;I Forgive (But I Won&#8217;t Forget Your Name)&#8221;. While certainly no slight meant to the talented Andrea Ferro&#8230; who can hold his own quite well vocally&#8230; Scabbia has one of  the best voices in rock and obviously it&#8217;s a feast for the ears when she unloads with her full range. She and Ferro compliment each other very well, which is why the songs sound so rich especially when layered with the instrumentals which sometimes go beyond guitar, bass, keyboards and drums to have a more orchestral sound. Again, their stuff is very theatrical but, producer Jay Baumgardner has ensured it&#8217;s all mixed perfectly with one element never overpowering another, despite the strength each element has on it&#8217;s own. All the pieces come together to compliment the big picture. No better example of this deft production work then the powerful &#8220;Cybersleep&#8221; and the somber final track &#8220;One Cold Day&#8221; which contain all these elements in an intoxicating mix. And despite their flair for dramatic sounds, none of the songs ever overstay their welcome with even the 6 minute + &#8220;One Cold Day&#8221; seeming just right in it&#8217;s length. Obviously I am biased. I love this band and am a huge fan. But, it still doesn&#8217;t overshadow the fact that this band consistently puts out quality albums with few, if any, weak songs. Obviously, you have to be a fan of this kind of music and as someone who loves both metal and goth/industrial, I get the best of both worlds from Lacuna Coil and they deliver solid album after solid album. I have yet to be disappointed by one of their discs and I don&#8217;t expect to be anytime soon. And Broken Crown Halo is about as far from a disappointment as one can get. A powerful, consistently strong album of songs from a band that is passionate about making their music and let&#8217;s you hear it for yourself in every track. If you&#8217;re a fan, I highly recommend this, their latest album. If you&#8217;re not familair with them but, love metal or goth metal, I equally and enthusiastically recommend you give Broken Crown Halo a spin. Lacuna Coil also includes Cristiano Migliore, Christiano Mozzati (who both retired from the band early this year but, are featured on the album) Marco Biazzi and Marco Cot Zelati along with Andrea Ferro and Cristina Scabbia. All songs were written and composed by the members of Lacuna Coil and Jay Baumgardener."
A2FAF1J19NO0ID,B00I4826V6,5.0,"This is a kick ass album that really shows off Cristina's vocal talents, the beauty of her words. Andrea's vocals are his best to date."
A1X73QJ7D1W57Q,B00I48RAGW,5.0,"I have been a huge fan of Aimee Mann ever since her hitmaking days with Til' Tuesday. A beautiful vocalist and a brilliant songwriter (almost) up there with the classic three: Carole King, Carly Simon, Joni Mitchell. But perhaps her latest albums have not been able to ignite quite the same admiration and excitement as most of previous work.So I must say this album comes as a pleasant surprise. Here she teams up with guitarist Ted Leo, who is also himself an accomplished singer and composer. The duo playing all instruments except the more than able drumming from Scott Seiver. In fact it's a real joy to hear Aimee back on the bass she handled so fine in Til' Tuesday.What we got here is 10 intelligent, well-crafted and catchy originals (in fact every song has hit potential) and a Thin Lizzy cover  &#8216;Honesty is No Excuse&#8217; . Some driving energy combined with more introverted moments. And noisedriven solos, almost in Neil Young style courtesy of Ted Leo.The best album from Aimee since her masterpiece *Lost In Space'."
A148RTA1RGDF4J,B00I48RAGW,5.0,"If you like both Aimee Mann and Ted Leo, you will probably like The Both. Their voices blend well, as do their talents. As I now say on all my music reviews, we now have ample opportunity to listen to music before we buy it. Check it out, then buy if you like it - I've heard artists need to eat."
A29M5EKO4K5466,B00I48RAGW,5.0,"Aimee Mann could sing the phone book to me and I would be enthralled.  I've been a huge fan of hers for years, and this collaboration with Ted Leo is great fun.  I doubt it will break sales records or be more than a blip on the radar, but it perfectly exemplifies the term labor of love, as the enjoyment these two discovered while working together comes across in every perfectly constructed song."
A1QKM06MZ825UX,B00I4F0IY6,5.0,"I just received my copy of Music, Movies & Memories. Real Gone Music has done a fantastic job of putting this Cd together. First, it is first time released stuff from Doris. It is loaded with things that were never available before. I really appreciate the fact that they took the time to do an amazing job on the sound quality. I love the Cd as a whole but I have to say my favorite parts are at the end. The Doris interview and the stuff in the recording studio. It is really cool hearing Doris in the recording studio. Just wish it was a little longer, but like I have said in the past. I can never get enough of Doris Day.. Happy birthday Doris!!"
A1BEHXZTYWAGV6,B00I4F0IY6,5.0,"What can I say?  It's Doris Day--my life-long idol.  She could sit there and sing the alphabet and I would be thrilled!  It is a beautifully done set; her voice is, as always, perfect, and I totally recommend this to EVERYONE who enjoys listening to a real musician!"
A1YDS4TUIGDPUG,B00I50MNGG,4.0,"To me, as I listen to this man sing, I wonder if he has perfect pitch. He never seems off pitch, and he sings with such emotion that I think is very rare. I was happy to have discovered him on Later...With Jools Holland when he performed &#34;Iron Sky&#34; and &#34;Diana&#34;. When I heard the songs again after buying this album, I was amazed at how well he sang every single note. Truly remarkable. He has you hanging on every note."
A8ADAB3YK68G5,B00I5NKOOG,5.0,"this is a live recording of beth hart and joe bonamassa...a mix of both &#34;dont explain&#34; and &#34;see-saw&#34;...and to be honest, when i first heard &#34;dont explain&#34;, i didnt love it...only because it wasnt what i was used to in a beth hart cd (i really had no idea who joe bonamassa was at this point)...by the time &#34;see-saw&#34; came out, i was able to appreciate them both for what they are...loving odes to the music that helped shape both beth and joe...although i will say that i enjoyed &#34;see-saw&#34; more, mainly because of the song choices and the inclusion of the fantastic horn section...all that being said, this cd (and dvd) has it all...beth, joe, horns, blues, rock...the whole deal...a good mix of songs from both albums...the sound is great, and joe has more solos then in the aforementioned albums...both joe and beth do a song each from their solo careers...which i also found very enjoyable...i also bought the dvd, and must admit that i would rather listen to the concert than watch it (although the cinematography is great)...money well spent"
A2P5TD4AU516XY,B00I6JEPK8,5.0,"Could be one of hist best albums ever.  The songs, the voice the simple arrangements are spectacular. In the 40 years that I have been buying and listening to Barry Manilow, I have never heard his voice sound so great.  Clear, full and warm.  This is an excellent unexpected release.  Don't miss this."
A1WKAZFDUK82FV,B00I6JEPK8,4.0,"I remember when 2:AM Paradise Caf&eacute; was released in the 1980's.  It is still one of my favorite albums.  Night Songs is an album of very mellow songs that fit Barry Manilow's voice. It is a very relaxing CD. some of my favorite songs are AC-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive, You're  Getting To Be A Habit With Me & the Single Blame It On My Youth."
A1GKMG6EL677EJ,B00I7YGVNG,4.0,"The Kings X bass player has put together another solid sounding group of established musicians. The Korn guitar is the real treat in this album, totally supported by innovative drumming."
A1WNGPK7JQWIAE,B00I7YGVNG,5.0,"I almost didn't buy this, and that would have been a BIG mistake. George Lynch and Dug Pinnick are favorites of mine, but when I found out the drummer was from Korn, I was gonna pass. Seriously, Korn just plain SUCKS (who wants to listen to some queer crying about getting raped?!) But the drumming turned out to be one of the stand-outs on this album. Lynch is sick as always, Pinnick lays down the thump, and their are no &#34;filler&#34; songs to be found- every track kicks ass. I also own the Pinnick-Gales-Pridgen album, and this one blows that one away. You gotta get this one!"
AE29LRE6751PB,B00I7YGVNG,4.0,"This is a strong hard rock album with catchy tunes and killer guitar riffs. George Lynch really shines on these songs and sounds energized in this venture. The song writing is strong and the band sounds unique in the fact that you never feel like this songs sounds like Lynch Mob or that song sounds like Kings X or Korn, this sounds like something new and is consistent all the way through."
A259BKXJOP9DPC,B00I7YGVNG,5.0,"Wow!!!  As a guitar player, I have been a Lynch fan since the 80's, and this is one album that makes me glad he is no longer in just one &#34;band.&#34;  These three guys have created some of the freshest music I have listened too in quite some time.  Ray Luzier is an absolute beast on the drums. Dug lays down a great bass line throughout and his soulful vocals compliment every song.  I only wish these three had gotten together sooner and I hope they do not let this be their only offering."
AAR77T6K4X3XZ,B00I7YGVNG,5.0,From start till album end the album consists with the experince in playing guitar and structuring the best songs a rare gift which the new bands seems will never learn not that I&#8217;m that old that I don&#8217;t buy any albums for bands younger then me it&#8217;s the quality of music which is missing from the young bands. Here we have many new bands that seems that they just play music they don&#8217;t have the feeling maybe the only banks which is differ are black stone cherry. Anywya this is the old to any fan of dokken the 80s era that is \m/ and for sure lynch and the real hellraisers the bands which started rock n roll with long hairs and beautiful girls which half are dead now &#61516; this is one of the best albums that I hope will make it big and have follow up albums also if you like this one get winery dogs you can never go wrong \m/ rock on. this is a good year for rock and metal many others are returning and scorpions still alive and kicking these are the bands that made my teen life soundtrack and i love them for it
A1IK72OVST18FZ,B00I7YGVNG,5.0,"I am a musican, KXM, just blew me away! I think I will agree with another reveiwer, this is the new supergroup. The best of three worlds,the music truely works . Guys keep working your magic, its killer. If you like metal and you do not grab these, guess what you missed the boat! what can I say, get it love it, its a must have!!!!!!!!"
A1765X6K1S0IQQ,B00I7YGVNG,5.0,This is an absolutely amazing record. Dug lays down great grooves and Lynch does everything from Korn type noodles to Lynch Mob solos. Ray absolutely fits with Dug as a drummer. I was wondering how the Double bass work would play out and it works. Great listen and so far a favorite in 2014.
A3COEQWQDWDAGF,B00I86JUSG,5.0,Very nice!
A2SE84FK9NZ6P5,B00I86JUSG,1.0,"I was completely disappointed. I was saddened to see this happen. It is a dark moment now. I listened in stunned disbelief. i couldn't get up for a while, just sitting there in shock."
A1U6QD51NOP4AA,B00I86JUSG,4.0,"Sarah McLachlan wants to help people.Her many philanthropic endeavours aside, you can really tell this is her mission with Shine On.  She knows the impact her music has had on her fans, and put an undeniable positive spin on this record.  Though there are ballads, the music on Shine On is upbeat and even rocks out in some spots.Lyrically, however, I find much of this album has a &#8216;Oprah gratitude journal&#8217; quick-fix, self help feeling to it.  There&#8217;s even an &#8216;it gets better&#8217; song which feels about two years too late.  That being said, the lyrics here aren&#8217;t as trite and cliche as a few tracks on Laws of Illusion were (After four years, I only go back to Laws of Illusion for Love Come and Bring on the Wonder).Unfortunately Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and to a lesser extent Solace (though it&#8217;s my personal fave), remain her most complex and compelling works.  Those albums, and her international breakout, Surfacing, connected with people on a significantly deep level.  Whether you were a young person in your challenging formative years, as I was, or an adult going through something, Sarah&#8217;s older work spoke to you as if you were on a one-to-one basis.  They were hyper-cathartic.It&#8217;s hard to criticize Sarah for the more recent songs she written simply because they speak to me less, but I can&#8217;t imagine the positive reinforcement vibe that permeates this album having as much of an impact.  It&#8217;s deeper, darker, introspective lyrics that shake you to your core, touch your soul, and change your life.  That&#8217;s how you help people.Lots of people will identify with these songs, Sarah&#8217;s songs usually have a way of doing that, but Shine On and Laws of Illusion just scrape the surface.  I don&#8217;t think in 10 or 20 years time many people will look back on these albums and say they changed or saved their lives, the way THRONGS of people credit Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Solace.Though this may sound like a negative review, it&#8217;s more a lament over a Sarah McLachlan that is now absolutely gone.  She&#8217;s a yoga mom now, not an awkward teenager. I give this album four stars, because it&#8217;s still a good album, with good intent, a good message, good music and good lyrics.  Good.  This isn&#8217;t deserving of a three star rating, and for the time being I like it more than Laws of Illusion (which I had rated a five, but I&#8217;d now rate a four).  I do wish Sarah would do some envelope pushing on her next outing.  I&#8217;ll be forever crossing my fingers."
A3UEXFWSF3R2F8,B00I89Y2SQ,5.0,"I have always loved CD and I was wondering just how successful an album of Dylan covers would be. I shouldn't have worried, this album is great."
A11YV8Y3CIA8L7,B00I89Y2SQ,2.0,"Charlie is an amazing singer and performer, with a rich history in the music business. Not every artist can be credited for playing fiddle as a studio musician for Bob Dylan. The main problem with this album is that it does little capture the essence of Dylan's original recordings. Charlie's cover versions lack the originality and creativity an artist needs in order to reimagine the songs of a legendary artist such as Dylan. This collection of songs does not seem convincing and gives the impression of an artist going through the motions and reciting the words of a song without understanding the true meaning.Unless you find this album for dirt cheap, I would recommend that everyone purchase Charlie's individual albums instead. The new Charlie Daniels Band Epic Trilogy 1 and Epic Trilogy 2 box sets are a great value."
A2LXCV64APAEHT,B00I8N299G,5.0,Since Juvenile Hell these guys have been on th radar. Then they dropped Infamous and I swear I knew then that they peaked. Nothing tops infamous. They can't even top it. But this album?  This surprised me. I didn't think they could update themselves and yet remain street wise but they did it. They remixed infamous tracks are a nice consolation prize too
A37Z81LW79DUZ8,B00I8N299G,5.0,"This album is awesome, definitely their best stuff since the 90s. Too bad this group is kinda forgotten after all these years, there are some really powerful beats on this. The lyrics are typical, it never really matured out of the egotistic meaningless street thug lyrics but it's not a bad thing if you like gangster rap. The bonus disc is an added bonus of remixes and other stuff left over from their classic 2nd album the infamous (best hardcore rap album ever) . Get this album! It's their comeback!"
AMFV9PQ4EZZ6Y,B00I8N2BLC,4.0,"John Wesley is a seriously talented guitarist. He's also a gifted lyricist on this poignant release. The solos on the first three tracks are jawdropping in their fire, passion, and intensity. I saw him on Porcupine Tree's &#34;The Incident&#34; tour and he covered Steven Wilson's solos with precision but I had no idea that he was so talented in his own right. &#34;Disconnect&#34; reminds me of some of PT's harder rocking material. Since SW has put Porcupine Tree on hold, it would interesting to hear what he'd sound like with Colin Edwin and Gavin Harrison. That's one of the only reasons I don't give &#34;Disconnect&#34; 5 stars. His band is solid and technically proficient but not nearly as interesting and surprising as those two. I also find the mix to be slightly muddy and compressed. I got it on CD and I've listened to it on three good systems. (Please tell me I'm dead wrong about this and I'll try different source material.) Nevertheless, &#34;Disconnect&#34; also gets my early vote for album of the year."
A16DPH1SCKFD70,B00I8RSQBW,5.0,i really enjoy this album. the songs are fun and i love the collaborations she does with other artists. there is one song that seems out of place from the rest of the album but other than that it's really solid.
A1ZP20AZAKWKS9,B00I9BU68I,5.0,"awesome beats, good tunes, just fun music.  a bit derogatory towards women, but that seems to be music this decade."
A10ZWA8WB0YRYZ,B00I9UEG7Q,5.0,Not what I expected but okay Rodney crowell
A1AB52W5RN8PXC,B00I9UEG7Q,5.0,Take my coat - take my hat - take my breath away - what woman doesn't want to hear something like this - Missing You is another one that will make you think and you'll be humming and singing along.  It's his latest but has great roots too!
A2ELLM0FHBUIHZ,B00I9UEG7Q,5.0,Around 2000 Rodney went from superstar country star to Americana Singer Songwriter star and since has put out many fantastic releases and this one might just be the best.  If you liked any of his previous 4 or 5 releases then you will love this one and if you haven't discovered him yet this is the place to start.  This is an album that you will still be playing 20 years from now.
AT816RV3YICE3,B00IACUO8S,3.0,"Just let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE Dio fan, from Elf to Heaven and Hell I own every Dio album that has ever come out. Some of the songs on this tribute album are fantastic (Neon Nights, Mob Rules) would be my favorites. However Tenacious D should be punched in the throat for such a horrible cover of Last in Line. It actually offends me that someone allowed this to happen. The other song I don't much care for is Halestorm singing Straight Through The Heart. I like Halestorm singing Halestorm songs. Most of the cd is bands giving tribute to Dio and singing like Dio did. Lizzy Hale made this song sound like it was for Halestorm and not Dio. Hopefully that makes sense. No disrespect to her, she is young and maybe did not know what was expected. With the money going to charity this isn't a horrible purchase but it should have had at least two less songs on the album..."
A3G53OSKOX59AM,B00IACUO8S,5.0,All the bands and performers did a great job on this CD. Newer bands and some older legends all together for Dio. Very cool indeed. The first concert I ever went to was Dio back in 1985 or 86 on the Sacred Heart tour. I have been a metal head every since. Just like the man said.........Long Live Rock & Roll!Dano
AY6VLDGM9D9PP,B00IACUO8S,5.0,"This is a fitting tribute to one of metal's all time legends.  Anthrax, Metallica, Halford, Motorhead, songs with Dio's old bandmates of various eras (Craig Goldy, Doug Aldrich, Rudy Sarzo, Jeff Pilson, Vinny Appice, Simon Wright, Scott Warren, Jimmy Bain, Rowan Robertson)&#8230;this album absolutely RIPS!!!  As many reviewers have already mentioned, the Anthrax cover of Neon Knights is amazing!  Joey Belladonna really shows his stuff and the song is so true to Dio.  I also like Tenacious D's Last in Line.  Dio would have wanted them on here, imo, and while it may not be the greatest rendition of the song in the world, it's incredibly heartfelt by one of Dio's best friends and biggest fans, Jack Black.  I like it.  The Mob Rules, Rainbow in the Dark, and I were other standouts,  Ronnie's Rising Medley by Metallica is awesome.There were a couple of things that could have made the album even better, imo.  For example, I would have liked to have heard Lemmy singing on the Motorhead song (Starstruck) and wish Halford would have just let his voice rip Priest-style on his song (Man on the Silver Mountain), but all in all, both songs were still good.  Ending with Dio's This Was Your Life was a fitting way to end the album.  Man&#8230;Dio could just flat out SING.I highly recommend this album to all fans of metal, especially fans of Dio or any of the acts on it.  Epic tribute.  RIP RJD"
A35J8PT347V8HF,B00IACUO8S,1.0,"just the same bands that we see on TV ALL the time. you know the ones. the &#34;Safe Bands&#34;. this entire record is about worth 99 cents and that's it. put it on Sale for 99cents and if it Truly all goes to the Cancer Charity that is 1,000,000 ( Million ) dollars for it.check into and Buy other Dio Tributes like the JORN one...now THAT is a Ronnie James Dio Tribute. wendy used Big Names to sell this and it will Sell but it just isn't worthy of being called a Tribute To Ronnie James."
A28I8B7NULG8YG,B00IACUO8S,5.0,"The bands that put this CD together did a fantastic job with Ronnie's music. The first track, Neon Knights, brings out Ronnie's strength in music and the rest continue it on.  This tribute CD is very well done."
A2NG9LE4Q4TE6O,B00IAHQXUQ,5.0,"One of the things that sets AAL apart from other technical bands is that their music appeals to both musicians and regular people like me. On top of that, every song is different and has its own flavor. Highly recommended!!"
A1E20XY12WPGBU,B00IBQ5M1W,5.0,"Great CD and a nice experience buy in amazon.com cause we had a problem with the taxes and the dates for the sending and they fixed immediately the problem,thank's sincerely"
A3M4ZMI0RRDQC,B00IBQ5MAS,3.0,"For me, this album is Chevelle's way of pulling through the questionability of their previous two records. There are some moments of their former song-writing prowess, even if it keeps getting bashed a bit by their tendency to go all Nickelback."
A120UTHQDQIJGH,B00IBQ5MAS,5.0,This one is a grower and definitely more heavy and exciting than the past few ones. This is their best work since the days of This type of thinking. The material is also a bit darker this time around which is a good thing for these guys. They went in that direction for Wonder What's Next and it worked really well. Overall this is a step in the right direction.
A26533IAFWR68U,B00IBQ5MAS,5.0,"Yet another great album by Chevelle. Been loving these guys since their beginning and they never disappoint. Can't wait to see the tour for this one. If you're a Chevelle fan, get this CD, if not yet one, get it and become one. Then go back and get the rest..."
A1VXSN4ZSU3ZJJ,B00IBQ5OUQ,5.0,His music is inspiring and a little rock n roll.  I love it.  Recommend to all Eric Carmen fans.  Great.

A19GXBRDD5R35T,B00ID2TRB0,5.0,"Leon Russell has always been a favorite of mine.  From the early 70's on.  I first saw him during the rock and roll revival stage in  the Leon Live era.  What a showman.  I actually liked this CD better than the Leon and Elton project.  This Cd is called Life Journey, but it is a reflection of Leon and some of his musical influences."
A18EPAQ44YJTW5,B00ID2TRB0,5.0,"Leon came out in the 60's and it was one that help make a few goo to the top. Like willie nelson and joe cocker, but he is a excellent music maker in his own way. So if you are a fan of leon this is a must have"

A3I9Q7TS5FQY0W,B00IEA3HP8,3.0,"Da Truth once was possibly the brightest face in Christian Hip-Hop, but I think since the last few albums, he has simply run out of material. No, that doesnt mean there is nothing left; it means there is nothing left that HE as an artist is able to come up with. Most of his songs sound too much like filler, with generic verses and repeated themes. The only variety is an increase with the production...lots of autotune, and a lot of featured &#34;pop&#34; singers and that variety. I like the songs Lout & Clear, I Made It, and Heartbeat, but they feature exactly what I previously stated. Too many songs here I would occasionally skip. However, the overall project does not suck, so I cannot give it a 2-star rating or anything like that. I'm kind of dissappointed, but its not a BAD album. Just an average one."
A2ZL9TG2GMKUBP,B00IEA3HP8,5.0,"Got this album this morning and so far my favorite tracks are:Compare, Heartbeat, Change The World, Promises, Coming Home, Rising Sun, Grey, I Made It, Mixed Bag, so far this album is right up there with Andy Mineo's Neverland which released in late January of this year."
A2N7699X91ZDCI,B00IF6WRBG,2.0,"on 4/11/18 I saw kenny wayne play at the experience Hendrix tour in mpls. I saw a lot of guitar players that night but kws closed the show and he was on fire. to bad that didn't happen on this cd. there are two covers on this cd that are really bad. the house is rocking by  by srv is terrible !  and feel like breaking up somebodys home,also bad . now this last song I have by the late big walter smith from the twin cities and that's a great cover song. my wife and I both listened to this and we're not impressed and I have kw's other cd's and love them but not this one ! sorry KW."
A1MWWP5SBUJ59S,B00IF8Q6JS,4.0,"I was warned these guys were good. As soon as I got to listening I LOVED it! Whether you heard 'em mentioned on That Metal Show or not, GRAB it!!! It WILL NOT be the last Kyng recording I buy. That much I can tell you for SURE!"
AZPN7ZZ7QZJNV,B00IF8Q7OW,5.0,"I remembered some of these songs and in fact, I have the original 45 record of Pepino, The Italian Mouse. But, all the others including Allen Sherman with Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah the memories just flowed back. This is an excellent compilation and it's worth getting."
A3IY9HIAMJQ7HL,B00IFFJEGI,3.0,"&#8220;Promise not to say that I&#8217;m getting too old,&#8221; Tori Amos sings at one point, but it&#8217;s amazing how young her voice sounds on that particular song. She&#8217;s 50 but could easily pass for 25. Not that having a cute singing voice is any consolation for getting old. It&#8217;s something that seems to weigh on her mind. 16 Shades Of Blue, the production of which includes some quirky sound effects, is all about aging, but the vocals, like most on the album, don&#8217;t go anywhere interesting melodically. And that&#8217;s a shame because the album&#8217;s instrumentation, which often features enchanting piano play, is just ready to wrap itself around a beautiful song.marcellee.com"
AT9HYR3ENQ6GT,B00IFS9UJQ,5.0,Definitely a must buy if you are a fan!  I'm pretty impressed how this band continues to put out excellent albums.

A1WI8621YUQKB1,B00IFSC02A,4.0,"After about 37 years of being a fan of Jethro Tull and Ian's other releases, the expectations are usually high with respect to his albums. This one doesn't disappoint - it's heady, wordy and filled with interesting musical bits that only Ian Anderson does. While I'm disappointed that he's decided to move onwards without Martin Barre - who I deeply respect as a guitarist and musician - the band on this release is very good and produces a band sound very similar to classic Tull. The CD itself is very good, as mentioned the material is typically well written and performed, and deserves to be listened to in a true non-distracted environment. Not to say that you cant put it on in the car, or while working with very good set of headphones on - but its deep and covers a lot of ground lyrically and musically. Its definitely in the top 3 of the albums released in the last 20 years under the Tull or Anderson moniker - but I'm such a big fan of Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play, Aqualung and Minstrel in the Gallery that it's tough for any new material to meet that lofty bar. But a 4/5 for this gentleman is still far far better than the best album by any of the &#34;artists&#34; currently in Top 40 rotation - Homo Erraticus is highly recommended."
A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B00IFSC02A,5.0,"This is a review of the CD/DVD package of 'Homo Erraticus'; most of the review content still applies to the April 2014 CD-only release ASIN: B00IIZ2732 and the vinyl & download/autorip formats.**********In his 67th year, Ian Anderson stubbornly refuses to rest on his laurels and bask in past glories. `Homo Erraticus' is a remarkable piece of work: original, lyrical, thoughtful, musically sophisticated with excellent sound and production values, a storyboard weaving together many narrative strands to entertain and delight.The first impression you'll receive from the CD/DVD package is that a great deal of thought and care has gone into this project: a quality, classy product greets you which respects the audience's intelligence and likely aesthetic sensibilities. The 32-page insert containing explanatory essays and all the song lyrics artistically laid out in sequence is a minor literary masterpiece on its own, and takes a good hour to read through and digest. The album tells a themed story of human colonization of the British Isles (which began, according to archaeological records, 800,000 years ago). Anderson begins in `Doggerland' with the continental land bridge at the end of the last ice age; the narrative then skips over the bronze and iron ages to `Enter the Uninvited' which quickly runs through all the influences which came in from outside:\"Angles, Saxons, Danes and NormansOn the whole a curve of learning,...Willie Conker, work cut out, in Domesday pages marks our number...Sheep and pigs amongst the hundreds,Fat tithes and taxes to encumber\"All the way to:\"Bubble gum and google-bum, Facebook-frenzied social networkApple mac and i-Phone App, Gibson,Fender sonic fretwork...\"The music underpinning this poetic lyrical narrative is as unique and engaging as we have come to expect from Anderson in his more mature years. Supported by the capable professional musical talents of John O'Hara, David Goodier, Florian Opahle, Ryan O'Donnell and Scott Hammond, mixed by Jakko Jakszyk and produced by Anderson himself the result is a seamless amalgam of catchy melodies, syncopated jazz rhythms, driving rock sections and odd time-signatures interwoven with trad English folk-idioms and references to other world-music styles. The result however is much greater than the parts, a unified style like no other: this is music for thinking people.Anderson's lyrical writing has always been good but now occupies a territory rare in popular music: it stands as poetry which may be simply read aloud, communicates complex ideas with great economy of language, is clever and witty. Delivered over the music, the result is a rewarding and satisfying experience, joyous in a way that only good art can be.The DVD includes the whole album accompanied by imagery and poetic lyrical insets; the music in 24/48 stereo and in DTS 5.1 Surround; and a thoughtful filmed interview with Anderson on the making of the album where he reveals:\"Writing songs for me is a terror...rather than waiting for the muse to turn up, you sometimes have to go out on a blind date and meet it halfway...\"and:\"What the album is all about is people going places, learning from the experience, evaluating something that you didn't know about before and benefiting - hopefully - as a consequence\"Exploring the possibility of imminent environmental catastrophe (\"The Browning of the Green\"), `Homo Erraticus' is ultimately optimistic about the ability of we humans to find a way out, to avert disaster, maybe even discover a new Eden.This is such a refreshing change from the pap which passes for popular music these days; the maturity and intelligence of `Homo Erraticus' may outlast even the best of Jethro Tull's glory years. If you like your music to be crafted for thinking people, give it a listen - or two. Chance is you'll get to like it."
AQV142R2H69QK,B00IG2ZEQO,4.0,"Anyone who heard Owen Pallet's last album \"Heartland\" knows the meaning of true love. It restored your faith in music. True you had to cut through the bizarre concept behind it of a themed album about an ultra-violent farmer named Lewis in the fictional world of Spectrum. Yet a number of other great albums have silly concepts, indeed it is understood that the Beatles recorded one? Pallet is a violinist par excellence and a musician not unlike Sufjan Stevens who is renown for orchestration which has underpinned some of the work of the Butlers in that Canadian beat combo Arcade Fire. More a composer than pop star Pallet has gone more conventional for this 2014 album \"In Conflict\" with no concept other than the strength of the songs.On balance \"In conflict\" is a much darker beast that \"Heartland\". there is nothing on her that makes you punch the air with the sheer exhilaration such as the greatest song of 2010 \"Lewis takes his shirt off\". that is not to say that the album is not rewarding. Opener \"I'm not afraid\" is a complex pop structure with a piano segment that sounds like \"Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence\" and Pallet's lush vocal delivery. The title track is kind of Rufus Wainwright meets Beach House affair and full of sumptuous layered melodies. A track like a \"Song for five or Six\" is possibly the nearest thing here that could have fitted on Heartland with its complex synths and pounding orchestration. The highlight however is a song that is gloriously simple and entitled \"Passions\". If this were a beautiful girl it would completely turn your head. Detailing some of Pallet's most personal reflections to date at one point he regretfully reflects that \"As we try to get it on in bed/ you've given me your home and head/ You put on The Queen is Dead/ But I just want to talk instead/ Compassion, compassion\". Perhaps the notoriously celibate Morrissey has that effect during copulation although the song itself is a thing of beauty. Others like \"Riverbed\" do echo the instrumental force of bands like Grizzly Bear. Sadly not all of it works \"Internal Fantasy\" for example sees the synths drown out Pallet's vocal and it all feels rather messy, whilst the \"Sky behind the Flag\" sounds like a song that Godley and Creme might have considered for a B Side.If you approach \"In Conflict\" as a straightforward comparison with \"Heartland\" the latter played the stronger hand. Yet this is Owen Pallet the gifted composer, the voice of an angel and musical polymath. He is never dull and frequently sublime. This album may lack the cohesion and joy de vivre of its illustrious predecessor but it is damn fine music and will serve well until this wonderful composer finally paints his inevitable masterpiece."
A3R5POJ0D5AZ09,B00IIT0CHG,5.0,"First,  I have always been a HUGE fan of Ms. Ronstadt, so this recording adds to my collection.Second, This was an unexpected find which I stumbled upon in a magazine ad to my delight.Third- No other female vocalist, besides Streisand , has had quite an impeccable catalogue of music.As for the CD itself, it is written that Ronstadt's favorite recording was her &#34; Adieu False Heart&#34; album and the three selections here opening up the album testify to that.The inclusion of the duets with Laurie Lewis and Bette Midler are very nicely done pieces and although I would have liked to seen her &#34;Heart Like a Wheel&#34; and one of the Latin pieces ( such as &#34; The Sun That You Are &#34; from Canciones de mi Padre &#34; included, this is still the best CD I have purchased this year.Love and miss you, Linda !"
A2JP5CJWZDUNAZ,B00IIT0CHG,5.0,"No one can sing like Linda could, her voice soars like no other. I have some of these tunes on other CDs but it's nice to hear them again compiled in one place, in addition to some new songs never before released. Lovely harmony, as always. Thank you, Linda, for your golden voice."
AVFSHKBN39B29,B00IIT0CHG,3.0,"Let me start by saying I am and always have been a huge Linda Rondstadt fan. Even when her primary success was coming from covering other artists' hits, I thought she actually improved on the original. And the songs on Duets continue to show her talent. But my disappointment from this album doesn't come from Linda Rondstadt, but from the selections made. Through her career, she proved that she could sing everything from Rolling Stones to Cole Porter songs. She was far ahead of her time when she made albums of 40s songs that sold millions. So why did the producers of Duets choose to focus on country and folk songs?  Surely they could have found famous artists who would have been thrilled to add their harmonizing to a more diverse selection from Linda's repertoire. I still enjoy Duets, but not nearly as much as I would have if it had been more reflective of Rondstadt's body of work."
A1X6DP80OA9MSF,B00IIT0CHG,5.0,"Duetshas multiple songs you'll remember from back in the day -- \"Don't Know Much,\" \"Hasten Down The Wind,\" \"Somewhere Out There,\" \"Prisoner in Disguise,\" etc. -- plus less familiar, memorable collaborations with other artists, such as the duets with Ann Savoy, Bette Midler, and Frank Sinatra. Buy it and glory in the singing."
A1D6PWUMDY9F7V,B00IIT0CHG,5.0,Linda Ronstadt had the voice of angel. It so sad that we will never hear it live anymore. How special is this set of Duets. It shows her stunning range and versatility. Love it all but her and JD are something special. Enjoy one of the all time greats!
AJWUQPFB60DHR,B00IIUAPCM,4.0,I like this album a lot.  It has some creative beats that you could jam to.  I would recommend this to everyone.
A3MV56LHOCYF28,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,"I love the album, from start to finish. Yes, Pharell! The chords, the lyrics, the tunes, everything I would expect from a Pharrell album."
AJNQTSR3IMW8Z,B00IIUAPCM,4.0,Pharell truly amazes with his unique creative tracks and this album exemplifies pharell eclectic style and each track on girl delivers to the listener. I've followed pharell growth from neptunes to NERD to solo artist and must say he's always evolving and delivering classic hits this is cd to add to your music collection top notch.
AYBR0BKXTQU8Y,B00IIUAPCM,4.0,"This cd is very good.  The only complaint I have is that is not long enough.  It's just that good it leaves you wanting more.  From start to finish, every track is good, just wish that is was three more tracks.  Very upbeat cd that will leave you &#34;Happy&#34;, lol.  Purchase it, you won't regret it."
A3NFTWKT4MNLQM,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,"The songs are a little eclectic, but once you listen twice you totally get it. I highly recommend this cd. Its nice clean and all age appropriate."
ANASIU8OA61GZ,B00IIUAPCM,4.0,"i've always liked Pharrell, like his collaborations w/other artists. This is the 1st CD i've purchased by him, altho' i've liked him (his music) from afar, i had to commit to getting this one. Nice mix, some ppl think isn't his best, maybe that's b/c i think he's an artist that is always changing/growing(?) and isn't that the way it's 'spose to be?"
A28V8F738Y1AYV,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,"First heard this on a red bull commercial and fell in love with it instantly so I had to have it.  Even before I looked up the specs for the song, I just knew it was Pharrell.  His voice, style, beats and rhythm are very distinctive.  Awesome road trip, and house cleaning song. LOL"
A3BNZNVIPBLVQQ,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,"Do not wait or walk to get this album, run and get it!! Every track on this album is great!Here is why I think Pharrell Williams and this album is great. First of all P. Williams \"Skateboard P\" knows how to bring the hits with fire, Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\" and \"Move Yourself to Dance\" and Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\". Secondly his style is different in a great way, he reminds me of Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder, and Prince..basically the later part.Track 1 is a throwback to 80's style Pop and R&B.; Track 2 is Michael Jackson \"Off The Wall\" /disco era. Track 3 is a nod to the 80's New Wave \"Genesis/Police/Talking Heads\" era. Track 4 sounds like something off a \"N.E.R.D.\" album/also early 80-ish.  Track 5 is my favorite song of all time and I can never get tired of it. It is a throwback to mid-60's pop and soul. Track 6 is the classic Neptunes sound which would belong on Madonna's \"Hard Candy\". Track 7 is also early 80-ish and sounds like it could have been on \"Daft Punk's \"RAM\". Tracks 8 and 9 are slow jams. The final track (10) is a throwback to the sounds of early 80's funk.Anyone who gave this a bad review either doesn't like music or can't appreciate real art. Well you can't please everyone. The next two singles should be \"Brand New\" and \"Gush\". Justin needs to get back with Pharrell on his next album. Yesiiirr!!"
A3QA4OIXTF6KS6,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,Pharrell continues to have the pulse of what appeals to folks of any age.  His sound and rhythms make one want to move and groove. a pleasant listening (and toe-tapping) experience.
AXPEBF2QP7O1F,B00IIUAPCM,5.0,"If you listen to nothing else on this CD, you can listen to Happy........  There's something about that song that just makes you smile and move.  The rest of the CD isn't bad either!!!"
A1UYAUM6JJDX1A,B00IJBAY94,5.0,Love it!
AIYGN5GGMKBG6,B00IJBAYD0,5.0,"Awesome CD Shake is the coolest song out in the Christian world, and the rest of the CD is just what I expected AWESOMENESS"
A2LNC2S5LQDSPY,B00IJNUZEQ,4.0,"New singer was a good decision overall. Styles are similar, but with a renewed vigor. A lot of songs can stand on their own without needing the story told throughout this album. It will be one you like to play over and over again. It's worthy"
A204XJP68W4CKY,B00IK7NC9G,4.0,Some great work on covering Gregg's songs with even Gregg on a few of them. Great addition to any GA collection.
AOCHDUJR8KA2L,B00IK8WRR8,5.0,I have several 4th Dimension live discs this one is one the the finest! The song selection is perfect and John and company -- it's the performance you always wish you'd caught on tape. This time it happened without a hitch. Must Have
A3B2PG5CPQAQ8T,B00IK8WRR8,5.0,"I was at this show last summer and must say that I was pleased to see that is was recorded and captured forever. It was one of the best McLaughlin shows I have ever seen, and I have seen em all since BOF. 70 years old and still bringing it. Ettiene Mbappe on bass is unreal. Ranjit Barot drums with power and precision and Gary Husband just kills on keys and drums as well. The sound quality is crystal. A must have for Mahavishnu fans. Get it"
A1DP3U5TYSZT0G,B00IK8WRR8,5.0,"I don't care what anybody says. I think that John Mclaughlin is a better guitarist now than he was in his 20's and he's in his 70's.He would put most guitarists in their 20's to shame.  Backed by a killer band of Etienne M'Bappe(bass), Ranjit Barot(drums) Gary Husband(keyboards,drums) which makeup the 4th dimension makes this boston gig one to remember.  Highlights? Where should i begin? The whole cd was great but i will point out they did a sweet version of &#34;Senor C.S&#34;,&#34;Call and Answer&#34; and &#34;You Know,You Know&#34;.  I will recommend this live cd to anyone who is a big fan of John Mclaughlin."

AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00IKM5N5W,5.0,"If there's any band who deserves a boost from the recent spate of \"kickstarted\" projects, it would be Sevendust. The Atlanta quintet has pummeled through nearly two decades of unlikely highs and unbelievable lows to earn notereity as one of the hardest working bands in rock music today. Consistently pumping out album after album at just the right pace and getting by with little to no support from radio or mainstream media, they have flourished where lesser bands have crumbled. Anyone who has followed this band since the '90s knows the deal. They may not be the biggest name on the block, but they certainly deserve to be. So when the guys took to crowdfunding their latest album, the acoustic \"Time Travelers & Bonfires,\" it seemed a no-brainer that their fans would back them up and then some. And in true Sevendust fashion, they've paid the fanbase back with interest.For the most part, \"Time Travelers & Bonfires\" is the spiritual successor to 2004's unplugged set, \"Southside Double-Wide.\" But whereas that release was a live chronicle of the band's well-known repertoire at the time, this newest addition to the Sevendust catalogue is split evenly between new compositions and old standards. The split is an even six songs each. The first half of album is front-loaded with all-new material and it's remarkable how quickly the creative juices with this band re-charge, merely a year after releasing another knock-out with \"Black Out The Sun.\" \"Come Down,\" \"Bonfire\" and \"Upbeat Sugar\" are unmistakably Sevendust, but the band takes advantage of the format and infuses a little more playfulness than is usually found on their recorded material. And like their best material, these songs are chockful of hooks. \"The Wait\" is perhaps the shining moment of the album. An emotionally charged ballad of sorts, it almost feels like a retrospective of the band's career and what seems like a lifetime being unfairly left on the backburner. It's powerful stuff, and as always, it is driven home with the soulful and always passionate delivery of lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon.The bottom half of the album finds the band dipping its toes into the back catalogue, turning heavier cuts like \"Denial\" and \"Karma\" into mellow gold. A new take on \"Black,\" a track that the band had all but sworn off playing ever again, tops of the album off with appropriate symmetry. It's the track that effectively brought Sevendust into the world and as such, it is the  perfect bookend to an album that pays tribute to the band's past and future. In the end, if you already own the staggering nine albums that came before, then you can bet that \"Time Travelers & Bonfires\" is more than worth your time. For better or worse, Sevendust never disappoint and if you get a chance, be sure to check them out on the road supporting this album. Their first acoustic tour in over ten years, this is a rare chance to catch the band in the most chatty and laid-back of moods. And if nothing else, it's a celebration of the band's storied history that each fan should witness firsthand, much like this album."
A2I2GLX3WAWIQS,B00IKM5NZC,5.0,The sound quality is amazing considering these were recorded 60 years ago. They sound like they were recorded yesterday. We owe a debt to the archivist who found these 16&#34; vinyl transcriptions. The four shows are numbered to #11 so there's hope more will be found. How many of these shows were recorded?
A2A41GDA87I39,B00IKM5O60,5.0,"I'm very happy with my copy of Rush - ReDISCovered LP Box, it is very beautiful, but i'm a little disapointed that the digital download of the album, is only available for the U.S.A., i'll hope that this will soon be reconsidered.Thank very much!!!!"
A1SEJQQTN6H9IV,B00IMFRKI0,4.0,"Much respect for this band &#34;The Horrors&#34;. This newest release from them is a beautiful piece of work start to finish. I just got this album today 06/23/14. I have listened through it 3 times (so far). At the start I could feel a storm of some remarkable music getting ready to happen then my goose bumps kicked in and I just felt so happy to be hearing more material from this ELITE band. Currently I can't pick favorites from &#34;Luminous&#34; but let me tell you, it's all gorgeous. Extremely Strong recommendation to get this album and just enjoy the ride:)"
A26JUYKNZY0RT,B00IMTOK84,5.0,decent album. it was going to be hard to top their third album between the devil and the deep blue sea which is awesome itself but this one is just fell a little short .still you will enjoy it.
AXMXIL26FB0R,B00IN5ZQNA,5.0,"A new album from my current favorite artist, Tobias Sammet is out and to my ears the title track and one other song stand out. I will not give up however, as he is in my opinion one of the most creative forces out there keeping &#34; Power Metal&#34; alive and well. Hopefully he will tour again and I will be priveledged to see him in action. Keep the flames burning, Tobias! I am all ears!"
A274EO7M9ICQU3,B00IN5ZQNA,5.0,This cd is awesome from start to finish even the long songs that total 8 or so minutes this is a great way to sit back and relax
A1DSES64WY3DGM,B00IN5ZQNA,2.0,"Okay, I hadn't heard an Edguy album in many, many years.  So what the heck, I figured I'd buy the album and hear what they've been up to.  Whoa, what a mistake, I can't quite believe just how bad this band has become.  Musically, vocally, writing, yuck.  Wow."
AR8L4V1ZBP6FT,B00IN6VEH6,5.0,Incognito is one of my buy without thought artists. This CD is the same as others by Incognito...Excellent!
A6Q2I0FYDDFVF,B00IN6VEH6,3.0,"The Vanessa Haynes shrieking and screaming lead vocal tracks on this mixed bag Incognito CD had me reaching for the mute button. At least there is something to like with Rapture, Hands Up If You Wanna Be Loved, Hats, I See The Sun, and Never Known A Love Like This. But the rest is a bit of a let down and surprising that it is coming from Incognito, which are generally so consistent with their releases. The title track Amplify My Soul has an interesting groove but it is never allowed to develop as it ends prematurely as Track 1 and then it reappears for a couple more minutes at Track 8 - why? This could have been a great instrumental track if the producer let the band run with it and include some soloing. Like another reviewer said the album is too long, much better to cut out the filler tracks and focus on the material that has merit."
A1WVD76TPZBBOB,B00IN6VEH6,5.0,"Incognito is one of those bands that fill the heart with his excellent music. No doubt that this CD contains. Great music, good vocals and the unmistakable style of INCOGNITO."
A3K2PT269IPSD,B00IOS45Y2,3.0,"I love Styles P. I download almost all of his mixtapes. I also loved his EPs &#34;Float&#34; and &#34;World's Hardest MC Project&#34;, With that said, this album is kind of disappointing compared to the others. It 's not a bad album, but definitely not up to his prior work,"
A3FHN6AIATT19K,B00IP96A3Y,2.0,"I'm a fairly big fan of the Eels from their first major U.S. tour back when their first LP came out.  I saw them that time at Liberty Lunch (R.I.P.) in Austin, TX and really enjoyed the show and became a fan.  Since then I've bought around 1/2 of their studio CDs and the two main collections with the bonus discs and videos.  I also have seen them in concert several more times in their different lineups & phases including the string section tour at Park West in Chicago and even saw them at Lollapalooza.I will have to say that I should have more carefully read the user reviews before I stepped into this CD.  It is extremely slow and depressing and that is saying a lot, for those of us who follow E.  I bought the 2 CD Deluxe version, and I listened to the first CD over a day and it never picks up.  Often on an Eels CD, for all the downer tunes at least he'll throw in a few fun tunes but that just doesn't happen here.  I even had to skip the last part of some songs because I just couldn't take it.I will update my review after I listen to the second disc but I'm almost afraid to even start it up.For any novices or long-time fans, heed my words before you jump on this purchase. Please purchase almost ANY other Eels CD rather than this one, the first 2 (Beautiful Freak and Electro-shock Blues) being the most recommended.Not knocking E., or anything as I know he's had his ups and downs in life but this is just a plain depressing listen."
AQOFQWJYJRA5W,B00IP96A3Y,3.0,"I used to be a huge Eels fan, going back as far as his 2 early solo albums (&#34;And Man Called E&#34; and &#34;Broken Toy Shop&#34;), but I have to admit that much of his post &#34;Blinking Lights&#34; material has been really tough to get into.  Cautionary Tales continues this trend: a few good tracks surrounded by a lot of filler.  It's a shame, because I think Mark Oliver Everett has real talent.  He's just not putting it to good use.  Only for die hards."
A3JK8TCVT9G3E,B00IPGGEK6,5.0,"thanx to Amazon, immediate gratification :) with Amazon Cloud Player :)  this is a MUST have for Natalie fans ;)  ~enjoy~"
A1UWVRE520HNWW,B00IPGGEK6,5.0,Have been a fan of Natalie for a long time and instantly bought this when I saw it was available.  Very good CD.
A32183CE48CR78,B00IPGGEK6,4.0,"There might not be anything new here, but it's all very pleasant and  a little dark.  Haunting. Nice arrangements and lots of minor chords.  Catchy choruses and nice little instrumental flourishes abound.  If you're a fan, you should like this.My only complaint is that, and no reflection on the art or the music, but Amazon should start including a digital booklet with downloads.  I will often buy from a competitor in order to get that.  Amazon, are you listening?"
A2GJXG6JMHBD60,B00IPL2BCQ,5.0,"Those amazing folks over at Eagle Rock Entertainment have opened their vaults to release Little Feat&#8217;s Live In Holland 1976 as a CD + DVD set.  These discs are the first ever release of this concert in any format.The CD+DVD set captures Little Feat&#8217;s barn-burnin&#8217; performance at the famous Dutch festival Pinkpop on June 7 1976, and features the band&#8217;s classic line-up of Lowell George (vocals, guitar); Bill Payne (keyboards, vocals); Richie Hayward (drums); Paul Barrere (vocals, guitar); Sam Clayton (percussion) and Kenny Gradney (bass).This legendary line-up performs fan favorites like Rock And Roll Doctor, Dixie Chicken, Feats Don&#8217;t Fail Me Now, Skin It Back, Teenage Nervous Breakdown, Fat Man In A Bathtub, and many more.Little Feat is one of the most influential American bands of the seventies. Founded by Lowell George (formerly of Frank Zappa&#8217;s Mothers of Invention) and Bill Payne in L.A. in 1969, Little Feat produced a series of highly original albums over the next decade. They mastered an eclectic blend of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, blues, country, folk, soul and jazz before the death of Lowell George in 1979 ending the first phase of the band&#8217;s existence. The band&#8217;s earthy, organic approach blended with their top-notch musicianship solidified their legacy in the musical landscape. The four surviving members of this classic line-up are still performing and recording as Little Feat today.Boomerocity.com"
A353HIPDWRV4LM,B00IPL2BCQ,2.0,I was very disappointed with the quality of the recording (Bootleg?) I loved Little Feat but it appears that we have already heard all  of the good stuff.
A2V92ZDS346ALZ,B00IPL2BCQ,5.0,"It's actually quite difficult to say something about an event that happened nearly 40 years ago, because you wonder why it took so long for those persons responsible for this release to wake-up & do something about it !!!This is an outstanding performance of the band captured with all the players on fire !The CD reveals an amazing performance from the band. The improvisations here are very different than from what I've ever heard elsewhere from the Feat, & they're also playing so laid-back & yet heavy, you wonder at how they were ever considered a mellow band !!! All the band members play 110%, but I have to say that I've never heard Lowell George sing or play his guitar better in a live performance !Sonically, the disc suffers a little for age, but simply adjust your ears prior to listening into &#34;out-door-stadium gig in-front of 5-10,000 people&#34; in 1976 mode, & all is more than well !The DVD is splendid with plenty of different camera angles complementing a fine Feat performance. As mentioned above, sound quality doesn't suffer at all, it's just that it's 1976, so just prepare yourself for a 1976 out-door stadium recording & you'll possibly be impressed with the final result, as I have been. All the technical issues of sound-monitors not working & feedback etc are revealed, as that's just how everything was back then, so in effect it delivers a very very honest & powerful performance from a very special band.I absolutely love this CD/DVD collection, & think it has to be oustanding value for money for something that many will consider priceless...Enjoy it folks !"
A38CWQHV6DRROT,B00IPL2BCQ,5.0,Classic Feat! That's really all anyone has to say
A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00IQ8TQMG,4.0,"Jim Gaffigan, if you didn't know, is one of the hardest working clean comics that there is today. It's hard to find good comedians that don't go blue, even just once in a while, and aside from Brian Regan, Gaffigan is among the most reliable. His material is punchy, relatable, and phrased with the kind of funny simplicity that makes every bit sound like a joke you could've thought of yourself, but didn't. In other words, he finds just the right spot on your brow to hit every time, so that he's not going so high brow that it feels distancing, but not so low brow that it makes your eyes roll.As comedians go, he doesn't stray too far from what has always worked for him. In Gaffigan's case, that means he makes a lot of jokes about food, laziness, and the general idiocy of human rituals (weddings, lingerie, bars), and most of his jokes are one-liners delivered without the kind of self-awareness that would make them seem cheesy. As part of a general diatribe or complaint about the world, the strung-together witticisms gain a lot more punch to their lines. If you tried to parse them out individually, they would seem a little cheesy (\"Hot dogs are like strippers: you don't want to know their backstory\").I've never listened to an album of his that I didn't like, so if you're going by that, then you should not only buy this album, but every other one he's done. Especially \"Doing My Time,\" \"Beyond the Pale,\" and \"King Baby.\" However, this album only warrants four stars for two reasons.First, early Gaffigan would often interrupt his own bits, speaking as if he were some offended female audience member. He does this less and less for every album, and I think it's to his detriment. Although he's a solid comic with observational material along the lines (and even more so) of hey-day version Seinfeld, he does tend to run over the same rails: food, laziness, the mundane and stupid. And because his jokes are so simple and unadorned, they run the risk of seeming hacky with enough repetition and time. His audience member persona was a level of hilarious self-awareness that made the simplicity of his material seem even more amusing, like how putting up a second mirror in a dressing room can give you a better sense of how well an outfit hangs on your body. The fake audience character meant you not only laughed at how funny the joke was, but also at how funny it wasn't. It was a brilliantly used conceit that he's sadly phased out of his routines.Secondly, I've listened to everything Gaffigan has done, and he repeats a few jokes here that have been in previous albums, specifically his bit about public restrooms and being born under the sign of Cancer. Granted, he manages to tie the last recycled bit into a few really great segments regarding seafood and cancer (hats off to the man; he actually makes cancer seem funny for nearly two minutes). And also, he's repeated bits before, but mostly his infamous Hot Pockets routine. At any rate, for a man who gets so much work and does it so well, it's a bit of a strike against him that he feels the need to recycle old bits.Minor quibbles against a giant in the genre, if you're even halfway considering getting this album as a Gaffigan newbie or a long-time fan, you've got no reason not to click Buy."
A2O57LB3BP3WTS,B00IQASCA6,4.0,"If you didn't read my review for the previous version of this album, which was released under the title IN IT TO WIN IT, let me go more in depth than I did last time. First off, they cut out three of the songs, which could count as a flaw that this album has, but my theory on the matter is that they either wanted this album to be much more cohesive, or they wanted to fit less tracks on the physical release. That being said, the tracks on this album have grown on me a lot more than they previously have, particularly tracks like CHOKE, 1000 EYES, the title track, and THE ENEMY. Like I said when I reviewed IITWI, SALIVA is becoming a much better band than they were with albums such as UNDER YOUR SKIN, BLOOD STAINED LOVE STORY, and of course CINCO DIABLO.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"
A1NX8E04PZG7TO,B00IQE4NUK,1.0,This CD is one of the worst Cd's of the year...I get it Martin was dealing with a break-up...still that is no excuse to release a boring tuneless CD.  Out of 9 tracks only 2 are memorable.  Only for the most die hard fans.
A18UILH0HNDDGY,B00IQE4NUK,1.0,What a bomb!  So disappointed for coldplay witj this CD.  Was a true waste of money.
AZAS8BWCC22GU,B00IQE4NUK,4.0,"Ghost Stories won't end up being my favorite Coldplay CD, but I'm glad to add it to my collection of Coldplay music. It's different in a way. I think it's all about Chris Martin's broken marriage; if you listen to every word, you feel like your heart is broken too."
A3JMGWVMC4SD9G,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"Another solid record by Coldplay.  Although it seems to be a little more mellow than past recordings and does contain fewer songs, I'm still drawn into the music.  A very strong group of talented musicians!"
A2MGJ2LB5ZJ7E,B00IQE4NUK,2.0,"Well it's finally happened. Coldplay has attained Lite FM status. The ony thing that could make this album more ho-hum is listening to it while on Xanax. The melodies are unmotivated. The lyrics are predictably sappy and uninspired. It's a mish mash of pablum, a hodge podge of incessant whining. The end results make me want to take a long nap. If you're going to try and do music that's introspective, it should make you feel refreshed and renewed at the end, not drained and ready to lapse into a coma. Cheer up, Chris Martin. It's not that bad. But this CD Is."
A2NB25Z28CEWTI,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"Of course the fans are upset, Coldplay has been catering to idiots for years. I've been waiting for this album since the year 2000. Parachutes and the early EPs are easily still my favorite material from Coldlplay. Everything they wrote back then was classic. Ghost Stories is like a lush electronic ambient follow up to the ethos of that era. This is so gorgeous.Except maybe for the lead single &#34;Magic&#34; and &#34;Ink&#34;, which are ok, but kind of reminiscent of the bland Colplay. They had to compromise a couple songs so the radio will play them.Ghost Stories is my second favorite Coldplay album, behind Parachutes. So glad to have them back."
A37YTT4G2SOB3V,B00IQE4NUK,4.0,"Ghost Stories is another amazingly consistent album by Coldplay. Miles better than its predecessor, it can be equated with some of their best works. It's edgy and still \"pop\" in some level. The best songs are \"Another's Arms\", \"O\" and \"Always In My Head\". The official version is too short, so I recommend the deluxe edition with 3 bonus tracks.I just wanted some anthemic song like \"Viva La Vida\" and \"Every Teardrop\". They tried to deliver it with \"A Sky Full of Stars\", but the song is extremely pop, not to mention lyrically and melodically poor. It just doesn't fit in the album. I understand it's conceptually important to the album. The whole work feels to me like a late night wandering of depression and reflection on a failed relationship that slowly builds and eventually releases in the climax that is Sky Full of Stars. It represents coming to terms with everything, not moving on, but acceptance. But the song isn't strong enough compared to the other songs.Overall, a great great album."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00IQE4NUK,2.0,i never got the hype about coldplay and this album follows that trend. the tin can fill in parts of the instrumentation and the lyrics which seem to go nowhere and leave a gap. the tracks don't offer much variety and the production doesn't go anywhere. and chris martin vocally i can take or leave. to me they peaked a while ago and i wasn't feeling it much then and this just seems like obligation material as to making a statement.
A2CCLIJ1YPQ9XF,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"When i first heard &#34;magic&#34; i was blown away at how great the music was; i've only grown to love it even more after seeing it performed live on SNL. Once the cd was released I was happey to find that all other songs had such great music as well. The lyrics aren't particularly profound, but they fit and go along well with the theme and mood of the record. I just feel and love all the emotion poured into this colllection. It's been on repeat since I got it. Please do yourself a favor, put some headphones on, get rid of any distractions, and listen to this beautiful musical journey."
A1RNSJIOGBUYCC,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"I have always loved Coldplay.  From their calm beginnings with \"Parachutes\", to their experimental masterpiece of pop rock \"Viva La Vida\".  It's nothing new to say that they aren't considered a 'manly' band.  But who cares?  I listen to everything from metal to rap to R&B; to soft rock to pop to dance and so on.  I have no problem saying that I listen to Coldplay and own a few of their albums.  \"Clocks\" and \"Speed of Sound\" are piano rock anthems.  \"The Scientist\" and \"Fix You\" will always be considered beautiful classics.  Many called them a wannabe U2, which I saw as a compliment.  Then they released their album \"Mylo Xyloto\".  It was also a great album, but it just didn't feel like a masterpiece the way the rest of the bands work was.  I love the album as it has some of Coldplays best tracks, but it was almost just trying too hard to be something it wasn't at times.  Again, nothing against the album.  It just wasn't as amazing as the rest.  So then I hear the new single \"Magic\", months before this albums release.  I loved the subtle yet beautiful approach of the track.  Another song was also released called \"Midnight\".  It had this Bon Iver mixed with electronics vibe to it and I loved it as well.  I had hoped the whole album would experiment in that manner honestly!  Then I found out that the album was going to only have 9 tracks.  Well, to me in order for an album to be considered a full album, it has to have at least 10 tracks.  So I was somewhat hesitant at first.  The album is said to be inspired by Chris Martins breakup with Gweneth Paltrow, and that just means that this will most likely contain some of the bands most emotional material!  Now the album is finally out, and I have given it a few listens, and here is my track by track review.1.  Always In My Head:  The intro to this track sounds very ambient and peaceful before the song really starts.  The guitars are very sexy and the drums will relax you as Martins vocals serenade throughout, especially in the chorus.  Great song about constantly thinking of an ex.  Good start to the album but it ends abruptly.  9.5/102.  Magic:  The beautiful subtle single that builds upon itself so perfectly.  When I first heard it, I didn't think it was that special.  But by my 3rd listen I found myself loving the track to death.  The layers and layers of the song are gorgeous.  The last 2 minutes are amazing especially as the guitars start to intertwine.  The vocals go from soft to a somewhat rocking ending.  9.5/103.  Ink:  This is amazing.  The guitars and the peaceful pop drums.  I don't know what to say.  Every aspect of this song is beautifully done.  The lyrics continue the albums concept of getting over an ex.  I really can't express how great this song is.  Could be a single in my opinion.  It almost has this delicious throwback sound to the uplifting songs of the 90s.  Its one of those rare songs that manages to sound happy and sad at the same time.  A lot of people are saying this is one of the worst tracks.  They really must be listening to a different song than me then.  For me, this is among there best tracks to date.  10/104.  True Love:  This song literally glides along smoothly.  Martins vocals are the main showcase of this track during the first half before the song starts to take off for a beautiful ending with some haunting but delicate guitars!  9.5/105.  Midnight:  This song had a mixed reaction from people.  Many loved its new direction, and many simply didn't.  I'm one of the people who love the experimental nature of this song.  Though I'm somewhat disappointed that the rest of the album didn't sound like this, I'm still glad this track exists in the middle of the album to calm the mood.  Yes, the song has a slight Bon Iver vibe to it.  If you played me this song and asked me to guess who it's by, I definitely wouldn't say Coldplay honestly.  But that's a good thing.  It sounds gorgeous and relaxing.  Toward the end things slowly get electronic without turning into a dance song.  Definitely a great song to listen to while taking a walk anywhere while just thinking of life, or to go along with the concept of the album, think of an ex!  10/106.  Another's Arms: The song immediately starts with haunting vocals from what sounds like an angel truthfully before Martin comes in.  The 'angels' vocals come in and out of the track and each time just hits me emotionally.  There are nice guitar moments toward the end as well.  9.5/107.  Oceans:  Many were saying this song sounded like it could've been from the bands debut album.  That made me have extra high expectations.  But when I finally heard it, it just didn't click right away.  I just thought it was boring at first.  I thought I would keep skipping the track.  But something happened during my 5th listen.  Something just felt right with this song.  The acoustic guitars and string moments really compliment the heartbreaking vocals.  The ending is drawn out too long though even if it leads to the next song.  9/108.  A Sky Full Of Stars:  This is definitely the most commercial sounding song on the album.  I say that in the best way.  Its a dance piano rock track.  The band brought in Avicii to produce it, and you can tell right away by the sound of the pulsing dance beat that floods the track.  The vocals are great as always, but there is this guitar part that happens toward the end that really sells the song most for me!  This will definitely be the big hit of the album.  9.5/109.  O:  Beautiful.  A great and subtle way to end the album.  The piano riff is going to be covered by many and as will the song itself.  The outro to the track and album features some of the same type of ambient sound from the beginning.  Amazing way to leave this experience of an album!  10/10So though the concept of an entire album being about a break up and getting over it isn't original, it hasn't been done this well in a long time.  This album did what many try to do but fail.  It made me feel like I was experiencing a relationship and then slowly getting over it before realizing how life goes on.  Some of the best albums were put together as a result of a bad break up.  Think Bon Ivers break up masterpiece \"For Emma, Forever Ago\".  I can tell this album will receive mixed reviews upon release.  Many will think it's too short, or too different.  I can already see the naysayers calling it pretentious.  But mark my words, this album will be considered a classic in the years to come.  It already is for me!  This is the perfect soundtrack for moving on from a relationship or just any hard time in life.  Close your eyes and let the music sink in!  I highly recommend it."
AYDCJHBISMT8R,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"The only problem with this album is that it's too short!  Really, I think most fans will agree that the first few albums were Coldplay's best.  The last couple have been sort of hit or miss for me.  There were some amazing songs, but also some that I would have to skip sometimes.  This album is different because I can listen to the entire thing all the way through without skipping anything.  Ghost Stories is very much scaled back compared to Viva and Mylo which is a welcome change in my opinion.  I can't even choose a favorite song because they are all great.  Definitely some relax and chill out music, so don't buy it expecting a rockier Coldplay."
A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00IQE4NUK,4.0,"It's been three years since Coldplay has put out a record and each of their releases carries nothing but the greatest expectations.  2011's \"Mylo Xyloto\" was a mixed bag with fans, some reveling in its grandiosity while others spat indignation at the group's assimilation into the superficial and sometimes distasteful realm of pop music.  I can assure you, \"Ghost Stories\" is no \"Mylo Xyloto\".  But this album comes with its own caveat: expect nothing less than another full revolution by the group.  Though some songs carry their signature sound, most explore new territory and carry themes that will be either revered or reviled.  \"Ghost Stories\" is going to get the most flack from fans for its somewhat drowsy and dismal milieu, the most rankling aspect its inspiration from and focus on the dissolution of lead singer Chris Martin's marriage.  It's also a concept album, of which Martin has mused, \"The idea for me was how do you let the things that happen to you in the past - your ghosts - how do you let them affect your present and your future?\"\"Ghost Stories\" is an ephemeral album at only 42 minutes (9 tracks), and is chock-full of slow, introspective numbers.  \"Always In My Head\" is a smooth and ambient lead-in, with the album's first single \"Magic\" bringing the tempo and mood up.  \"Ink\" is surprisingly generic in its instrumentation initially but gains a bit of an edge once it reaches its chorus, Martin's ascending vocals both the highlight and saving grace of the tune.The most beautiful and subsequently melancholy of the bunch is \"True Love\", its stunted beat and beauteous strings instantly hooking the listener that craves moody love songs.  With Martin beseeching in falsetto \"just tell me you love me/if you don't then lie/oh lie to me\" and the languid and lonesome riff of Johnny Buckland's guitar, the song is gifted with just the right amount of nuance.\"Midnight\" is an ambiguous and meditative delight, albeit heavy on the vocoder, but I forgive Coldplay for its use; the softening of consonants in the lyrics does the song a favor, making it easier on the ear and accentuating flow.  It concludes with Martin's voice reverberating as if in a long, dark tunnel, the light he asks for one to leave on barely visible at the end.  \"Another's Arms\" is somewhat dark and forlorn in places, and has a strange ethereal female vocal punctuating its accompaniment; it's atypical of Coldplay's style, but it can't be any weirder than their choice of including Rihanna on their last album.\"Oceans\" is a bit repetitive in its instrumentation; it's a song that's been stripped of all pomp and pretension and relies heavily on Martin's ability to lead the listener lyrically.  Its lead-in to \"A Sky Full of Stars\" is interesting, a strange amalgam of ocean sound, church bells, and undulating synth morphing into the only high point of the album.  It's a headscratcher that the band would include just one fist-pumper in this collection, but \"Ghost Stories\" is obviously a period of quiet contemplation in the band's adventurous repertoire.\"O\" closes things out with some beautiful piano and vocal work by Martin; this is truly the man at his best, unencumbered by needless extras that would only obstruct the song's simple beauty.  There is a sense of acceptance and of letting go but still holding onto hope in this one; it tugs at the heartstrings, and quite unexpectedly.  Hidden within \"O\" is a reprise of the intro of \"Always In My Head\" with some add-ins, ending with the same hollowy echo that \"Midnight\" possesses.  It's almost Martin's way of saying that though all has gone quiet, his mind still retains the symphony of the love he once had, a resonance he will never forget.After the brash pop of \"Mylo Xyloto\", \"Ghost Stories\" is a welcome reprieve and return to musical modesty for Coldplay.  Call it a \"conscious uncoupling\" from the heavier pop themes the band has employed in the past."
A1GCLRB99TFBAT,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,Not as bombastic as their more recent releases. Enjoyed every song. Intimate and worth repeated listening. That's all there is to say.
A1BHDYT0JHIIP5,B00IQE4NUK,3.0,"Was a little disappointed. I love Coldplay and their music, but this album was a little too low key for me."
A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,B00IQE4NUK,5.0,"This is Coldplay's darkest and most introspective album since Parachutes. It has a bit of a Smashing PumpkinsMellon Collie & the Infinite Sadnessvibe to it in terms of the theme.It's a great album with mostly quite listenable songs yet it has more feeling and emotion than their last few albums for sure. Critics ragged on Coldplay in the past for not really evoking more feeling in their music, and not letting listeners in on where they stood emotionally. Ghost Stories seems more personal, and given the public divorce Chris Martin is going through as this album is released, that seems apropos.Overall, the tone of the album is quite chill with some elements of revelatory introspection as well as sadness in the longing for true love . It ranges from emotional, moving solo piano pieces like \"O\" to TrentemollerLast Resortlike ambience in \"Midnight\", to full on arms up in the air stadium anthems in \"A Sky Full Of Stars\".Ghost Stories is an album you can as dig as deep into as you want to while still looking up with optimism, and that's a good thing."
A2BP8V951HWL9U,B00IQE4NUK,4.0,"If you don't like this album, you probably much don't really like Coldplay. This is the kind of music that made them who they are. Glad they have gone back to their roots. Last couple of albums were lackluster and poppish. I was almost done with them after they featured Rihanna on a song. Luckily, they've gotten it out of their systems and are back to the &#34;Parachutes&#34; and &#34;A Rush of Blood to the Head&#34; sounds."

AZ0DHYY2QE5SN,B00IQFC06I,5.0,"In a world where deathcore music seems to be looked down upon (I'm not sure why), Tennessee based extreme metal band Whitechapel have been the exception, with 2014's &#34;Our Endless War&#34;, the band shows off their talents once again, after stumbling a bit on their previous album, this is a complete return to form and a complete buzzsaw of an album, 5 stars, enjoy"
A1JBUX2XMJCEAF,B00IQFC06I,3.0,"Quick Disclaimer: Before I get started, I want to say that this is going to be a fairly critical review, but don't quit reading--there are some fantastic tracks and moments on this album and I will address them, later on.As an avid listener of two specific styles of music and many of the genres that encompass them (Heavy Metal [I don't need to list those subgenres] and Country [Texas Country, some Nashville Country, Americana, etc]), 2014 has so far been a year of albums that have tried to do too much, and Our Endless War is yet another example. What we have here is an odd mesh of different metal genres that sacrifice the cohesiveness of the entire album. I'd argue that Our Endless War's Country counterpart is Eric Church's \"The Outsiders,\" which is to say that both encompass \"s*** flung at a canvas\" in every single way.First of all, Whitechapel continues to move further and further away from their original sound that made them so interesting in the first place. While they were undoubtedly a deathcore band, they leaned pretty heavily toward the death side of that term and it saved their music from being incessantly boring. Whitechapel also has fallen into a habit of creating ominous sounds in their choruses or near the ends of songs, as evidenced by choruses in the title track and \"Let Me Burn\" along with the ending of \"The Saw is the Law.\" I wouldn't mind this so much if it wasn't ripped straight out of Job For a Cowboy's recent sound, and therein lies Whitechapel's current problem--they sound like too many other bands. As soon as \"The Saw as the Law\" came out, people were screaming Meshuggah (and poorly done, at that). Then \"Mono\" was released and people were bitching about it sounding like Slipknot. Eventually, the title track came out and you could hear snippets of Job For a Cowboy all over the choruses in the ominous, slow moving juggernaut sound that calls to mind the title track to \"Ruination.\"I just don't get it. Whitechapel seems to be seeking what they already had--their own, unique sound--a handful of deathcore chugs but plenty of death metal inspired segments and Scandinavian sounding leads that made one think about classic death metal and Gothenburg at the exact same time. Along with that, Phil Bozeman once made use of many different styles of harsh vocals, and while this album has snippets of that, it's not nearly as frequent as it once was. I understand that Phil's main goal is for his vocals to be understandable, but in that effort he's sacrificed the usage of a wide variety of skills.And don't get me started on the lyrics to this album. For some reason, Phil felt like screaming horrible instructions (I can't type out what it is in the review) at the end of \"Mono,\" then screaming about something even more disgusting on \"Worship the Digital Age.\" Just read the lyrics to this song...you'll catch the line I can't put in the review. While death metal and deathcore have histories of gratuitously violent lyrics, these two moments in particular are beyond sickening and a very blatant attempt at being \"brutal\" and \"shocking.\" The album is also littered with silly cliches such as \"out of sight, out of mind\" and \"I've said it before and I'll say it again!\" Lyrically, \"Our Endless War\" is as bad, if not worse than \"This is Exile.\" And to think, Phil had once progressed to writing lyrics like those in \"Devolver.\"At the very least, Whitechapel's arrangements are more complex than they've ever been, Ben Harclerode, in particular, shines on this release. His drumming is tight, precise, and technically enthralling. Every note counts. Unfortunately, there are still some drawbacks. While the band's 3 guitarists show improved technical skill with each release, I'm still baffled by their unwillingness to record the solos on their records. Every guitar solo on this album was recorded by a guitarist named Ben Eller. I don't really understand how this is necessary. The band has 3 guitarists. One of them must be able to record these guitar solos, let alone perform them live. Then again, I do recall several videos of Savage butchering guitar solos live, but he's had how many years to improve his chops? At what point can us fans expect to hear well played leads and solos in a live setting? Has he gotten better? If so, what is necessary about having a guest guitarist record these solos? It's not necessarily and uncommon practice in metal circles, but can't one of these three guitarists pull it off?And then there's the sheer gimmickry of this new Whitechapel. As soon as you open the case and find the member listings, instead of \"Whitechapel is:\" you read \"Brotherhood of the Blade.\" How damn lame can this band get, at times? Jesus.Anyway, enough harping on this band, for now. There are legitimately brilliant moments on this record. \"Let Me Burn\" comes to mind as a song that just works, as a whole. While the leading riff did nothing to entice me, as soon as the chorus kicked in, I felt like I was being run over by a bulldozer. Even if I don't like that they so blatantly ripped off Job For a Cowboy (I do love Job For a Cowboy, by the way--the criticism isn't meant to imply it sounds bad; it just sounds too similar) elements in the chorus, Whitechapel pulls it off. Another fantastic track, \"Diggs Road,\" is without a doubt one of the best songs this band has recorded. It's remarkably emotional, and instrumentally precise. The inclusion of two guitar solos is a first for Whitechapel, and they really help take this song over the top. About the solos--even if they were recorded by a guest guitarist, I must say that each solo on this album is neither too short or too long. They never seem to waste notes, and yet never seem to cut out too early. Even if the album isn't great, that element was remarkably impressive.Overall, \"Our Endless War\" is Whitechapel's third weakest effort. While self titled showed that they'd be moving away from the deathcore sound, it still had enough Whitechapel elements for me to truly enjoy, but I don't know if I could place it above \"A New Era of Corruption,\" which seemed to show some real potential for the way they blended genres at the time, instead of this new method of recording songs that fit into different genres and then trying to put them on a track list to a single album.With \"Our Endless War,\" listeners get excellent moments, but as an album it's a three legged stool that doesn't sit level."
A1IY5CJK0LMC71,B00IQFC086,5.0,Chris Robinson Brotherhood continues to carry the Grateful Dead torch more than any other band making records today. And they do it without sounding like a cover band. The new album contains the rockers as well as the country flavored tunes with a healthy dose of the psychedelic thrown in for good measure that fans have come to expect from the band. Any fan of the Dead or jam music should pick this up asap.
A24N1BAS3CU27H,B00IQFC0S6,5.0,"Johnnyswim comprises Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano, and their sound is a Folk/Country/Soul hybrid. &#34;Diamonds&#34; is their debut album (they had released a few EPs previously) and it cracked the Billboard top 40 last week.The bouncy Folky title track opens the album with both trading verses. Abner's smooth croon reminds one a wee bit of John Legend, while Amanda's dusky tones recall Alicia Keys.&#34;Trouble&#34; is a groovy midtempo number - very Black Keys, while &#34;A Million Years&#34; alternates between tender ballad and bouncy joint. &#34;Closer&#34; is a tender piano ballad, &#34;Live While We're Young&#34; is a soulful ballad, while &#34;Pay Dearly&#34; is guitar-driven blues with Abner handling the vocals.Other standouts are the tender acoustic &#34;Paris In June&#34;, the upbeat &#34;You And I&#34; (with an anthemic Disco-tinged chorus), the bouncy hand clap-driven &#34;Home&#34; (laced with accordion), and the theatrical ballad &#34;Over &#34; with interesting percussion patterns and trilling guitars.Their lyrics are sprinkled with biblical imagery, and most songs have a nice playful jam session as a coda. The title track &#34;Diamonds&#34; refers to pressure that makes coal turn into diamonds, as the album was recorded under the shadow of loss; Abner had lost his dad, and Amanda her mum - Donna Summer, but despite the sometimes somber tone, hope, beauty and love shines through."
A12JUNJANLLHOR,B00IQFC0T0,5.0,"DAMN! I/we have been needing this kinda metal for awhile. These guys go for the throat! 'Stagnant Water'- just straight up moves me! 'New Southern'-come on! A New Orleans stripper would have a field day dancing that tune!If your a fan of Texas Hippie Coalition, Pantera, Soil (Ryan McCombs era), Brand New Sin...anything with a ballzy vocalist you gotta get this!"
A1LFAURX1H4V42,B00IQFC0VS,5.0,mix of different styles makes this a great experience. If they would have concentrated on a single style they might be better known. but the mix makes the difference. strongly recommended !
A2Q5T0OY51CN62,B00IRJHJBO,4.0,"i believe their second release was their best. seeing these guys live is amazing. but this album certainly isnt as terrible as people make it out to be. i definitely liked this album but yes, it is NOT their best. but that doesnt mean ill bash them like most of the people out there...these days you cant please anyone. youll have people complaining &#34;get rid of generic breakdowns&#34; then they get rid of them &#34;where are the break downs&#34;? if youre a fan youll just be happy to see their return. like i am. i would like to see them go back into the melodic sound again."
A2EI61B34OKF52,B00IRJHJBO,1.0,Miss may I has always been a good band to listen to until they released this horrible album. Like where are the heavy breakdowns like usual and the awesome screams? They r just non-existent in the rise of the lion. I'm not the only one who feels this way. Everyone I know is disappointed by this album....I mean it's not all there fault because the producer has a lot to do with it but I wasted my money on this. It seems at Heart was there last awesome album.
AUN07F84JU60Q,B00ITAPW56,5.0,"Quite simply, I bought this release for the remastered Greatest Hits disc and--speaking of--they did an awesome job on this remaster. Playing it through my Q701 Quincy Jones reference headphones was revelatory. Before I even listened to the first disc, I was wondering if I should just rate this release 5 Stars for the Greatest Hits alone, even though I was prepared to hate the new disc. That turned out not to be a problem though, because I like EVERY song on the new disc. Yes, I would prefer that the Lowrider Band and it's original 4 War members reunite with Lonnie, I usually hate bands that carry on in name only, with one original member, like Foreigner, as an example. But Lonnie does a very good job here, there is fine musicianship throughout and a definite War-like feel to these songs, this is a great disc for Summer. I get why people don't like the new disc, but I wonder if, like me, they were predisposed to hating it? I would recommend this disc for the remastered Greatest Hits alone, but the new disc is surprisingly good IMO--give it a chance."
A1FDMP7I0IFF38,B00ITAQ4DA,5.0,"I don't think it is as good as Trouble or God Willing, but his voice is still right on the money. It is wonderful music but to me does not have the energy of some of his earlier albums."
ACTEAPEPGDV8G,B00ITAQ4DA,4.0,"I like Ray LaMontagne's voice and his musical style, but this one came out of nowhere.  It's not anything like what I expected.  Very well done, but the songs are sort of Sixties psychedelic folk.  I have to give him credit for doing such a good job with the material he had, and the production is great, but it's not what I had in mind.  Here's hoping he goes back to his roots next time."
A2JLBZPK3GEIIO,B00ITAQ4DA,4.0,Not one of his best efforts.
A2GDNJJ496Q7LO,B00ITAQ4DA,4.0,"There are two type of listeners for this album. Those of us over 55 years of age that remember the psychedelic sounds and weaving melodies of the 1960's. We connect to music that harkens back to the day and cherish attempts at re-living that era. Then there are those who don't really understand or like the weird crap that us hippies were doing (no fault of yours for being younger). It is not always easy to listen to music that has competing melodies and vocal lines, one giving away to the next. Distorted guitars played against a bright chimes and delicate keyboard accents. The fact that people my age love an artist who's audience is closer to wearing baby diapers than Depends is a statement in itself. This music defines a musical period without being from that period. As for the songs, LAVENDER is the most intricately written song I have heard from Mr. LaMontagne, yet it is produced in a simple flavor that reminds one of the Youngbloods or Arthur Lee and Love. AIRWAVES sounds like Jason Mraz, who sounds like J.J. Cale who sounds like, you get the point, it is soothingly sexy. I even hear the Strawberry Alarm Clock in PICK UP A GUN, amazing. I can hear a young Mick Jagger singing JULIA, it's that retro. Speaking of the Stones, NO OTHER WAY has a DANDELION feel to it with the descending verse and then you have the break in the middle that sounds like the Association or one of those male harmony bands of the 60s. As for the title track, how can you not walk down the street singing &#34;I want you, be my girl&#34;, catchy stuff Ray. DRIVE IN MOVIES touches on Neil Young, Night Moves by Seeger, Poco and then out of nowhere Ray writes a little hook reminiscent of LIKE A ROLLING STONE by Dylan, from the 60's (of course) and tries to sneak it in there. The influence is everywhere and I love it."
A16MZL9N052I38,B00ITAQ4DA,4.0,"And not even seventies. The sixties, when Pink Floyd was busting out, and, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan and Motown ruled the airwaves. Supernova mostly sounds like the first three: wonderful melodies, chord changes that seem so--sixties--and solos that are groovy. Just the first few measures of 'Lavender' and the listener knows they've been teleported back to bellbottoms and flowery shirts. And Airwaves is like Bill Withers, and 'She's the One' is like the Yardbirds....and it goes on.This album is no doubt a big shock to listeners who enjoyed Ray's homage to Americana in 'God Willin', but it's pretty clear by now that Ray does not sit still.The sound quality of the vinyl is excellent. Enveloping."
A1EZ3YVG04FY1P,B00ITAQ4DA,1.0,"Ray...Ray...Ray...What were you thinking?This has got to be what happens when you are trying to be Mr. NiceGuy and turn over control to someone who has no appreciation for what/who you are all about. (I pray that's what happened) I mean really, at least try to stay in the same genre. Have you not listened to the singer/songwriters who have come before you and who you have been compared to? Why go this far off track and reach back to the worst &#34;B&#34; side, 60s, trash for influences? It's so disappointing. Please get back to the soulful, sweet sounds you have lifted us with. Maybe lose the creme colored, high-buttoned sweater too? What's goin' on? Peace..really...peace!"
A23H55I029WWYN,B00IU5DYAA,2.0,I love every other album that I have bought by Skrillex but this one is definitely lacking. I am not at all impressed with this album. Not even one track sticks out as good.
ARQR3GG2YUWO8,B00IU5DYAA,3.0,"Really disappointing. Stick to the first 2 albums if you want that sweet ,sweet bass. This is straight up white bread electronica.Ok so I have listened to this cd a few more times and it's growing on me. The last time was on my living room system. Which is ok for movies as it is 5.1 , and plays clean and loud. Put the Integra on all channel and turned it up a bit . Kinda fun. Still sounds like it was mixed by his cousin, and not \"The Skrillix\".So if you've been listening to this on mp3, and smaller systems at lower volumes, try it on a full sized system and give it a little gas. It's no \"scary Monsters...\" but its not terrible either."
AHPSKTUNSDO2T,B00IU6HQBW,1.0,"This second ep coming from one of my fav bands, disappoints like the first ep. Not one original sound comes from this recording, Down has run its corse,period. Pepper Keenan is wasting his time with Anselmo's N.O. band. I cant take it anymore, Phil, you have let me down for the last time, the first two Down lp's were solid, the third was ok, but now, with two eps released, and nothing comes from either one, well, its time we parted ways. Corrosion of Conformity is still kicking ass without Pep. but would be even better with him, as far as Phil goes, I love him to death, but this project has run its course, Down."
A1SOVSOKCKJMBC,B00IUA5FC0,5.0,What a great score!  It gives me the creeps listening to &#34;How Was She&#34; while I am moved to emotion as I hear the heartfelt &#34;Hope (Xavier's Theme).  This soundtrack has it all and if you have seen the film all you need do is put this album on and Maestro Ottman will conjure up images of our valiant heroes defending the freedoms of Mutants and Regular People alike.
APH8QRFD35QNE,B00IUKPIXG,5.0,"Merrill Garbus (tUnE-yArDs' creator) visited Africa before releasing the album before this one (Whokill), and the beats and instrumentation on that CD were heavily influenced by those sounds. Nikki Nack's use of percussion continues to be a key style element, along with jagged rhythms, fascinating melodies and great vocals. She can belt out a tune like a blues singer! This album is fresh, creative, innovative. I love it."
A10H24TDLK2VDP,B00IUKPIXG,4.0,"I saw the Tune-Yards on Jimmy Fallon, playing with The Roots. The music is quirky and extremely inventive. It can be difficult but it is always entertaining. Not your typical band."
A2N486A7AD3H6K,B00IUOH02E,4.0,"Sean and Charlotte have created a very enjoyable &#34;Beatle-esque&#34; album.  Sean sounds so much like John, which makes it all the better.  Any Beatles fan would be very pleased to have this in his or her music library."
A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,B00IV5EN7W,5.0,"Only in recent years have I come to realize just how significant Harvey Mason is to the progression of jazz-funk on through \"chill\" and into the modern expansive era of the jazz idiom. As a drummer,being a band leader was an inevitability because of that age old tradition of the drummer leading the marching band during the ragtime era-or even as a communicative instrument in Africa. Having been a founding member of Bob James' 90's era super group Fourplay,Harvey has continued the occasional solo and ongoing session work as he had always done. Realizing the nature of his talent as a musician of many musical colors,Harvey put together a new group called Chameleon which consisted of himself,sax player Kamasi Washington, keyboardist Corey King,Jimmy Haslip on bass and classic Headhunters era percussion Bill Summers in the mix. This album serves both as a Harvey Mason release and an introduction to the new band as well.\"Black Frost\" takes Bob James' composition into a place where all of the instrumentation revolves around Mason's spiraling drum sound. Bobby Hutcherson's \"Mantara\" gives a similarly involved workout to a very complex yet compelling melody. \"If I Ever Lose This Heaven\",long associated with Quincy Jones funkiest years has a single vocalist for this occasion in the somewhat more contemporary Chris Turner. \"Looking Back\" and especially \"Mase's Theme\" are both just over one minute interludes that showcase a full on return to the driving,clavinet driven Headhunters style of jazz funk while Patrice Rushen's \"Before The Dawn\" allows for the band and Harvey to groove in a softer manner belying the intensity of the dynamic composition.  Donald Byrd's \"Places And Spaces\",featuring vocals from Corey King again focuses on the spiritual,avante garde end of the jazz-funk genre. The album concludes with a re-arranged version of Herbie Hancock's title song-one which emphasized the hindewhu effect more than the synth bass of the original. The bonus number (several tracks later \"Looking Forward (Breaking Bad)\" is a lively full band arrangement with an uptempo rhythm.Overall this music is not as easy to pin down as the virtues of Mason and his intention would make it out to be. Of course the same thing could apply to the Headhunters as well. Though they were rather clearly based in funk at the core. This album is quite different at the base. The sound doesn't have the phat bass lines and breaks that are essential to hard funk. Nor does it have that breezy,glossy studio overcoat that would commonly be found on a \"chill\" (once pejoratively referred to as smooth jazz) type of album either. What this does is provide a full musical picture that integrates elements of what Mason did in the Headhunters and his totally separate style forged in Fourplay. So this is sort of a hybrid sound to a degree. At the same time,a live band and very jazzy (on the fusion end) sound is emphasized. That being said,the music here successfully bridges one generation of jazz fusion with another that has the feeling of a pair of paternal mentors leading their musical children and cousins. The musical unity creates a strong and uniquely grooving sound on this album and it is more than a welcomed addition to Mason's vast and diverse musical catalog."
A2DG8I57ZCLJTO,B00IVLRAJE,5.0,"I just listened to this twice and came away very impressed. There is a good mix of songs on here and they are all done very well. This album rocks harder than I expected and there are some good slow songs as well. Overall, I liked listening to this more than Stryper's newest album Hell to Pay. While good, that album just didn't have the variety of songs that I like in my albums. It was as though they were trying too hard to do too much of the same stuff. Great album by Sweet here. Definitely worth the purchase."
A2KT3DANHRTI38,B00IVLRAJE,5.0,"Nice job!Pre-ordered from amazon and got it the day it was released. Opened it up, and played it on my way to the MVP ceremony for Kevin Durant here in OKC. First track is my favorite, and it is heavy. The rest of the songs are your typical Michael Sweet songs. Great voice, catchy chorus, and uplifting lyrics. I have to admit, the only song I don't really care for is the ballad. I have listened to the whole album 4x, and its the only song on the album I don't like as much. The rest of the album in my opinion is really good.I wouldn't hesitate to buy this album!There are a few surprises on this album too. I won't ruin it for you, but its a totally different musical style. Its nice that he has the freedom to try different styles that he can't really pull off with Stryper.Michael Sweet continues to put out some great music. I'm so thankful he is still putting great stuff out there for us to listen to. As long as he's making music, I will continue to buy it!"
A5FBFM4F5YNWP,B00IW4SBT8,4.0,"This is NOT your typical country music.  Instead it fuses today's harder edge southern rock sounds with up beat, &#34;open field&#34; lyrical messages about good times and having fun.  If you're looking for music that gets you up off your ass, then this offering from Brantley Gilbert is a great one to start with.  You will be fist pumpin' and moving your feet in no time at all.  Enjoy!"
A2WIT5OFLTH9JM,B00IWS73PW,5.0,Once again Mi amigo Carlos produces music with others that makes you want to smile and get up and move! Corazon is awesome to say the least great music Latino music and other groos stuff just makes you go wild! Mi Gusta mucho por la musica muy bueno!
A6AOLZK82A67C,B00IWS73PW,5.0,i enjoy getting his albums every year. this one is a great one to get if you like santana and his albums.
A2JKPVK7FA712W,B00IWS73PW,4.0,"I like the songs I have Heard on this &aacute;lbum, the first 5 or 6. I remember Abraxas, Santana III, Caravaserai, ect... Those are my favorite albums by Santana. If you are a fan of his and don't know the 1st 6 albums the group put out, by all meams get them and you will hear a very different side of Santana. As a musician, I think I understand the direction that Santana is going in these days. Even the most diehard musicians have to pay the bills and doing that through music is not easy. It makes you respect John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Thelonious Monk all the more. But I don't knock Carlos, in fact he wanted to put out a Spanish language &aacute;lbum and that's exactly what he did. I'm Hispanic and the music sometimes can be very pop music sounding. To his credit, the music is pleasant and uplifting at least it is to me. From the standpoint of a pop music &aacute;lbum with a strong latino flavor I think it is a good &aacute;lbum. However, if you want to compare this &aacute;lbum with Caravanserai, es harina de otro costal. To compare this with an &aacute;lbum like Welcome is like comparing  a baseball bat to a frisbee. I think now that Santana will never make another &aacute;lbum like Abraxas. Hey,  the guitars are dffferent, some of the musicians he played with are no longer with us and more importantly it's a different point and time and yesterday is gone. Forever. If you like this &aacute;lbum cool, if you don't I have no problem with that particularly if your reference point is Santana of the 1960's and 1970's."
A1H21EUOI2ORZA,B00IWS73PW,5.0,At his best!!!!
A3U5P5LQYDHY0S,B00IXLQJ2G,3.0,This project is just ok. I am not a fan of the today country sound but I usually like Miranda stuff. There are a few really good songs but for the most part the rest are OK or just suck. I would pick the songs you like and buy just them
AZXP46IB63PU8,B00IXLQJ2G,5.0,"Great music, a great voice"
A22N03OBDDVSEB,B00IXLQJ2G,4.0,"Miranda Lambert's 5th studio album \"Platinum\", continues her winning streak on albums, she hasn't released a clunker yet.  The Texas spark plug only had 1 misstep on this release in my opinion, the collaboration with Carrie Underwood \"Somethin' Bad\", which will go top 5 none the less . Tunes that get the 5 star treatment are, \"Girls\", \"Little Red Wagon\", \"Priscilla\", \"Automatic\", the old Bob Wells style country of \"All That's Left\", written by Tom T. Hall, \"Holding On To You\", Two Rings Shy\", \"Hard Staying Sober\" and \"Old cuss word here\" and \"Bathroom Sink\".  A solid country album, Blake should feel proud of his wife again!No need for any publicity stunts with other artists like Mrs. Underwood again, Miranda's fine on her own."
A1VL282XIRMEEQ,B00IXLQJ2G,5.0,"Miranda Lambert's new album, &#34;Platinum,&#34; is a recommended buy a must-buy for today's country fans--it's sure to collect a CMAs and Grammys. While putting together a string of competent country albums, Lambert has become a modern country icon who can summon the classic Nashville sounds of the mid-twentieth century while providing her own unique twists and updates. Her super-group side project, Pistol Annies, is in the same vein. &#34;Platinum,&#34; coming from a maturing Lambert, is a collection of hardworking country girl anthems featuring straightforward country with flourishes of rock and, occasionally, altrock. Lyrically Lambert is in fine form delivering poignant commentary on the plight of women who would actually be a bit older than she--her commentary on graying hair and gravity weighing on body parts not being the top concerns of a thirty year-old. As usual, Lambert continues to deliver meaty albums with &#34;Platinum&#34; weighing in at 16 tracks. Out of seven top tracks, &#34;Two Rings Shy&#34; gets the best track designation for marrying insightful lyrics with classic country sounds churned through circus music rhythms and stylings. &#34;Gravity Is A Bitch&#34; is another gem featuring sly commentary set against old-timey country. The title track is a thoroughly modern country song that may have cross-over appeal to rock fans."
A19KM47NSMWZAH,B00IXLQJ2G,5.0,Love the music
A2ZF5D0KM2AWGU,B00IYLX4NC,5.0,"If you are a true Nazareth fan you will love this album.  They have some of their old sound with a mixture of new sound.  So enjoy it if you again are a true fan, because this will most likely be their last."
A3M4ZMI0RRDQC,B00IZ4YK9U,5.0,"From the masters of metal behind Soulfly/ Sepultura, Mars volta, Mastodon and The Dillinger Escape Plan, comes ABSOLUTE METAL MAYHEM! This album is crushing...CRUSHING!"
A162X4F0IR4XG4,B00IZ4YK9U,5.0,This is the first supergroup that lived up to the hype. This album is a perfect blend of personalities.Just plain fun. It's everything that's awesome about metal. I hope they tour.
AR6BY09YI6NXT,B00IZ4YK9U,5.0,"An all-star lineup superband that from the start peels the paint off the walls and then tears the house down! The music is an onslaught of a genius mixture of screamo, metal, thrash, & doom. You wouldn't think a trio of different style vocals would work but this does in a big way. On wings of feather and wax, melting my marrow, & snakes of jehovah are just a few standouts on this epic collaboration"
A1Z2KXRBI9I619,B00IZDWZ6Q,5.0,This is Night Rangers best album ever. All the signature riffs & vocals are here. The title track starts things out with a bang. And they never let up on the rest of the album. It's a must buy if your a Night Ranger fan.

Highlights are &#34;Rollin' On&#34;, &#34;St. Bartholomew&#34;, &#34;Don't Even Know Your Name&#34; (Best Buy Bonus Song), &#34;Knock Knock Never Stop&#34;, &#34;High Road&#34;, and &#34;Mountain Song&#34; (Deluxe Edition Bonus Song).This album is just as good, if not better, than &#34;Somewhere In California&#34;.  Of course, I like every Night Ranger album, but I think the albums since they've reunited are better than their first 5 albums.I recommend this album to any Night Ranger fan or any 80s rock fan. It definitely rocks!"
A1ZMGV3E10PPZA,B00IZDWZ6Q,5.0,"This is Night Ranger in their latest groove and doing a good job.  Like the first four albums sound very similar then the next few kind of all had a certain feel, this one too has gone into a new groove.  It has hints of the first four.  The ballads are nice and the rocking songs rock just like you expect.  I don't quite like it as much as Somewhere in California but I not only bought the digital music to get the pre-releases but have just ordered the DVD and CD to get the liner notes and see the boys doing the work.  I hope they have a good tour.  The last tour really looked neat on all the videos that I saw of it.  I thought a few of the songs on this album had a Damn Yankees feel to them and wondered if Tommy Shaw was involved and like always - the stupid digital copies didn't have the composer information on them.  What is up with that?  It just makes me really mad.Favorite cuts:  St. Bartholomew has a really great introduction and reminds me of something off of the Seven album but only kicked up and sped up a hundred miles.  Seven is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  Only for You is also reminiscent of one of the later ballads from the second more thoughtful cycle of Night Ranger that a lot of people didn't quite appreciate but this is the best ballad on the album in my opinion.  I just paid for the music twice if that tells you anything about how I felt about this effort.  I give it a 5 though it isn't a five like I gave Somewhere in California but awfully close!  I hope they put another album out next year!General Rant not about Night Ranger in particular:  Composers need to get some respect.  I know Jack Blades probably wrote every song on it and I know his son helped with one of the pre-releases but still - why do I have to go to Wikipedia to get that information?  It should be able to be seen in the digital section.  Also, when I try to listen to the songs on Amazon, the songs don't play right or stop at a single song and I have to refresh my screen to listen to them so I end up buying my digital music on iTunes if the price is within a buck difference.  Amazon needs to do a better job promoting hard rock."
A32HECAPPBIKD2,B00IZDWZ6Q,5.0,"Well the boys are back. After a few weeks of releases (High Road, I'm Coming Home, and Knock Knock Never Stop) we finally got the new CD landed on Tuesday! I've listened several times and I have to say this is an instant classic in my book. The overall sound is classic Night Ranger, with modern touches, a very mature approach to the composition, and even some throw back elements. Overall, I'd give this 6 stars!The tracks:High Road - Classic feel in the vein of When You Close Your Eyes. Jack is in great voice on this one, the guitar solo is killer, and this is very well written, composed and performed track. I feel that rock radio could love this if they'd give it a chance. I know classic rock stations are spinning it, and the response has to be outstanding. I have to say this is probably one of the best new tracks since the band reformed in 1996.Knock Knock Never Stop - Great rocker with an anthem feel to it. Just typical straight ahead amazing music from beginning to end. Jack once again is in great voice, as is Kelly on this dual lead vocal track. Hard to believe that Jack just turned 60 years old. The guitar work on this track is very intricate, and the keyboards are ever present. Eric Levy has an Alan Fitzgerald way of holding the song together without you even realizing he is there. Again great solo on guitar. One small criticism, I almost feel this should have been the closing track, I think it would have book ended this CD perfectly with High Road.Rollin' On - How these guys can continue to find a ways to make quality straight ahead rockers like this one are beyond me. Just looking at the last 3 albums including this one they've had so many quality straight ahead rockers its unfathomable. I would love to hear all of them live. This one has a great live feel to it, and Jack's vocals take a bit of a different approach on the verse. The chorus is huge with the hey-hey-yeah backing vocals, and gives this one an anthem feel as well. Again so much intricate guitar work here. Modern bands need to take notice! Good music is more than chords!! Oh and a keyboard solo! TOO AWESOME!Don't Live Here Anymore - One of the things I've noticed on this CD is the Biblical references. This one includes several, but also has an overall redemptive theme. It almost makes me wonder if Brad, Jack or Kelly found religion since Somewhere In California. This song is more serious than the first 3 tracks, and I love how they've blended verse and chorus in this one to mix up composition from the normal verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, bridge, chorus, chorus, chorus format. Not that it isn't a winning formula but it is nice to see it changed up and this one does. Plus the combination of keyboards, piano, and acoustic guitar make for a wonderful feel to this track. Kelly's voice shows no signs of his 62 year old self! Man he can still blow! This one also has the throwback keyboards in the middle, great solo, and Jack singing the bridge. The tempo change near the end with the musical outro leading to Kelly's closing lyrics gives this one a Rain That's Crashing Down/Night Ranger (the song) feel. This is just a solid track that should get some airplay. A song like this (and Rain from Big Life and Night Ranger (the song) from Dawn Patrol) deserves a bigger audience. One of my favorites on this CD!I'm Coming Home - Just when you thought the rockers couldn't continue with high quality, this one blows you away! The guitar intro seems a bit out of place, but I am sure it was a riff that Brad had to find a place for, because it is a great riff. But then this track kicks in with energy, great chord changes, and Kelly singing his butt off again. This is classic Night Ranger, with great vocal arrangements, perfectly placed guitar finger technique, and the dual guitars sound incredible. I am running out of accolades but each of these tracks so far just stands on its own so well. Jack sings the bridge again on this one. And the solo is killer. Quintessential Night Ranger!X Generation - This one is a bit different, but still a good straight ahead rocker. Some of the best lyrics on the record, they just fit together so well. Of course, that is a Jack specialty and why he is highly sought for song writing. Probably one of the more modern sounding tracks on the CD. Kind of in the theme of Rockstar from Hole In The Sun, yet so many classic elements too, all blended with a genius touch. Dual lead vocals again. Oh and the guitar! I dare you to find a more virtuoso band in existence right now.  This track, and the entire CD, are just a guitar clinic. Brad Gillis and Joel Hoekstra deserve so many accolades that they don't receive, so underrated. Eric again with a great under current here. 6 tracks in and you are wondering what else they could do!Only For You Only - Notice anything missing so far? Even Don't Live Hear Anymore is less a ballad as it is a mid-tempo rocker. (You could argue it has ballad tendencies.) But what Night Ranger CD would be complete without a full on ballad? Every release from Dawn Patrol forward has had one. Well here is High Road's, and it is a good one. Jack's vocals are some of his best since the 80s! Seriously, he nails this one. and shows a range that will surprise some people. Great verse leads to a mid-tempo chorus that is awesome! Then comes back down for verse 2, with Jack continuing the great vocal range, leading into the chorus. Then to a great bridge, and an incredible solo that has a Queen quality to it (that is a good thing). Just a great power ballad. Gives Forever All Over Again a run for its money as best since the mid-90s reunion.Hang On - Right back into a mid-tempo rocker. This is another solid track! Kelly is in great form, classic Night Ranger backing vocals. This one has a really classic Night Ranger sound and feel to it. This one would fit in on any of their first 5 albums. Seriously, this is just an incredible track. The guitar solo may be my favorite on the whole album. Guys, I know I sound like a broken record, but seriously, each of these tracks are really really good.St. Bartholomew - Let me start by saying this is heaviest track on the album. The guitar sound here is very heavy. And I love the intro to the song. First vocals don't start until 47 seconds in! And it has a really cool duet vocal that fits perfectly with the heavy verse, the chorus actually lightens up, and is really big with intricate vocal arrangements. Once again, there are biblical themes here \"everyone has a cross to bear\". The chorus has an incredible quality to it, I could see that blasting as I ride down the road with the windows down. Another great dual guitar solo. Brad and Joel continue to outdo themselves. Solid track from beginning to end.Brothers - The most different track on the album. Kind of a Shaw Blades feel to it with Kelly on vocals, though Jack shares lead vocals. Almost a Beatle like quality, which isn't surprising considering their affinity for The Beatles. Very religious in theme: \"roll away the stone\". \"Turn the water to wine.\" \"Is it wrong to feel this way?\" Not to mention the religious aspects of brotherhood and sisterhood. That's three tracks with overtly religious themes. However, this song is very well put together. Like I said it has that Shaw Blades feel could have fit right in on My Hallucination. The tempo change at the end is outstanding. Understated musically, but solid in its own right.L.A. No Name - Instrumental. That's right Night Ranger finally did an all instrumental track. Very good catchy, kind of a Brad Gillis on Alligator feel to it. Glad I have this track! (It kind of hearkens to the instrumental track near the end of Napoleon Dynamite!)Overall, an amazing effort from one the best, most underrated, incredibly talented rock bands in history! A natural next step from the incredible Somewhere In California album. The fact this won't get the exposure it so deserves is sad, but for diehards like myself, and maybe some new fans through the limited airplay they will get, this is a must have CD! And you have to wonder how many more we will get with some of the guys cresting 60 years of age, and a couple others on the cusp. So enjoy for all its good ol' American rock n roll awesomeness!*****"
AGOIS4LC6AY9I,B00J0H0Z68,1.0,"Loved the first album, Wounded Rhymes. I have no idea what she was thinking on this album. It is so boring I'd rather listen to a corpse. Seriously sample it before you blindly buy it and force yourself to like it because you paid $10. She has definitely jumped the shark here."
A31OPSNAXK3UA7,B00J0LGZK4,5.0,Big fan since his Rainbow days and of course Black Sabbath Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules after that but his Holy Diver albumwas the one that broke Dio to the mainstream and his best solo album. His late 80's early 90's albums were good not great. Isaw him on this tour in New Orleans and in Texas and it was a great show. Nice to hear a few good songs off the StrangeHighways album which was really HEAVY sound for DIO back then. His later albums like Killing the Dragon was much betterand back to his original sound. This show show even though DIO wasn't as big he still had that golden Voice and a great bandto back him up. It's not as good as the Holy Diver live cd/dvd which I highly recommend but it's worth having just the same.It's ashame Ronnie is no longer with us but his voice and music will live on forever in the history of rock and roll.
A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B00J0YAEXA,5.0,"If you're anything like me, you think the release of a new Agalloch album should be a national holiday.  New full-lengths don't come too often, and when they do, they're pretty much genius.  If any of their albums got a less-than-overwhelming response, it was the last one, \"Marrow of the Spirit.\"  That one had a more metal approach than any of their material since 1997's \"From Which of This Oak,\" with more frequent black metal vocals and even blast beats, which was new for Agalloch.  The folk and alt-rock sections also seemed more basic in places, not quite as lush as on the previous albums.  I personally love \"Marrow\" as much as anything the band has done, but it took longer than usual for some to fully embrace it.  This new album, I believe, will instantly please anyone who's ever been an Agalloch fan.  \"The Serpent and the Sphere\" combines elements of all four of their previous albums, but mostly the first three.  Many times throughout the CD, I hear parts that remind me of \"Pale Folklore\" and \"The Mantle,\" but probably more so than the other two, \"Ashes Against the Grain.\"Every song here is broad and sweeping in scope, presenting beautifully crisp alt-rock guitar licks intertwined with folk and various styles of metal, with the exception of the three enchanting, elegant acoustic pieces sprinkled into the mix.  \"Serpent\" offers some of the most fun Agalloch songs to listen to in many years, bringing a fair amount of the rocking-out from the first two albums back into their sound, with plenty of brooding doom metal to up the ante.  They even play some of the melodic black metal akin to their earliest material on \"The Astral Dialogue\" and in a few other spots. So far, my favorite track on the album is \"Dark Matter Gods,\" an eight-plus minute amazing journey through all of Agalloch's diverse array of talents.  The only element missing from the old days is Haughm's clean vocals, but he does still do the droning, chant-like vocal melodies, with a lot more whispering than before.  For me, it's all good where the vocals are concerned.  The music on this track is enthralling.  The songs are all conceptually tied together through celestial references and imagery (the word \"celestial\" even makes its way into one of the song titles).  It's an interesting route for a band known for its focus on all things nature, but a logical extension seeing how they've thoroughly covered earthbound nature over the course of four albums and numerous EP's.Needless to say, I've been anxiously awaiting this one for a few years, with only the \"Faustian Echoes\" EP to whet my appetite for more Agalloch.  Clocking in at just under an hour and with songs that are already making their way onto my favorite list for this band, I couldn't be much happier with \"The Serpent and the Sphere.\"Since Amazon doesn't have one, here's a track list:1.  Birth and Death of the Pillars of Creation  (10:27)2.  (Serpens Caput)  (3:06)3.  The Astral Dialogue  (5:11)4.  Dark Matter Gods  (8:35)5.  Celestial Effigy  (6:58)6.  Cor Serpentis (The Sphere)  (2:58)7.  Vales Beyond Dimension  (6:47)8.  Plateau of the Ages  (12:25)9.  (Serpens Cauda)  (3:11)"
A3DXAN3QOSDH7M,B00J110BGW,5.0,"wow Ben and his Mother can harmonize.  This cd reminds me of James Taylor type &#34;folkie&#34; sound,  different and I enjoy it."
A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B00J146XO8,2.0,"When Hans Zimmer was announced for Amazing Spider-Man 2, it was a \"What the eff?\" moment not unsimilar to the moment you realised Zimmer was doing Man Of Steel. How in the world was he going to fit in with the teenage-heavy, lighthearted, colourful world of Spider-Man, if he couldn't even infuse Superman with heroism? Just consider for a minute who did these films so far: Danny Elfman, Christopher Young and James Horner, whose works rank arguably amongst the best superhero scores ever written. So, if those scores were perfect, and you consider their tone, you will be hard pressed to think of a composer whose style is more different from the concept than Hans Zimmer.So Zimmer, probably realising that, did what he always does: he turned to somebody else. The cover says \"Magnificent Six\", but upon closer inspection, including the usual bunch of ghost writers, no less than 15 people wrote this score.In this case, it's not even like Zimmer wrote the music, and had Williams, Marr and co perform it, he had them do their own music. Hans Zimmer stresses the point that he went and made this one different from his usual scores. The question then is: where?Don't be fooled by the contributions of Marr and the other muppets, the actual contributions Zimmer makes rarely leave his comfort zone. Just because there is a woodwind motif floating underneath the electronic droning occasionally does not mean it's worthy of gasps and screams of awe. The use of a trumpet for the hero theme is indeed revolutionary for Zimmer these days (and isn't this itself rather sad?), but the sound of it is tacky and corny, and not in a good \"comic book\" way. It's a lame Copland imitation, which in no way captures the essence of the character, and the ridiculously nasal tone of the trumpet players, plus probably some electronic tweakiing, make even this theme sound sampled. It's like Zimmer said \"okay, let me do this hero theme\" without ever really questioning its function in the film. He must have realised its hokey tone and its uselessness at some point though, since it barely appears on album and in the film.Which leads to another major fault with this score, and that is its main identity. Elfman's scores, Horner's score, they were full of musical representations of Spider-Man and its alter ego Peter Parker, and his relationship with MJ/Gwen. This gave these scores a superhero identity. Zimmer, however, focuses on the villain(s), and that makes TASM 2 neither more pleasurable, nor more listenable, nor does it justice to the requirements of the film. It just adds to my solidified opinion, that Zimmer pays little attention to the actual film these days, and does little actual scoring, meaning scoring to picture, anymore. He cooked up a theme for Jamie Foxx's Electro that must have sprung from the same line of thought that came up with Bane's chanting for Dark Knight Rises, but this time with, you guessed it, buzzing sound effects. So, again, totally original, right? Voices whisper english lyrics with such ingenius lines as: \"He lied to me, he shot at me, fragility, electricity, he's dead to me, can't ignore the paranoia.\" In the film, this is distracting. On album, it makes you cringe.Staying firmly in this \"screw the film\" mindset, the heart of the movie, Peter's sweet relationship with Gwen, is quickly dealt with in the form of emotionally cold, half-assed themes for piano and some woodwinds, and even these are washed out by droning bass. Furthermore, Peter's friendship with Harry, let alone the Goblin itself, is barely touched upon at all.You know, you can analyse a score in great depth, you can talk about thematic implementations, instrumentations, performance, mix, but it all comes down to listenability. And if you find it rousing, or intelligent, or in any way satisfying to have a low choir whisper such hilarious and laughable lyrics into you ear, well, bless you, but I find this score unlistenable for entertainment, and two CDs full of it borders on physical injury. I mean, honestly, who can listen to the 13 minute Electro Suite without ear or brain damage? I forced myself through this album once, in addition to having seen the film, and I have as much desire to revisit this as I have the urge to play anything from Man Of Steel again.From beginning to end, from the album cover, over the music, to the comments about the score and the hype surrounding it, it is apparent that the emphasis in the music was never, ever on the characters and the film, but on \"does this sound cool?\", the production and marketing. And so, having now promoted himself to the incredible trifactor of scoring Batman, Superman and Spider-Man, anticipated with much dread is the comparison to his predecessors, namely Williams, Elfman and Horner. Arguably, you can't compare these four, as their styles are wildy different, but what you can compare is how they managed to capture the heart and essence of the characters and their films. Williams hit it out of the park, Elfman produced two classics (Batman and Spider-Man), and Horner's effort, while not iconic, is still heartfelt and real.With Zimmer, he applied the same damn approach to all three characters, with Superman being the most massive misstep. That the music for Batman is still somewhat in tone with the character is a result of the character being in tone with the music, not the other way around.The only thing raising the rating to two stars instead of one is the fact that TASM 2 makes a feeble effort to differentiate itself from Zimmer's other superhero rapings. But that is due to Williams, Marr and co, not Zimmer. With an army of ghost writers, who the hell knows what he did? At this point, you probably wouldn't even know the difference."
A1PJ9EVVYGW7JA,B00J2AU8PQ,5.0,"I heard the first cut from this collection of music on my favorite radio station, WNCW on the internet and immediately ordered it online. It has become my &#34;new favorite&#34; and I'm eagerly awaiting Volume # 2 ... This CD get high marks from this reviewer."
ATI5PFF9DTGX1,B00J2PQXQY,3.0,"Hardcore fans will need this for the inclusion of the unreleased demo &#34;Reputation&#34; and some live tracks from recent tours.  Casual fans would be better off buying the single disc &#34;The Very Best Of KISS&#34; or &#34;KISS Gold.&#34;  This compilation includes things like the demo version of &#34;God Of Thunder&#34; with Paul Stanley on vocals in place of the album version that features Gene Simmons on lead vocals.  Decent overview of their career, but not as comprehensive as it should be for newer fans."
A20JX4DJDU67DE,B00J2PQXQY,1.0,"This is the same crap they have been selling for years,some of these songs are already on over 7 CDs they already put out! Hey Gene and Paul! Don't you have enough money yet? This release is a simple case of greed and the fans are getting sick of it as you can tell by the sales..........Enough kiss merchandise already! Enough is enough!"
A2VX9ZNX846BY7,B00J2T18MY,5.0,"It is an amazing tribute to the singers, instrumentalists, archivists, those who reconstructed it, to Mr. Weill and Mr. Nash.  A long overdue recording.  Bravo!"
A1UF66B9W0A8NA,B00J3FORJ8,1.0,"I really wanted to like this as I have everything else he has ever done. It is almost impossible to get through the first three tracks without forwarding the disc. Perhaps I should give it another chance but I couldn't imagine what he was thinking. Remember when Bowie came out with Tin Machine and to quote Morrissey &#34;a nation turns it's back and gags,&#34; well that is how it feels or more and less sounds, sorry, just all wrong for so many reasons."
AF8VKB9DBBA3Z,B00J3FORJ8,5.0,"Miles and miles into a deep and dark career Peter Murphy has created his richest and most potent work to date with Lion.  He does in fact roar through this album and with a ferocity not heard since the days of Bauhaus - but better.  Peter's voice sounds incredible!  Every song finds him carrying off some of the coolest songs he has ever done with lift, speed and majesty.  The vocals are massive - searing, passionate and awe inspiring.  There is an overall murkiness to the mix which I could understand earning some detractors but it actually works to cloak the album in an overall opacity that makes it all the more intriguing.  You are aching to hear everything with greater clarity and crispness but being denied you find a more subtle and sublime satisfaction.  If ever a truly gothic album were made Lion is it -  par excellence."
A3RIX4Z8KCXIJM,B00J3FORJ8,5.0,"Dark, melodic, rhythmic, romantic, heavy, deep....Peter Murphy has taken all his years as an artist and brought them together to create the biggest roar in music in quite sometime.  This is some deep stuff with textures and layers I've never heard before.  Thank you Peter for this beautiful work of art....it's a masterpiece."
AIQ1BUSBGD9DQ,B00J3FORJ8,4.0,"&#34;Lion&#34; is an apt title: Murphy howls and growls and rages through the lyrics with an Iggy-like fire. This is not an album of a fading, greying elder; this is a shriek of power. Murphy's voice is actually becoming stronger with each new album (&#34;Ninth&#34; had its astonishing vocal moments as well), and he is capable of a snarl like a predator protecting his territory from an enemy. While recording this album, producer Youth forced Peter to compose quickly, on the fly, to capture Murphy's in-the-moment ingenuity. This was to keep the work from sounding too over-thought and brittle (and there are times when Murphy's past writings can suffer from forced sophistry--&#34;Dragnet Drag&#34;, I'm looking at you). That doesn't mean that haste shoved intellect to the side; you still get Peter's smart, cryptic lyrics, which are often composed more for the &#34;art&#34; of the wording than for the clarity of expression.There are flaws, but not many. &#34;Lion&#34; is assembled like a hammock, with strongest load-bearing tracks at the front and back, and with a dip in energy toward the middle. &#34;The Rose&#34; is, to be honest, a low-point ballad that seems bland against the stronger backdrop of other tracks.  A couple of lyrics seem forced and unworthy of Murphy (the forced rhyme &#34;In you I will confide&#34; is cringeworthy). It bothers me that in &#34;Eliza&#34;--a song supporting a woman healing from a painful past--Murphy interrupts his poem for her to indulge in sheer ego (&#34;The gift of my unlimited intelligence / I am unique / I'm a painter of the hearts I sing for...&#34; Yes, those are the words he sings in a song meant to be his tribute to someone ELSE). A few songs have meanings still unknowable to others except for Murphy himself (what is a &#34;Loctaine&#34;? Why is there a &#34;Ghost of Shokan Lake&#34;? Google yields no clues).Like any of Murphy's albums, you interpret it as much as you can, and just go with the rest. You let the cryptic lyrics just fly past, and enjoy the shockwave. Peter is Peter, a point he makes in his second song (&#34;I Am My Own Name,&#34; which is his declaration, &#34;Don't project your misguided imagery onto me.&#34;)As a fan, I find myself listening to &#34;Lion&#34; and thinking, &#34;Thank GOD Peter Murphy hasn't gone soft and slow, or dubstep, or techno, or retro!&#34; No, this is Murphy being strong. &#34;Lion&#34; continues &#34;Ninth&#34;s trajectory, and indicates that Peter is still full of inspiration and has continued exciting work still to come."
A2JN3BL25PDBY4,B00J3V97NS,5.0,"This album doesn't have as much genre/style variety as her first album, but it is a very solid offering.  Her music befuddles and confuses critics who habitually have to 'categorize' artists with others- Lindsey is pretty close to being a genre of her own making.  I am sure she will continue to do well- she is a force of music, video and personality, which makes for a good long career.  Shatter Me and Beyond the Veil are the two early videos, so fans are more familiar with them, however Master of Tides and Ascendance are also very strong.  As premature as this sounds- I hope her third album comes quickly and has some more dub step influence the way her first album did."
A1PTVO34MGZZFH,B00J3V97NS,5.0,"I heard a song off of her first album on my little brother's pandora account, and it mesmerized me, utterly spellbinding. I don't like dub step, or techno, or electronica, but I love violins, and she is very talented. this album actually has a feat with Lizzie Hale from Halestorm, and its just marvelous. buy this album, i mean it."
A1EG1SW4UA7RS4,B00J3V97NS,5.0,"Ms Lindsey Stirling is a fantastic, accomplished and talented dancer/ classical violinist.  Lindsey and her bandmates have created another landmark album,  From Beyond The Veil, all the way to Master of Tides, each track weaves intricate symphonies that will crack the shell of mediocre, listless music.  Her brilliant, enigmatic and masterful touch stays with you throughout the entire album.  This is pure, honest to goodness feel good music, there's no blurred messages.  Well, each track doesn't have vocals aside from the occasional chorus. Don't let that be an obstacle from enjoying this album because each song takes you on a journey.  From the title track, &#34;Shatter Me&#34; featuring the guest vocals of Lzzy Hale from the band &#34;Halestorm, her range and passion showcased on this spectacular song is not to be missed.  I wish I could listen to this song at work.  Shatter Me cries out against the shrill, defeated mediocre life of settling for less, We all can relate to Ms. Hale and Lindsey's message to be live freely without creative constraints.  It's timely, and just a flat-out incredible song.  Check out the video on Youtube.  Another not to be missed track on the album for me is &#34;Heist&#34;.  Lindsey uses her gift beautifully all throughout this album.  it's not to be missed.  I made sure I secured my pre-order, I thank Ms. Stirling and company for defying expectations and for shattering the misconception that classical music has to be low tempo and boring.  I'm really looking forward to seeing her in concert.  Rock on Lindsey!"
A22Z2FFANY9UD7,B00J3V97NS,5.0,This music is very relaxing and can put you in an uplifting mood.Highly recommend this CD. It's Great!  Lindsey has interesting videos also.
A1GAZ76MO36C9J,B00J4D9X1G,5.0,CD NOW never disappoints!
A2V8PM4FL3YGE5,B00J4D9X1G,5.0,"I ordered this (Single Version) CD, from Amazon, on May 14, 2014.  And I rec'd it on May 20, 2014 & I'm quite happy w/ it.  Unfortunately, FIVE of these songs have now fallen off the American Top 40 Countdown. I'd like to offer my review & opinions of ALL songs as follows:1.  \"Happy\"...I really love this song & I WOULDN'T be @ all surprised if it is the #1 song on the 2014 Year End Countdown. I remember THIS song being performed, by Pharrell, on Sunday, March 2, 2014 on The Oscars.2.  \"Dark Horse\"...I really love this song, too.  I esp. enjoyed her performance video, of \"Dark Horse\" on the Grammy Awards, on Sunday, January 26, 2014.3.  \"The Man\"...I wasn't too crazy about this song @ first & I honestly didn't think it would go anywhere. It HAS grown on me a lot & it DID do well on the charts, after all. And I do LIKE this a lot, now.4.  \"Hey Brother\"...I really LOVE this song, too.  It was a perfect follow-up song to Avicii's 2013 song \"Wake Me Up\" (which is STILL on the Top 40 charts) musically & beatwise.  The vocalist Dan Tyminski, a country & blue grass singer, is featured here.  Therefore, \"Hey Brother\" is a dance song w/ a country twang.  And, of course, I think this song IS great.5.  \"Pompeii\"...This song has a good beat & I esp. love the \"HEY O\" parts to this song. I've seen this song performed, in January 2014, on Saturday Night Live.6.  \"Team\"...This has been my FAVORITE song, by Lorde, outside of their other song \"Tennis Court\".  In my honest opinion, \"Team\" is much  better than their previous (BIG) hit, \"Royals\".7.  \"Talk Dirty\"...This song DIDN'T appeal to me too much, either.  However, it also has grown on me & I esp. love the Saxophone parts to this song. It really does make me laugh, every time. I'm STILL surprised to hear that \"BOOTY\" word, as much now, as I did in the SEVENTIES decade.8.  \"SELFIE\"...Unfortunately, THIS song has had a SHORT chart life & has already fallen off the Top 40 charts.  What a shame, because this song is funny, wild & has a dynamite dance beat.  And I love this song, very very much. It definitely has the DANCE CLUB feel to it.9.  \"Turn Down For What\"...Here is another song that I wasn't nuts about, either.  Again, this has grown on me & it's a very POWERFUL song.  And now, I think it's pretty good.10.  \"Show Me\"...This is ALSO off the Top 40 charts. Musically, it reminds me of a SLOW version of the 1993 hit \"Show Me Love\" by Robin S.  This is a good song.11.  \"La La La\"...THIS song really DOES get on my very last nerve. However, it seems to be doing well on the Top 40 Charts. That's all I can say about this song. My LEAST favorite on this ENTIRE compilation.12.  \"Young Girls\"...Off the charts now, too. This song is nice.13.  \"Adore You\"...I was surprised that this song is off the Top 40 charts.  I always thought that this song had potential.  I still like this song a lot, though.14.  \"All Of Me\"...This song had done very very well for itself, even though I wasn't crazy about this, either.  However, it's a NICE song, after all.15.  \"Let Her Go\"...Off the charts now, too.  This vocalist reminds me A LOT of Mike Posner, on his 2010 \"Cooler Than Me\" & few OTHER hits. The string music, on this song,  is quite pretty.16.  \"Best Day Of My Life\"...This hit reminds me of EIGHTIES music, somewhat. I really love this positive & uplifting song  It's fantastic, in every way possible.  And I even love this band's NAME, American Authors.Five FREE Songs From Up & Coming Artists:17.  \"She Keeps Me Warm\"...I feel as though I've heard this song before, I bought this compilation. It's just that familiar, to me.  I like this song, it's pretty good.18.  \"Ten Feet Tall\"...I really LIKE this song, too.  I feel that this song has hit potential & I hope that it makes it.19  \"Youth\"...This song is good.20.  \"Big Talk\"...This is good too.21.  \"On My Mind\"...A good song here & it also seemed as though I've heard this, before I bought this compilation. This song ALSO has a Top 40 hit potential, I think.All & all, this is a decent CD & it contains some of the most CURRENT songs, from the Spring of 2014. However, I wish that 4 OTHER songs were incl., on this CD, such as:\"Animals\" by Martin Garrix, \"Love Me Again\" by John Newman, \"The Monster\" by Eminem feat. Rihanna & also \"Neon Lights\" by Demi Lovato.Otherwise this CD is most definitely recommended.  I didn't get the DELUXE version, because I ALREADY have a lot of those songs, on Disc 2, from previous \"Now That's What I Call Music\" compilations."
A2JHO8NTRLE6LY,B00J5364J4,5.0,ahhhhh....Crissy's back...big time..good music still Crissy....new...new good
AYF76HQ10BL2J,B00J587J9I,4.0,"I do like Revelation more so than Aufheben, but it's probably not as consistent and wears out fast.  Anton doesn't help himself by putting out demos way ahead of the release, by the time the album comes out, you're already over it and have it committed to the larger shuffle rotation of your library.The album is worth it based on &#34;What You Isn't,&#34; &#34;Food For Clouds,&#34; &#34;Nightbird,&#34; &#34;Xibalba,&#34; and &#34;Memory Camp.&#34;  They are sort of throw-back tracks with...guitars and melodies!!!  There's also some modest new creative approaches to old formulas.  I really like all of those tracks, they are definitely some of the best music Anton/BJM have released in years.Tracks such as &#34;Duck and Cover,&#34;  &#34;Second Sighting,&#34; &#34;Fist Full of Bees,&#34; &#34;Uknown,&#34; &#34;Goodbye Butterfly,&#34;  and &#34;Vad Hande Med Dem?&#34; sound like leftovers from  Aufbehen...repetitive, looping fare that are all fine and good, but come-off as filler demo material and none of them are anything notable or memorable, and weren't meant to be...but they make for average, hum drum stuff at this point.I cannot listen to &#34;Memorymix,&#34; it might be the worst BJM song I've ever heard next to the painfully annoying &#34;If I Love You&#34; (and its 3 versions in a row on the album to fill up space)."
A19ODDJW8KHF8G,B00J7UL6V6,4.0,Overall good but a few songs lag and have a feeling if sameness about them.
AB2N7RQW49OMV,B00J7UL6V6,5.0,They are what garage rock & roll are all about.  Right now they are one of the best of the best making this type of music.  If you loved their other albums this one fits in quite nicely.
A3SAOHS7JGYTSJ,B00J7YBR4S,4.0,"This is another really strong recording from Bob Mould, and while it doesn't quite reach the bracing perfection of 2012's Silver Age, it comes darn close and definitely delivers the goods his current trio with Superchunk's drummer Jon Wurster and Verbow bassist Jason Narducy are adept at.Things get off to a relatively measured start with the powerful yet mid-tempo \"Low Season.\" This time around the sheer volume, punch, and musical aggression of Silver Age are exchanged for a more varied collection of tempos and textures. Bits of acoustic guitar and a capella hummed intros keep Beauty & Ruin from being another (albeit superb) guitar monolith. Once again care and attention are given to the interstices and cracks between songs. Layered guitar distortion and echos make tiny soundscapes that string the individual songs together like beads on a continuous chain.When third track \"I Don't Know You Anymore\" fires up, it has an immediate familiarity; it's a very \"Bob Mould\" song from its lyrical DNA to its melodic skin. But if the worst you can say is that Mould writes songs that sound like his own songs, that's not much of a negative to level.I find that as we really get into the mid-section of this album the pace picks up and carries through to the last note. The rhythm section really drives things along, bringing some of the best moments of Sugar and \"Black Sheets Of Rain\" to mind and even upping the tension-and-release. Mould's past experiments with merging electronic sounds and beats into his music often seemed a little timid, and there is no timidity on Beauty & Ruin. Beauty & Ruin sticks to the power trio format to great success. This is a musically assured album that plays to Mould's strengths in an honest and energized way, another fine entry in his solo catalog and a must for long-time fans.Of note is Maggie Fost's nicely executed layout and graphic design, which captures the feel of the old Granary Music packaging and midwestern industrial landscapes with typographic classiness and a couple drops of photographic sensuality. I think Bob may have taken a couple of the shots? He's pictured with a camera on the back cover."
ATB54DUX8BTR9,B00J8JQ6D4,5.0,"Not quite, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Do you enjoy treating your consciousness like a playground?  Do you enjoy both the finer and lower things in life?  Do you like any of the Hanks of the House of Williams?  Do you know where Cafe Coco is?Yes, to any of those?Then you will like this album."
A11YV8Y3CIA8L7,B00J8JQ6D4,4.0,"Sturgill Simpson plays emotional r&b; and blues fused with country elements. To label his music country would be less than accurate, but his recordings are better than most of the manufactured mainstream modern \"country\" music coming out of Nashville. I would rather hear Sturgill Simpson on top 40 country radio than most of the garbage they are playing every hour.Metamodern Sounds in Country Music is enjoyable in its context, although this album is not a country record. This album may not appeal to all fans of traditional country music in the style of well-known artists such as Kitty Wells, Buck Owens, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and George Jones, but that's not the issue. Although Simpson has managed to create a unique style on this record, calling it traditional country could be slightly deceptive.The only problem I have with this record is how music critics have used it as a weapon to defile traditional country music, by making comments such as \"good for country,\" or \"less of a country record and more of a tribute to Ray Charles' Modern Sounds In Country & Western. True, Ray Charles was amazing and he created a timeless body of work which encompassed several genres, especially rhythm and blues. However, Ray Charles never claimed to be a country artist. He was an r&b; singer with southern roots, but one who loved country music. Ray's Modern Sounds In Country Music was not a country album, but featured his r&b; interpretations of popular country and western songs during that time period. I own most of Ray Charles' recordings on both CD and vinyl, so nobody is doubting his importance as an artist.As a longtime fan of country music, I aspire to never be a country music apologist like these pseudo-progressive, worldly music critics. To an extent, it is easy to understand why country music is now associated with certain stigmas, such as false patriotism, corporatism, warmongering, fearmongering, ignorance and racism. Nashville continues to churn out product which combines elements of bonehead 1970s southern rock and hair metal from the 1980s. Modern country music is often sold to these one-dimensional rednecks and zombified lemmings, fueling the pseudo-progressives who feel the need to minimize the importance of country music.Music is a form of art which has the proven potential to break down the barriers associated with a particular culture. However, these same critics fail to read the history books. Legendary country singer Jim Reeves was the #1 best-selling singer in South Africa during the 1960s. Selling albums in the millions and beating other singers such as Elvis Presley, Reeves even recorded several concept albums which he sang in the Afrikaans language. The songs on these groundbreaking albums pertained to the lives and culture of the South African people. Before his untimely death, Reeves also made a motion picture in South Africa, known as Kimberly Jim."
A36IHC0K68NS2,B00J9PSDN8,3.0,"There is something off with the audio on the San Francisco Symphony rendition of &#34;West Side Story.&#34; (I am meticulously avoiding commenting on the performance for which I am immanently unqualified to judge.) Despite any temptation we may have to blame the DSD encoding, it's not the media as I have SACDs that sound much better than this SACD (to my ears.) There is a CD layer (it's a Hybrid.) I suppose I could listen to it. However, I suspect that, in my opinion, it would not differ significantly.Whether it is the mic placement, the microphones themselves, or the recording technique. I can't say. It's not the hall--Davies Symphony Hall does not lack in fine acoustics. However, the recording lacks something. Is it presence? Perhaps. Soundstage? Very possibly. I can say, however, that the sound is no more than okay. It isn't going to make the cut as a demo of my system. It my complement, but certainly will not replace my Columbia Original Cast CD recorded at the incredible CBS 30th Street Studio."
A3PFHVS7V4UZTG,B00J9W0DUW,5.0,"Five years between albums seems a bit much these days, but that seems how it is with IQ.  With this release, the band has delivered another exceptional neo-prog album and well worth the wait.  And I'm not saying that because I love the bands music.  It's just a great release with some great music.  If it was terrible, I would state that fact, plain and simple.  But that isn't the case here.  From the opening track to the more ballad type 'Ocean' to the closeing track 'Until the End' it just delivers.  The second cd of additional tracks is a welcome treat for IQ treats.  If you've been waiting for this release you will not be disappointed.  I think Nicholls has one of those voices that you either like or dislike, much like Geddy Lee from Rush and James LaBrie from Dream Theater.  For me, a great listen and which I am thoroughly enjoying."
A3IQ7ZE7DA3NKN,B00J9W0DUW,3.0,"Good,yet not great. My greatest love is a good prog cd with lots of layers and depth,this one has it,just not to the degree of their prior releases. The new edition to keyboard synthesizers does a great job,however Holmes and Eseu lack and are in the shadow. Another complaint is the drum machine on track 3,totally dated and totally unnecessary for having such a great drummer.All complaints aside,IQ are in top form,just think they could have done a little better on the slow starting songs,some take about 5 minutes to actually kick in. Too much formulaic drum machine sounding A La Phil  Collins, at times. Monotonous drum beats,almost disco sounding, track 5 cd 2."
AUHZ4NEDBKM1X,B00J9W0DUW,5.0,"Fantastic, superb, amazing new  music from IQ.  I recommend that you get the 2 CD edition. Both CDs are full of great IQ music. This band is a prog treasure. Glad to hear Tim back on bass with the band."
A3HFPK3AMDNGBI,B00J9W0DUW,5.0,"I don't have a whole lot to add to the other very articulate reviews about The Road of Bones except that it is one of the finest albums IQ has ever recorded. Now I know there may be some disagreement here but to my ears this is their Piece de resistance. I thought Frequency was going to be near impossible to top but is it possible to rate an album 6 stars?!At times TROB has a definite Genesis feel to it. While I hate to have to compare IQ with anybody I simply cannot avoid the comparison on some of the songs. Mike Holmes does sound a lot like Steve Hackett at times and the new keyboardist Neil Durant definitely emulates Tony Banks on many songs. When Paul Cook hits a cadence not unlike the Phil Collins of old I hear a definite Genesis vibe to many of the songs on TROB. (Although with a bit harder edge.) This is most evident to me on the epic 19 minute \"Without Walls\" and \"Until the End\" on disc 1 and \"Constellations\" on disc 2.Many songs have a \"tried and true\" IQ progressive format with a quiet, even soft beginning then expand to a wonderful full symphonic sound reaching somewhat of a climax and then easing off once again to a softer sound to end the song. However, this format, while sounding formulated is treated quite differently on songs where it is used giving each song its own unique feel.This album is as good as it gets in today's symphonic progressive music. It will have to be a contender for album of the year."
A3M06QSHEVY1DS,B00JAD6DLS,4.0,This is another great album from keb mo I really like it it has some great songs on it would recommend
A1BXDKE6Z21ML7,B00JAD6DLS,5.0,I have been a Keb Mo fan for a while. This CD ranks up there with his best work. I play it a lot when I walk on my I pod. The tunes have you humming them after they are finished. I recommend it for anyone who likes good blues. A must have if you like Keb Mo.
AIJFMQ6M62F16,B00JAD6DLS,2.0,"This album was recorded so pristinely that it completely glossed over a great musician and song writer's talent.  And, Keb Mo, next time use a real bass player on your recordings."
A2BEBJWSK40NME,B00JAD6DLS,5.0,Love this cd! Love Keb Mo!  His music touches my soul and is so powerful and inspiring! Don't pass this one up!
A37KY3JLE565FR,B00JAOW3MA,4.0,"Menzel was better in Wicked; the authors did better in Next to Normal, but this is still very much worth a listen. Menzel deserves her mega-stardom and the supporting cast is very good."
A2KI1SGCZT2OEI,B00JDB4BS4,3.0,"Sorry to be the bearer of VERY bad news, friends, but I am obliged to report that the 2014 remaster of these EMI recordings by Warner is quite decent on three of the discs, while an absolute disaster on the fourth (it's especially painful as I make this report on the 25th anniversary to the day that Karajan was lost to the ages).That fourth disc is CD #3 in the set, which contains Symphonies 4 & 5. I know these recordings very, very well. I have owned the 4th & 5th Symphonies in this set on Angel USA LPs and cassettes, British and German EMI LPs, the initial EMI \"Studio\" CDs and finally, the remaster that EMI did for their 2008 Complete Karajan box set, which I assume was the same master that graced their 2-CD Double Forte issue, which I also owned. All of these versions presented the sound of the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan as I remembered from my encounters with them at Carnegie Hall: warm, blended, colorful, with the ability to crescendo to incredible fortissimos without the sound ever gaining an unpleasant and unnecessary \"edge.\"I ordered this Warner set with the expectation that the sound would basically stay about the same as always, with maybe a slight uptick in the clarity of the inner voices, a smidgen more hall ambience and maybe a little more lifelike quality in the instrumental color.That isn't what we've got here when it comes to the 4th and 5th Symphonies.What we've got is a reimagining of these recordings that would have probably driven Karajan apoplexic. The basic warm and atmospheric quality of these analogue recordings has been jettisoned for an edgy and LOUD presentation that bears no resemblance to the way these recordings always sounded on EMI, and even less resemblance to the way these artists sounded in the concert hall. It's as if the engineers have decided that, \"people think Karajan's recordings are mushy, right? We'll fix that! We'll boost the volume and increase the high partials so every strand of the recording sticks out like a HIP enthusiast's wet dream! We can do it! Now, turn those knobs and dials!!!\"Now, there's an easy fix for what Warner hath wrought: cut your treble gain by about 25% and maybe reduce the volume level while you're at it. With these corrections the CD sounded more like what I remember from its earlier EMI incarnations.The other three discs in the set are fine. The digital recordings included - Symphonies 1, 2 & 6, along with the Karelia Suite and Valse triste - sound about how they did in earlier issues. Maybe there's a bit more clarity to be had, but things are basically the same. The rest of the recordings - En saga, Finlandia, Tapiola and The Swan of Tuonela - feature good, remastered analogue sound, though I found that boosting my volume control brought an unwelcome edge to the sound that wasn't there in any of the earlier EMI versions. Warner offers no indication anywhere as to what recordings in this set are digital and which are analogue, a rather curious omission, to say the least.BTW - I see that Warner is planning on releasing all of these CDs as singles, utilizing the original LP artwork and bearing a sticker price of $26 PER CD (I assume these are SACDs)! I can only imagine what this means: \"here, folks. We've done yet ANOTHER remaster that is better than our budget-issue. Cough up even MORE cash and enjoy!\" Who knows? Maybe they'll take this opportunity to revisit their remaster of 4 & 5.These 5-star performances get knocked down to 3.5 stars for the botched sound offered on Syms 4 & 5 in this Warner set, even though one can enjoy even that particular CD if one does what I did and cuts their treble gain significantly - and maybe fiddles around with god-knows-what-else on their pre-amp.Coulda been a 5-star review, but you can't botch two MAJOR pieces in a set like this and expect not to be called on it."
A3M7HD7GKYPFIU,B00JDB4D3M,5.0,"I'm guessing that a lot of people don't know who Walter Trout is, but I'm telling you, give it a try !!!!"
A2GJXG6JMHBD60,B00JDB4D3M,5.0,"It&#8217;s always a special treat when Boomerocity receives the latest Walter Trout project in the mail.  It was no different when I received my review copy early last month of his new album, &#8220;The Blues Came Callin&#8217;&#8221;.  However, this time the addition of audio bliss into my treasure chest of favorite blues tunes came with a real heavy dose of blues of a different sort.Last year, news broke that Trout was fighting for his life after being diagnosed with a deadly liver disease.  The result was going from a robust look to a skeletal one after losing 100lbs.  This also interfered with plans to celebrate his 25th year as a solo artist.Before Walter received his life-saving liver transplant, his wife, Marie, said, &#8220;For five years, Walter, Provogue Records, and I have worked towards making Walter's 25th year as a solo artist a special celebratory event.  But the festivities will have to wait.  Walter is urgently in need of a liver transplant.  It has been heart-breaking for me to watch Walter struggle through these past many months, as we tried various treatment options provided by Walter's doctors and liver specialists.  One by one the treatments failed.  Yet through it all, Walter's courage and determination continually amazed me.&#8220;Even as he has become a shadow of his former self, after losing 100 pounds and much of his strength, he continued touring, writing, playing, singing and recording.  Music and playing for people offered Walter what it always has: It is therapy and a life-line for him when the Blues comes callin'.  Thus the theme of this album is colored by his confrontation with mortality combined with a deep, all-abiding desire to persevere, and a good dose of typical Walter'esque life-affirming defiance!&#34;Ed van Zijl of Provogue and Mascot Label Group said, &#34;When Walter re-joined Provogue in 2008 we talked about a plan leading up to the 25th Anniversary of his career as a solo artist which is this year, 2014.  Besides a brand new album we also made a book and a documentary to not only to make people aware of the 25th anniversary, but also to have people realize just how good and how important an artist Walter is for the blues rock genre worldwide; a phenomenal guitar player and an even greater person; always speaking from the heart and always in for a good joke.Van Zijl continued on to say, &#8220;The touring set up for 2014 was fantastic with shows at the prestigious North Sea Jazz Festival and the Carre Theater in Amsterdam amongst many other great ones.  Instead of being out there on the road giving his usual all to his many fans night after night, Walter is fighting for his life and there is nothing to celebrate at the moment.  This is so very, very sad and we are all praying for Walter to come out on top.  The album will be released as planned, and Walter definitely wants this one to be heard.  In the meantime our hearts are with Walter and his family.&#34;&#8220;The Blues Came Callin&#8217;&#8221; takes a look at Trout&#8217;s nearly 50 year journey singing and playing the blues.  The album is an unfiltered look into Walter&#8217;s very soul as he contemplates life and his own mortality.Trout said, &#34;To play my music for people has become even more important to me.  When I think about looking out into the crowds of people and connecting with everyone on a soul level, and sharing the experience of music with them, this is what keeps me fighting to get back: My family and my music is my lifeline.  These days, it means more to me than ever before.&#34;Despite Trout&#8217;s ailing health, the album demonstrates a nearly supernatural strength that defied the odds.  &#8220;The Blues Came Callin&#8217;&#8221; was recorded throughout the year last year and offers up twelve tunes &#8211; all but two being Trou originals.  One of the two is a J.B. Lenoir cover and the other is a song written by Trout&#8217;s long-time friend, John Mayall. All twelve songs are blues as blues should be played and as only Walter Trout can play them.Let&#8217;s hope and pray that Walter remains with us for many more years to come so that he can continue to do what he does best: Play us the blues.Boomerocity.com"
A25J05JTCVJI25,B00JDB4DB4,5.0,"Been waiting for a new Eyehategod album for a long, long time.  I was afraid that since it had been so long a new album wouldn't live up to the high expectations of their old stuff.  Their last true full length, Confederacy of Ruined Lives, was a masterpiece of sweat, sludge, and pain.  This album left me feeling strung out and wanting more.  Tracks 2 and 3 are favorites, though I think all of them are amazing.  Can't say enough about this album.  BUY IT!"
A1MTFZYO9E5G6H,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,Michael Jackson is going to be entertaining us for years to come!! God loved him enough to bring him home to his kids in a bad way!! Awesome collection of remastered songs along with the original tracks. Way To Go MJ!!
AX2HNQO24BOXL,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,"If you are a MJ fan, you will love this.  I played it, got to partying in the kitchen, busted a Michael move and limped for 3 days!!  And it was worth it."
A1TKJ3L7FMZ01Y,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,"This album to me is better than the last album Michael.  The Deluxe copy is a must in my opinion.  You get a dvd documentary of the making of Xscape, a poster, 8 new songs, but also you get the additional 8 songs in it's original demo.  The original demo has a true Michael Jackson feel.  Demos of mostly the late 80's to early 2000's.  You can hear recordings with unapologetic tape wobbling to primitive drum machines.  You automatically know that the sound that was once fresh is outdated.  The vocal essence is what keeps the original demos afloat.  Thus different producers come to this project to reproduce these demos with a fresher interpretation.  Here is where I give it a four and a half stars.  Michael Jackson if he was alive would have gone with modern instrumentation and newer beats, cause that was his artistic nature.  Whether this album would have been approved by him I would say more likely no.  I believe the songs that he would've approved are the songs that were reproduced by Rodney Jerkins.  Michael always favored guitar in his music, and Rodney got it right by reproducing it with guitar, and brass, since the whole retro early 80's sound is now in full swing.  I really like the Timbaland  production, but it took some time to accept it, and so is the case with other producers.  Michael Jackson was a dancer and big on beats, and some of these songs are not fully understood in a dancer's light.  Like leaving out a typical eight note hi hat pattern to an early 80's dance beat is hard to get into a dance mode.  At first upon hearing the vocal recording it feels like it's out synch with the energy of the track, but you will get used to it.  The vocal take of Michael is perfect, and you will hear it's intensity, and at times saves the more weaker songs on this album.  I would have liked to hear different and newer producers on this project.  All in all it's a playable album from beginning to end.  Good selected songs.  They songs are catchy, and the melodious ones will make you fall in love with Michael again."
A24N1BAS3CU27H,B00JDB4PEY,4.0,"For Michael Jackson's second posthumous release, lessons appear to have been learned after \"Michael\" was heavily criticised. Songs have been picked which showcase his distinctive vocals, and an attempt has been made to make them sound like \"Michael Jackson\" songs. No rappers attached to songs thankfully.8 songs have been picked (though ardent fans would have heard 6 of them in some form or the other) and sensitively and lovingly worked on by a team of producers including Darkchild, Timbaland and Stargate. One should ideally get the deluxe edition which comprises the 8 touched up songs, the 8 songs as they appeared originally, and a bonus track. This allows one to compare and also decide which version you prefer.Opening is \"Love Never Felt So Good\", a bouncy retro Soul/Disco jam that sounds like it fell off the \"Off The Wall\" album, very \"Rock With You\". The original version is a lovely stripped ballad with just piano and finger snaps backing the exhilarating vocals. The bonus cut is yet another version which is a duet with Justin Timberlake and has a lovely beat box bridge and some extra harmonising. The album's highlight and already a top 20 hit on the Billboard hot 100, his first since \"Butterflies\".\"Chicago\" is a midtempo groove with dramatic strings (the strings remind me of \"Billie Jean\"), while the original is a lilting string-swathed ballad that sounds like it could be from some movie soundtrack. \"Loving You\" is a sweet swaying ballad with hard hitting beats while the original has a soothing feel and softer beats.Rhythmically \"A Place With No Name\" reminds one of \"Leave Me Alone\" or \"The Way You Make Me Feel\", with mysterious story-telling lyrics (borrowed from the America song \"A Horse With No Name\") set to a dark ominous riff and a swinging beat. The original is an acoustic bouncy ballad. \"Slave To The Rhythm\" sounds closer to his latter sound on albums like \"Blood On The Dancefloor\" or \"Invincible\", while the original sounds softer.\"Do You Know Where Your Children Are\" is an ambitious piece with a deep distinctive riff, smidgens of electric guitar, lyrics about a sexually abused girl, (bound to be controversial) and some vocalising reminiscent of \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" as the song ends. The original isn't as rhythmic.\"Blue Gangsta\" sounds sparer than the futuristic original which trumps the reworked version, in my opinion. Closing is the title track \"Xscape\", a funky horn-peppered joint reminiscent of songs like \"Jam\" or \"Dangerous\" with Jackson's vocals alternating between lower growl and upper register. Again, here I prefer the original which  sounds uncluttered and smoother. This was apparently the most recent recording, recorded during the \"Invincible\" sessions.I feel the producers largely captured Jackson's vision, but then that's just my opinion. What can't be denied is that I enjoy it and it makes me want to dance."
A1B621EA66Z8KV,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,"picked up 3 copies and what a solid album by mj!!  i heard 'love never felt so good' on the radio w/justin timberlake..and talk about rewinding the tape back to the late 70s with off the wall!!  also 'xscape', 'loving you' are also really good.  it's just great getting a new mj album with all new songs.  so far, my fave song is 'love never felt so good', we need this song to be a #1 smash!!  the whole album is great!"
A1X0CA0OIWGZ08,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,"The sounds are new and exciting! The songs of love and happiness are catchy and exhilarating and always with a great dance beat! As is common is Michael's songs, children and adolescents will not hear women spoken of in derogatory terms, unlike so many singers today who seem to push cussing and detestable name calling.  However, they will learn about deceptions that occur within relationships and will hear that it is not acceptable behavior.  A great work or art!  I'm very glad I bought the album."
A2AYNWUX1EAGRD,B00JDB4PEY,4.0,"This is a nice recording, but in my opinion the originals are much better than the remixes.  And timberlake has no place on this recording at all"
AMMCC8A920RLO,B00JDB4PEY,5.0,"I am a Michael Jackson fan as many of us are; but I have taken it to a slightly different level with the purchase of his music since his death. I am 75 years  old and started listening to Michael Jackson's music with my children who are about the age he would be were he still alive. When he died, I started a collection of all  things &#34;Michael.&#34; The extent of his music that I owned was a few LPs and, all of the &#34;old school&#34; versions of his music. But, since his death, I now have a very extensive collection of all of his work on CDs, DVDs, News Paper head lines, commemorative magazines, etc.. Xscape  definitely belongs in my collection; and for those of you who don't have it yet, be sure to look at the DVD that comes with it, very interesting way of telling the story of how Xscape came to be by the people who made it happen."
A29WR5DY6X3VJY,B00JDB4PLM,5.0,Great new album!! Has many different sounds on one album spanning aal types of music from rock n roll to country.. Well worth the money!!!
ALND45MWBGUQS,B00JDB4PLM,5.0,"I confess to liking Jack White's music quite a bit. From his days in The White Stripes to side projects and now his solo records it's clear that he's a driven performer and producer who exudes a passion for music. That being said, his music rarely catches me by surprise. By now most of us, regardless of whether you enjoy his output or not, have a good idea of what he does and you either love his noisy, rock-blues sound or you don't. He's a bit of an acquired taste but I like enough of his music to consider myself a fan, even if it often feels like he does variations on the same thing most of the time. I approached Lazaretto expecting some good songs that didn't stray too far from his usual blue print. What I got instead blew me away.Jack is in full-blown country mode here. That's not to say it's a country album but it contains so many Southern touches that it's the closest he's come to fully embracing an old-school Nashville sound on his own. He's played with it before but now it feels fully realized---and the results are excellent. The ballads are perhaps the album's brightest moments, with tracks like \"Entitlement\", \"Want and Able\" and \"I Think I Found the Culprit\" blending traditional country with subtle pop sensibilities. \"Alone in My Home\" is one of the best examples, taking a country flavor and sprinkling it with a poppy hook to straddle the line between old and new. Arguably my favorite track, \"Temporary Ground\", leans further toward folk. Jack throws fiddles into the mix and some female backing vocals round it out into one of the best songs he's penned in quite some time.This is still a Jack White album and his traditional sound does seep in for a few tunes, most notably on the album's title track, the instrumental \"High Ball Stepper\" and the fun \"That Black Bat Licorice\". While White ventures into country, ragtime, blues, folk and rock on this album it still features his trademark vocals and lyrics. It's different and yet won't throw fans who already love his sound. If anything it sounds like the sequel to Get Behind Me Satan, which happens to be my favorite White Stripes release. If you like the softer, more piano-driven side of Jack White then this is certainly up your alley.This record as a very pleasant surprise and it's extremely fun. Even the album cover is appealing (is Jack being protected by angels, leading them, or is it some kind of sly nod to Doctor Who?) and the whole package comes together nicely. It's nothing we haven't heard Jack do before but it is nice to see him embrace a softer sound and go with something a bit less recognizable. As a country troubadour he fares quite well and it's arguably the most consistent record he's recorded to date. Lazaretto is a blast and a must-have for your summer."
A3VA5D5GJPTRLC,B00JDB4PLM,5.0,"i completely love this cd.  once again mr. jack has done things his way and come up with a very unique piece of artistry showing his very vast array of talents in any genre.  i'd say this could put him in the running with some country musicians, although i would never classify him as a country artist.  i'm sure alot of fans don't like the cd but again it just boast his uniqueness and amazing talent.  i would highly recommend this to 'mature' music lovers."
A27D6RT8D7AMPW,B00JDB4PLM,5.0,"Excellent follow-up to his debut &#34;Blunderbuss&#34;.  Jack is a stellar songwriter and musician.  &#34;Lazaretto&#34; offers a wide variety of musical styles, which is nothing new if you like Jack's previous work.  Highly suggest adding this album to your music collection."
A2KUXPRQMR2OET,B00JDB4PLM,5.0,Jack Whites requiem is the thing right now in a good way .its because it contains songs we know done in an awesome way with shrieks.the blues rock n roll and country blues.Honky tonk bitches stand up.this rocks.its nobody's fault that Blind Blake and Blind Willie Mctell spoke the truth in such a powerful way we still can't grasp it.but Jack the Third knows what time it is.the songs are eternal and mostly strong. The vinyl is ultra and full of surprises.i don't know about the CD but would have gotten it.this is pretty much it.from the Bay with love.

ATLO3YXU2BC16,B00JDZK0QC,5.0,"Been waiting a L-O-N-G time.......all 18 albums from The Four Seasons in one place....Add The Christmas Album and the Motown package , and you will have it all from The Four Seasons.For years upon years , only greatest hits packages existed on CD , and finally the &#34;still great&#34; Rhino puts out the originals.Wish at least some liner notes came with the discs , but the music speaks for itself.Beyond the hits is where the treasure lies. The deeper cuts , the obscure cover. Just a great , great vocal band from a bygone era."
ACO8VY7DHBRB5,B00JFBCDD2,5.0,"If you remember those performances, you'll love revisiting these performances. Truly some of the best live takes we've got of this seminal band."
ARM34DLGY5JX1,B00JFBCDD2,5.0,"The 1991 set is anchored by the then newly released Out of Time. Several songs throughout the set were rearranged and/or stripped, and a few of them are much superior to the album versions (\"Endgame\", \"World Leader Pretend\" and \"Fall On Me\"). Unfortunately, they chose to leave some of their upbeat rockers exactly as they are heard on the albums, and it doesn't work in this acoustic setting. Songs like \"Pop Song 89\", \"Get Up\", \"It's the End of the World...\" and \"Radio Song\" are great fun, but they're missing key parts of what makes them so good: distortion and drums. They could have benefited from being reworked or left out of the set in favor of other songs. Surely \"Country Feedback\" or \"11/Untitled\" from Green would have added more depth. Besides that, the Troggs cover (\"Love Is All Around\") is merely decent and the studio outtakes (\"Fretless\", \"Rotary 11\") do not offer much. The rest of the set sounds good for what it is, but I'll probably skip to the aforementioned highlights more often than not.For me, the 2001 set is where it's at. I'm not one of the typical fans that dislikes R.E.M.'s post-New Adventures in Hi-Fi albums. Up and Reveal are the best of them, and they fill most of this set. Even so, the standouts include the bare, piano-based arrangements of \"So. Central Rain\", \"The One I Love\" (dark and haunting) and \"Electrolite\", as well as \"Sad Professor\", \"Country Feedback\" (featuring a nod to Bob Dylan's \"Like a Rolling Stone\") and quite possibly the best song from Reveal, \"I've Been High\". With the exception of the inclusions from the weaker side of Reveal (\"Disappear\", \"Beat a Drum\"), this is close to a perfect set. Listening without skipping anything is best.I'm sure most people will consider this because of the 1991 performance, but I hope the 2001 performance pushes fans closer to Up and Reveal. If you dislike the \"bells and whistles\" from their studio albums--especially starting with Up--then the 2001 performance may surprise you. Both are worth owning, and I recommend them for discovering or reevaluating a large part of their discography from 1989-1991, 1998-2001, along with a handful of other songs, including their early I.R.S. period."
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00JFBCDD2,4.0,"Given that, even in their earliest days, R.E.M. depended heavily on acoustic coloring for their finest material, it's not a surprise that MTV Unplugged would fit them like a glove. These two Unplugged Sessions, which include 11 performances not featured on either of the original broadcasts, offer both empirical evidence that - in both of their decades - R.E.M. could evoke all that was good about indie bands in the 80's on.Split between a 1991 show behind &#34;Out Of Time&#34; and a 2001 show behind &#34;Reveal,&#34; they augmented their sound with guests like Peter Holsapple (the 1991 set in particular) and Scott McCaughey (who played in the pick-up band The Minus Five with Peter Buck). It also showcases how important Mike Mills' harmony vocals were with Michael Stipe's idiosyncratic leads. Given the time between the two sets (long enough to include the R.E.M. post Bill Berry), there's a lot of ground to cover. It actually makes the 2001 disc a more satisfying listen, as they include favorites like &#34;South Central Rain,&#34; &#34;The One That I Love&#34; and the oddness of &#34;Country Feedback&#34; sitting next to songs like &#34;Imitation Of Life&#34; and &#34;Sad Professor,&#34; which are improved in this setting. They also went for the lesser known songs, like &#34;Belong&#34; and &#34;Rotary Eleven&#34; at the expense of some more obvious selections (&#34;Radio Free Europe&#34; doesn't show up on either disc, although &#34;Losing My Religion&#34; made both shows).Fans made distraught by the band's break-up can now content themselves with vintage material such as &#34;Unplugged: The Complete Sessions&#34; and the online clear-out of B-Sides and outtakes for the real devout. However, as dual snapshots in the R.E.M. timeline, &#34;Unplugged: The Complete Sessions&#34; is a feast in a drought. I am willing to bet that there's still more in the vaults that will arrive over time. One can only hope."
A27Z9FV4D0EYHT,B00JFIGFT8,5.0,"I was highly anticipating Mayhem's newest album &#34;Esoteric Warfare&#34;. They're last studio album, &#34;Ordo Ad Chao&#34;,that album was hard to get into and has sat buried by time and dust in my room on a pile of other cd's. Been hopingfor a better album and finally Mayhem have delivered. Enter Esoteric Warfare, their first album in 7 long years.Didn't know what to expect, people on Mayhem's website and Facebook have differing opinions on the new album.When I first heard their single, &#34;Psywar&#34;, instantly I was convinced that Mayhem were back with a vengeance.So, I went ahead and bought the CD and received the Digi-pak version from ImportCd's. So I put the CD in myplayer for the first time and was very impressed by what I heard. Even from the very first listen, I was impressed by thespeed, brutality, awesome vocals by Atilla, song writing, and amazing muscianship by which Mayhem executethroughout the entire album. I have to honestly say that Esoteric Warfare is a more enjoyable listening experiencethan Ordo Ad Chao ever was. The emphasis on speed & brutality is more evident on EW, which I love, althoughthere's still traces of OAC on EW. My favorite tracks on this CD are: Psywar, Trinity, Pandaemon, and Corpse of Care.I would say EW is a cross between OAC and De Mysteriis, with more emhasis on speed and brutality. Definitelya must buy album for all Mayhem fans."

A33LLUCE9FZQCF,B00JGWKKQW,5.0,"Being a long time fan (since the Technocracy EP) I've watched this band....I won't say, evolve, but rather, grow. From a politically charged, angry, Hard Core Punk Band, to a (somewhat) calmer, Metal Band, to Grooved-out Hard Rockers. Eventually spawning, charting albums, and even hit songs, following a deal with Sony Music (much to my chagrin). Here, we see the original line-up: Mike, Woody and Reed, retuning to a place they left a long time ago. Yet, returning as weathered, seasoned and accomplished musicians. This album tells the story of a journey, a journey that has brought these three men, home. Where they tore down the old, Hard Core Punk homestead, but kept its foundation. And on that solid foundation, C.O.C. built this magnificent, soulful, riffy, tasty, Heavy  Rock  Album. The music has a lot of Bluesy, Southern Rock Drawl and swagger. After all, the band is from NC. Yet, whichever way the music sways the rafters, it can never stray too far from the foundation that holds it in place. Think of a Sixties Power-Trio like, Blue Cheer stepping onto the stage of an 80's C.O.C. club show, mid mosh (\"slam-dancing\" in those days), and, viola. I used to think that Pepper Keenan was solely responsible, for the bands excursion into styles unknown. However; when the three remaining members are left to explore on their own, they sure end up in some cool places."

AQOFQWJYJRA5W,B00JH8KJZM,5.0,"A beautiful new collection of songs that defies categorization.  It's a little jazz, a little country, a dash of soul music , a heavy dose of reggae and a side of 80s pop.  This might be a career defining record.  The only true drawback to buying this from Amazon is that you're missing out on the 3 exquisite bonus tracks that are available only from her website, which includes a great cover of Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence."
A1AJCN160HPMI6,B00JHH2140,5.0,"The first i was ever introduced to the legendary Godzilla was in 1998, so I was undoublably a fan of the movie , even until this day Godzilla 1998 remains a pleasure to watch. I watched that movie over and over although I don't remember the film's score , although there is a lot of action music on the soundtrack ,unfortunately i didn't get scared.Now finally we get the reboot we've all been waiting ,and although most would've preferred David Arnold to return to score the reboot instead , we get Alexandre Desplat and I never listened to his music before, but while listening to Godzilla I was blown away, it was so dark and scary , lots and lots of action music to be heard, I haven't stopped listening to it yet. I must admit I do like Godzilla's theme song from the 1998 version , but I absolutely love Alexandre Desplate's theme. the film as well as it's score really harkens back to the eerieness mystery and  fear of the 1954 version , the fact that they actually include the history from the 1954 film is just  wonderful. Director Gareth Edwards brought back what made Godzilla so special while Desplat's music served as the the perfect compliment to the film's stunning Vision ,I really hope he returns for the next film."

A1SX3V4A1EWG1V,B00JJNLZG2,5.0,Been a fan since American Idol.  One of the few people for which I've ever taken the time to vote.  Great voice - great tunes - great second album.
A3I9Q7TS5FQY0W,B00JJP4XKU,5.0,"Since the death of his son, T-Dot has remained somewhat quiet in the world of CHH. Not that I blame him; I've never had to suffer a loss like that. However, Tedashii is a man, and he got up, and began writing music to express this hard period of his life, and boy, what music. I feel like the loss of his son really fueled this project. It raised the passion, emotion to inhumane levels. I don't want to make it sound like we should be happy that such a tragedy happened; we shouldn't, and should continue praying for him. But he really used his pain and his emotions to help create a wonderful album, and we should be grateful that God has allowed him to do that.This album seemed like it would be chock full of dark themes, and though those are present, I was surprised to hear so many bangers. The album has a lot of exciting tracks of what Tedashii does best. He makes you bob your head and bump to the music. I feel like this is him telling listeners that he isn't going to sit in a corner and cry, hoping that everyone feels sorry for him. No, he's going to go harder for god, and celebrate the life of his son. I respect that.He brings in a lot of guests for this one---a good idea, because Tedashii's previous albums tended to be a tad more bland compared to his labelmates. The title track and Perfect start the album on a good note, and Dark Days, Darker Nights is the first standout. Lecrae and Trip Lee join in for another great one, Nothing I Can't Do. Andy Mineo provides a great hook for Catch Me If You Can. Fire Away, Love Never Leaves, Chase, and Complicated are other great ones, but this album has a level of consistency that really impresses me. If I were to rate each song out of 5, no song would do worse than a 3.5, which generally tells you that no songs are actually bad, just ok.And the deluxe tracks are solid as well. One Ten, and Earthquake vie for honors as some of the best tracks on the album.If you like rap, grab this CD, because few albums come along with this kind of sincerity, even in Christian Rap. You ever hear guys in the school halls yelling &#34;Real Talk!&#34; over and over? They don't even know."
AXBUSI1TNCRPE,B00JJWE3Y4,2.0,"I have every Roots release and absolutely love everyone of them. Several CDs are my favorite CDs of all time. This one? Wow, what is this? Is everyone depressed? Did Questlove give away his drum set? Who wrote these tired old, desolate songs? Supremely disappointed. I've listened to it all the way through 3 times and will likely never pick it up again. I guess it's a good thing that some reviewers are pleased. Me, I'll wait for the next release. Maybe they'll feel like partying again."
A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00JKGYSAI,4.0,"Ed Sheeran makes his play  for more mainstream sound on his second major label album \"X\" (multiply). His previous album \"+\" was a singer-songwriter triumph. I thought it was the breakout album of the year. It also established Ed as a bona fide star and an unlikely sex symbol. Yet after that explosion of success, Sheeran decides to mess with the formula. The resulting album is a frustrating mix of sensitive singer-songwriter material and urban hip-hop influences.Ed has a rather thin voice to start with, and when he applies it to wrap he's whiter than Vanilla Ice.this takes up three of \"X's\" twelve songs. While the songs are distraction, they don't totally dilute the quality of the album. It's also worth noting it's also worth noting that \"X\" suffers from multiple producer syndrome, bouncing back and forth  between Jake Gosling and hip-hop icon Pharell. While Gosling handles the more sensitive singer-songwriter material, its Pharell that pushes Sheeran in the more urban direction. Sometimes it works to spectacular effect, as it did on the hit single \"Sing.\" \"Sing\" is a high point on the album.But then again, you're stuck with the rap songs. The worst of these is \"The Man,\" which almost caused me to dock the album by a full star. Not only is the rap annoying, the song is unnecessarily censored. Sheeran, with all the twists and turns he makes on \"X,\" turns sheepish and bleeps a couple of f-bombs and a reference to defecating. If he's so intent on establishing his credibility as both a singer-songwriter and urban contemporary recording artist, then cutting out words that some might find offensive is cheap. You're a good enough singer and a songwriter that you could've easily used different words. Leaving them on the album only to cut them in post-production is not an admirable trait.Overall, \"X\" is a satisfying album. Sheeran is possibly one of the most gifted singer songwriters of the present day, and for whatever flaws this album has, it overcomes them just on the basis of sheer talent. If you're willing to overlook Sheeran's voyages into hip-hop and rap, (\"+\" also explored these elements, but not to the extent that \"X\" does) then you will enjoy this album. If not, then this review serves both purposes of being a warning and an endorsement."
A3P9K04DUYWNP2,B00JKJRGM2,5.0,Uriah Heep can make some great catchy hard rock songs. they could back in the 70's and still do now. There are 4 songs that stand out from the pack. First Speed of Sound gets me going with the keyboard swell and intro riff. the lyrics and melody keep you going long after the song is over. Follow that up with a quasi power ballad in One Minute.Finishing up the album comes with Kiss the Rainbow a dreamy yet heavy anthem. Follow that up with Say Goodby which has a great vocal hook.The other songs The Outsider is a stand out rocker. the rest is good but not that memorable. The Law is probably in my opinion the weakest song on this recording.Overall I would highly recommend this to those who want a good hard rock fix. No over the top metal or excessive high speed guitar just straight ahead heavy rock with memorable songs.
A3DWENW34NQEAV,B00JLKHTCW,5.0,"I saw the movie based on somebody sharing the soundtrack with me.I bought the CD b/c it's actually cheaper than the MP3 collection. Autorip means that you get the MP3 verisons for the cloud player if you buy the CD. It might be slightly different than that collection, but it's still beautiful. Good deal all around.Favorite tracks:Dragon RacingHiccup the Chief/Drago ComingShould I Know You?Flying with MotherThe rest are still beautiful, but they sort of blur one right into another without being distinct enough to make me stop and check the track title.Conclusion: nice collection of movie music with Celtic themes; decent price; buy the CD, enjoy the MP3 and give the cd away as a gift if you like."
A3KO6JEVS1FJ8X,B00JLKHTCW,5.0,"Nice little soundtrack - after &#34;Dragon 1&#34;, was concerned this might be close to the same deal as the prior film's music, but it isn't."
A3O2ZA4F8E8OFD,B00JLXEQ8E,4.0,"This is a nice continuation of the two previous albums albums they did before while throwing in elements from their even earlier work (I'd say barring the early death metal work, though some of the darker aesthetics sort of creep in a bit towards the last half especially with a chilling organ passage). Not necessarily going to top classics like &#34;The Silent Enigma&#34; or &#34;Judgement&#34;, but this is still another strong effort for this really good band."
A3A80EXQ167ZA2,B00JMQ6SDQ,5.0,"I really liked the Greatest Hits part of this but the Ghost of The Download is fantastic ! It really connected to their strenghts and if some of these songs got some air play, they would reach very high on the music charts.  A Rose By Any Name, Mile High, and Sugar On The Side are simply fantastic...... Although I did not really care for Relax, it was not a total bomb. It is one of those re-makes that will grow on you.Hat's off to you Blondie ! Thank You for the music."
A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B00JMQ6SDQ,4.0,"Ghosts of Download marks the fourth recording of new Blondie material since their welcomed reunion in 1999. First was 1999's No Exit, which was recently described by Time magazine as &#34;an album that was plagued by too many ideas, not enough cohesion, a lack of identity, and poorly written material that wanted too much to sound contemporary.&#34; Not counting the brilliant gem, &#34;Maria,&#34; I would have to agree with that description. 2004's The Curse of Blondie was indeed their best of the reunion recordings, unlike their worst being 2011's Panic of Girls. Thankfully, Ghosts of Download does deliver, and almost as good as The Curse did ten years ago. A prime example would be how &#34;Good Boys,&#34; one of the most danceable and Blondie-esque songs on The Curse of Blondie, is just as wonderful and danceable as the present day&#34;Rave,&#34; and by far the best song on Ghosts of Download.What makes Blondie's latest recording more solid is that they didn't have to dig into so much experimentation, which sometimes hurt more than helped them, or perhaps made them more misunderstood. On Ghosts of Download, they are hip with the times, and so hip that they open with the Latin-based &#34;Sugar on the Side,&#34; and then apply their best skills to songs that are layered with modern-day electronica dance and mixing it with the New York pop chic they invented from the beginning. Other prime examples would be &#34;A Rose By Any Name,&#34; &#34;Take Me In the Night,&#34; &#34;Euphoria,&#34; and especially in &#34;Put Some Color On You,&#34;(a bonus track only available on ITunes, but well worth the purchase). Ghosts of Download will provide Blondie fans and the Deb Heads with a breath of fresh air...and just in the nick of time."
A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00JN68LJE,5.0,"Bruce Robison & Kelly Willis\"Our Year\"(Premium Records, 2014). . . .Another fine album from hard country's reigning husband-wife duo... Honestly, I can't tell you how how much I love hearing their voices together (and solo) and of course, the calibre of songwriting and musicianship is always top-notch. In addition to more great Bruce Robison originals, this set features several cool cover tunes, such as Walter Hyatt's homage to Detroit and American car culture, \"Motor City Man,\" and Buddy Mize's weeper, \"Hangin' On.\" The album's most delightful surprise is that the title comes from their cover of an old rock ballad by The Zombies (one of my favorite '60s bands!) and when Willis croons \"This Will Be Our Year\" to a stripped-down country arrangement -- with a banjo and pedal steel taking the place ofthe brass fanfare and dreamy keyboards of the original-- it's a moment of sheer brilliance. Not surprisingly, Willis and Robison have chosen perfect accompanists, with particularly strong contributions from Eamon Mclaughlin on fiddle and mandolin, and Geoff Queen playing dobro and pedal steel.  This is sweet, soulful country traditionalism at its best... Another gem from these unfussy twangcore auteurs. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"

A1GUYU50KQ6TV4,B00JNHR162,5.0,"The third album of the contemporary incarnation of the Swan's shifts slightly from the atmosphere and textures of &#34;The Seer.&#34;  While some there are hints of this in the almost thirty years of the Swan catalog as well as Gira's solo work in The Angels of Light, this album is unique in his discography Relying much more on driving base and haunting incantatory vocals, this album is cohesive and builds musical tension in a more subtle matter than the last two Swans albums.  Like the Seer, this album is long and requires patience, which seems even more daring in an era where the electronic distribution mechanism had made the single even more important.  Yet it is easy to get lose in the two hours worth of music, particularly in songs like &#34;She Loves Us&#34; which is composed with strong internal music movements, layering of textures and vocal tracks propelling you through the song and the album.  This is definitely worth adding to your music collection if you interested in what darker post-punk sounds like now that it is grow-up but is still angry."
A3N4GU3KCOQ0AC,B00JOWHSOQ,5.0,Great music from a great artist.
A4TVX5141Y2TG,B00JOWHTQ8,4.0,"One might argue that when only two of the original four members of The Who are left, that any new recording is not truly The Who. I disagree. The tunes are all by the group and Pete Townsend (the genius behind the group) and Roger Daltry (perhaps the greatest of all rock vocalists) perform admirably--with one exception to be noted later. Quadrophenia is performed in its entirety, with a few new features and jams included. Five other Who classics are offered as well.The boys are supported ably by not only bass and drums, but organ and horns. This adds depth to the music without cluttering it up in an overproduced fashion. The drummer provide the needed energy and finesse, a hard task in light of the memory of Keith Moon (d. 1978), who played on most the bands hits.What is remarkable, besides the tightness of the large group, is the vocal power of Daltry. Yes, his voice is deeper now, but he has really lost no power and little range. I imagine the shirt is now buttoned, but the pipes are in fine shape. No one could match the feel and pathos of Daltry's vocals: pleading, screaming, questioning, strutting. I was nearly in tears at the end of Quadrophenia. The memories of forty years ago were rekindled by a superb and emotional performance.My one complaint is Townsend's performance on &#34;Won't Get Fooled Again.&#34; He seems bored with the tune and plays with it more than he plays it with any conviction. The strong power chords of the original version are often missed, thus robbing likely the best rock and roll song ever of much of its drama and rhythmical  force. The strutting pulsation of the original is all but wiped out. No other instrument can carry that but the guitar. I listened a second time to see if I missed something, but I did not. Pete did."
AWWKZOO8PNYXQ,B00JOWHV3Y,5.0,"This review is for the deluxe 5 disc set.  I also own the 'Director's Cut' that came out last year, and that set really left me wanting.  That was a great package, except for the 5.1 mix DVD-A 'sampler' of tunes from the album.  My two thoughts then were: 1. why bother if you're not going to mix the whole album in 5.1, and 2. I hope that when it does get mixed it's a lot better than those samples.This version of Quadrophenia, as the title states, features a live version performed in 2013 at Wembley.  You get a Blu-Ray, a DVD and audio CDs.  WOW, the band sounds great.  Roger's voice is strong, and Pete is a rhythm power house.  I went to see them perform Quadrophenia in 1997, so I passed on the chance to see them in 2012.  I am now kicking myself big time.  The band is clicking, it's typical Who on a great night.  They start off a little stiff (I mean this is a complex piece to play), but get better and better with each song.  Scott Devours is great on the drums.  Of course he's no Keith Moon, but Keith does appear via film singing &#34;Bell Boy&#34;.  Pino Palladino's bass sounds better on this mix than any other live performances I own.  Of course he's no John Entwistle, but John also appears via film playing the bass solo on &#34;5:15&#34;.It's great to hear a full band performance of &#34;Drowned&#34; again.  The videos playing during the songs have been updated since the 1996-97 tour, there is still a lot of the post-war Britain films, but there are more pictures of the band and a montage near the end that goes up through modern times.  Hard to believe these guys are still this good.So what else do we get with this?  Oh disc number 5...almost forgot.  WOW again.  The 5.1 mix on the Blu-Ray with this exceeded all my expectations.  Rear channels are used by horns and synths a lot in this mix, but also the effects (thunder, ocean, etc.) and occasional vocals appear there.  A lot of John's trebly bass frequencies appear in the center speaker, and they work.  This mix was not hastily done, I can't say enough about how creative and perfect it is.  And as a bonus, you get about 5 minutes of looping pictures from the original album art while the disc plays.The original album was intended to be quadrophonic, so to me, this is the 'real' director's cut.  Disc 5 is the real gem of this whole set."
A1BLYW3MQPOQ9P,B00JOWHV3Y,5.0,"Let's be honest - we're among friends, after all: the studio version of 'Quadrophenia' is the greatest album of the rock era to emerge from the UK.  No need to expand on or justify that claim - it's a fact that anyone with any taste will immediately accept.This version, live in 2013 and consequently missing half of the band that put it all in place, could never hope to match the impact of the original.What it does do, and it does it wonderfully, is celebrate the original - bring out the majesty and excitement and poignancy and spirituality of the original.And Keith singing the funny/sad 'Bell Boy'?  Oh, just buy it."
A9OIEYPCYUZ2X,B00JQHOKSQ,2.0,"To start with,i have been a fan of Ted Nugents since i first heard \"Cat Scratch Fever\" on the radio back in '77 and i love his work from his self titled debut up to \"Scream Dream\". But Uncle Teds music has been very hit or miss since \"Intensities In 10 Cities\" where it seemed like each song on that album was written and rehearsed for about an hour before it was recorded. Stellar playing from all involved but very rudimentary lyrically and structurally. And this album reminds me a lot of that album.Shutup&jam;! starts things off with a promising start and i think that it's probably the best track on here along with \"Never Stop Believing\" and thats about it. It's very good to hear Derek St. Holmes on \"Everything Matters\" as the man has lost nothing vocally over the years. This is probably the third best track but sort of gets bogged down in trying to recreate a \"Hey Baby\" type vibe specifically for Derek. I would have liked to have heard something a little more original for him. Ted wrote all the tunes on this album and he did a decent job here as compared to a lot of the other material,but maybe Derek should have penned his own.And i would have also liked for him to have had at least one more track on here.All of the other tracks suffer in one form or another,whether it's due to silly first grade type lyrics or uninspiring playing from Uncle Ted himself.His backing band however deliver the goods.I would have liked for them to have had stronger material to work with though.But there's no denying the Gibson Byrdland tone and it's prominent throughout this album but missing are some wailing guitar licks from the Nuge.Very disappointing! Also the cover,a rehash of the Free-For-All album, is very uninspiring and lazy.The bottom line for me is that it sounds like it was written and recorded in about a week with very little thought put into it.Ted can and could have done so much better! But the same could be said about every album since \"Intensities\". \"Spirit Of The Wild\" & \"Craveman\" showed a lot of promise but ultimately still fell short of Teds capabilities so this is really no surprise.Live however the Nuge can still bring it with the best of them and i highly recommend the \"Ultralive Ballisticrock\" CD/DVD.Also, if anyone cares about the Best Buy bonus track; it's a pretty fun delightful ditty, but i wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it. Here's hoping once again for something better next time."
A2EWUBAKGPIR53,B00JQHOKSQ,4.0,"Nobody is going to confuse Ted with Jim Morrison on the lyrics but you gotta give the guy credit at 65. He keeps the party goin' with the guitar licks and attitude. Nice to get some new music from the Madman, wish he'd do it more often. Recommended."
A3OYCWEW1TG7WQ,B00JQHOKSQ,5.0,Excellent return of The Nuge.Standout tracks are-1. Fear Itself2. Everything Matters3. She's Gone4. Never Stop Believing5. Throttledown6. I Still BelieveThis album rocks and is a welcome return to form over the last two releases Craveman & Love Grenade not saying those two releases were terrible but Shutup&Jam; is just so much more of what made Ted great in the 70s. Not really a bad track on the whole Album.Inside notes say &#34;The sounds on this recording were generated from specially selected &#34;VINTAGE EQUIPMENT&#34;  And I must say it shows. The sound of this CD has the warmth of Analog which is so much better than the coldness of Digital recordings. Great Release Uncle Ted and looking forward to more of The Motor City Madman for years to come. Long Live The Nuge
A2UYUE1QNMITMQ,B00JQHOKSQ,5.0,"It's clear from most of these reviews that the Nuge haters are out in full force and haven't even listened to the record that they're bashing. \"Shutup&Jam\" is the best Nugent record in years and is a meaty slice of what rock 'n' roll should be: loud guitars, intense vocals (especially with the help from Sammy Hagar on \"She's Gone\"), and unadulterated attitude. Agree with him politically or not, any rational person with ears can appreciate Ted for his legendary musicianship. It's about the music man, so SHUTUP&JAM!"
A1AB8QURAVEC89,B00JQHOKSQ,5.0,This is Nugent!!!! Please do not be mislead by low ratings. Low ratings are from people who cannot look past his hunting or his political views. If you enjoy Nuge's music you will enjoy this release. Take them on Ted!
ANYIK1PR08Q3D,B00JQHON74,1.0,At least they didn't take as long as Boston to make a  dull album. This is as bland as the last Asia album Steve was on. Get Jon back. Heck get Trevor back- either of the Trevors.
A1FQW6BTXMSVMH,B00JQHON74,3.0,"Okay, everyone has a opinion about this album. So it must not be that bad, but it's not that good either. To me the strongest Yeslike track is Believe Again which falls between something like ABWH, Tormato and Keystudio. Jon Anderson must of freaked when he heard this. (If he heard it.) The Game is a good song but lacking depth. It kinda goes along with no kind of dynamics. Step Beyond is definitely a bad song should have been a bonus track for Japanese Edition. Actually sounds like something from the Paris 1979 demos. (Oddly enough from Roy Thomas Baker) To Ascend is really nice quiet piece that sounds like anything Yes has done from its past. In A World Of Our Own has possibilities of being a good song but parts of it are just horrible like the middle section with Downes keyboards grunting like a bad version of Jon Lord. Light of the Ages is interesting piece that Jon Davison gives credibility and has almost a Renaissance (band) style to it. It Was All We Knew is another song that just goes through the motions with no direction. The final track Subway Walls is the nearest thing to a progressive track on the album but even this song lacks power, dynamics and majesty that is known is Yes music. The album overall is very light with some weak lyrics in spots and the band as a whole just seems lost. Alan White(drums) and Chris Squire(bass) just seem like there playing the basics. Geoff Downes has some bright moments on the keys but overall this is his weakest effort. Steve Howe(guitars) hasn't sounded this bad since Tormato. The production is probably the saddest problem about the whole album. Now I know why the Paris sessions didn't work in 1979 because this album would have been that album. I hope Yes in whatever version in the future actually continues to record new music because I believe they have more to say and I hope they don't stop just because this isn't the greatest album. Here is my advice- Make music for your fans and not the singles market. Yes's best music came from songs that were 8 to 10 minutes long or longer."
A3IQ7ZE7DA3NKN,B00JQHON74,5.0,"I'm Believing again in Heaven &Earth;,I just can't get it off my CD player since I got it today. Reminds me of a cross between The Ladder meets Topographic Oceans,truly a masterpiece by a band who knows what prog should sound like. I feel that some reviewers have underestimated the power of the compositions,but there is plenty of vintage Yes found in this cd,just listen to I'm Believing,this is classic Yes at its best. Geoff Downes is sounding more like Wakeman meets Emerson with his keyboard wizardry.The new singer makes you remember a young Jon Anderson at his height. Aa a summation,Yes is a well oiled prog machine that never ceases to amaze.And to further expand,I feel that new blood is necessary in a band in order to keep things fresh,I like the sound the band have evolved into,a deep ambient sound with a non reliance on hard chords to be grandiose in their objective to be progressive. Many have lost the true meaning of progressiveness,it means to do something no one is currently doing and do it in a new innovative way,while keeping true to the fans. I feel that Yes has accomplished their goal here by going against the grain,and as Genesis, prior to them, lost lots of fans,they will gain new ones in the process who are younger and more open minded to change."
A1TVHZSHUAANPO,B00JQHON74,3.0,"Steve Howe: man at work!  Unlike the last two Asia albums with Steve Howe where you could barely hear his playing in the mix, Heaven & Earth OVERFLOWS with Steve Howe licks. Many guitars and textures, it's actually very very pleasant.Similar to the first ASIA album, in that Steve Howe is steering the ship, even if he didn't write some songs, his playing is the best part.It's not 'Classic YES', but it's not as bad as 'Open Your Eyes' or anything with Trevor Rabin.If you love Steve Howe, it's a very nice piece of work.THE INSTRUMENTALS and instrumental sections of songs are worth hearing.  Ignore the vocalist, enjoy Steve Howe.A far cry from any '25th Anniversary celebration' of the great Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe who began July 1989.Or even having any of the grace of YES 'Keys To Ascension' Studio tracks of 1995.96. Still, Steve Howe gives us a lot to hear."

A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00JU3S5KA,5.0,"Old Crow Medicine Show\"Remedy\"(ATO, 2014). . . .Another solid album from Old Crow Medicine Show, who have become old-timey music's equivalent of the Stray Cats, a commercially successful, brand-name version of retro musicmaking and, as time goes by, maybe a bit slicker and more comfortable in that role.  One of the band's co-founders, Willie Watson, has moved on, and perhaps not coincidentally some of their rougher, more truly ragged edges are gone, and the remaining \"kooky,\" unruly touches are plainly self-consciously applied. That doesn't mean that this record isn't still packed with gems, with good, hummable melodies and superb musicianship throughout.OCMS seem to have settled down a bit, concentrating on strong rhythmic and melodic work in a way that reminds me of the Pogues; also interesting is how much the lead vocals have adopted a Loudon Wainwright-ish tone... which is certainly a compliment in my book!  Standout tracks include \"Sweet Amarillo\" (which was co-written with Bob Dylan) and \"Doc's Day,\" a back-porchy homage to the late Doc Watson, and the country-flavored, pedal steel inflected, John Prine-ish \"Dearly Departed Friend.\"  Overall, a strong set of catchy, tuneful neo-jugband Americana... Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
A2A6S9FGQIX5JK,B00JXETVRC,4.0,"Well, I have to eat crow! I was one of the many who were VERY skeptical of JP carrying on without KK Downing. But I was wrong. This album just straight up rocks. No need to dissect each song as many others have done that here. I'll just say that this is, as the band has been saying, classic Judas Priest metal. Sounds sound like they could fit comfortably on 'Defenders' or 'Painkiller' and some even hearken back to some of the classic 1970s records. Faulkner fits in just fine, and I confess that if I didn't know KK was gone I might not even think anything was amiss. The solos are great, riffs are amazing, great drumming as usual since they have had Scott Travis in the band. Halford does not unleash that many of his screams anymore, but he sounds amazing and the screams are great when they come. Lyrically it's still Priest, kind of cheesy and full of clich&eacute;s, but tons of fun. Basically if you like metal, and you like Priest, this will be an essential purchase!"

AGS0UHWMBLX24,B00JXETVRC,5.0,"When I first got this CD I was a bit skeptical, wondering how will Judas Priest sound with the new guy, Ritchie Faulken. As the first song started, I was just trying to get the feel of the sound. Before I knew it, I was slowly but surely taken back to the Priest I always loved and remembered. This is a must have for all Priest fans! This release is like a sonic kaleidoscope off all aspects of their existence, reflecting back on some of their best anthems, complex arrangements, vintage era and modern songs in a whole new exciting way. The guys still have it after all these years, and Ritchie Faulken is now a &#34;bona fide&#34; Guitar God! (in my opinion). He most definitely earned his position to play guitar alongside Glen Tipton. They sound fantastic together! Rob Halford can still deliver incredibly powerful vocals, while Ian Hill and Scott Travis are still incredible masters of their instruments (bass guitar and drums).  &#34;Halls Of Valhalla&#34;, &#34;Sword Of Damocles&#34;,&#34;Battle Cry&#34;, &#34;Secrets Of The Dead&#34;,...I may as well say every song is awesome it its own right! This is pure Heavy Metal that only Judas Priest can deliver. I'm back in love with Judas Priest again, and it feels good."
A15YPJLKLZS0MK,B00JXETVRC,3.0,This is a very heavy album with references to the occult in the lyrics. K.K. Downing has gone and is replaced by Ritchie Faulkner. Priest fans should be pleased. I picked it up at the local Wal Mart.
AT29FDX10O5HN,B00JXETVRC,2.0,"The music is hard, but its not a classic. I'm sorry to write that in my opinion their is not one track that really stands out and grasps you on Redeemer of Souls. They're still rocking and thats good to know. Sorry Judas Priest fans, thats how I feel about it, I think I'll go and turn up Painkiller. All those that gave this cd 5 stars do not know how to rate music because as some mentioned, its boring."
A18DBHHU044QIE,B00JXETVRC,5.0,"I got the Deluxe version and loved it right off the bat. I cant get it out of my cd player in my truck. I wasn't expecting anything this good. it's easily their best album since Painkiller. Some people have been complaining about the sound but, it doesn't bother me. If bad sound on cd kept you from liking an album nobody would like Sad Wings Of Destiny. I thought  KK Downing would be missed but, I was wrong. This kid is better than KK!  Get the deluxe version as you get more songs. Get this album if you like Priest."
A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B00JXETVRC,3.0,"I like this new cd but I don't love it. I bought the \"mega edition\" and that's for not since not one of the bonus songs are really worth hearing imo...I always seem to be disappointed when I ''go big'', I don't know why I keep doing it! Overall the disc starts strong but loses it's way by the time it gets to \"Down in Flames\" and \"Crossfire\". This same thing happened to the new Stryper, it just feels top-loaded with the best and then it meanders after that; Beginning of the End is the exception..the standard cd ends on a decent note with BotE; if you didn't buy the upgraded edition you didn't miss much, all 5 songs imo feel like what they are - leftovers.My fave tracks are Redeemer, Sword of Damocles, and March of. It has what I feel are 10 strong tracks, I have paired down my own version of this and cut off some of the fluff like the first 30 seconds of Hell and Back and the first 16 seconds of Dragonaut..long term I just want the songs to START already!!The packaging and artwork are all top flight, and with the inclusion of the note from the Priest and TWO \"thanks and goodbye\" songs I have to think this is it for them, it's been a fun ride, but uneven over the past 10 years or more. In all honesty I think I preferred \"Angel of Retribution\" but this is a far sight better than Nostradamus. *Notably absent is Halfords patented \"scream\" making many songs feel same-y with lines delivered so monotonically and dryly. 2.5 out 5"
A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00JXZNFP0,4.0,"Willie Nelson's having quite a renaissance. With Sony's Legacy division having broadened their scope from reissues to include new material from heritage artists, Nelson's settled into a surprisingly comfortable home. His turn to classic Americana withCountry MusicandRemember Me, Vol. 1led him back to his longtime home at Columbia (now part of Sony) for 2012'sHeroes, last year's stroll through a set of standards,Let's Face the Music and Danceand a set of duets,To All the Girls. On his latest, Nelson supplements his resurgent vocal and performing talents with a return to songwriting, penning nine new originals for this set of fourteen tracks.At 81, Nelson still sounds remarkably fresh, and the cleverness of his lyrics is (as always) buoyed by deeper truths. The songs include the emotionally penetrating lyrics for which he's renowned, ranging from low-key introspection to the mid-tempo cheek of \"Wives and Girlfriends\" and \"Used to Her.\" Nelson's hiatus from songwriting is the subject of \"Guitar in the Corner,\" but in typical fashion there's more than one layer, as he could just as easily be singing about rekindling an interpersonal relationship as returning to songwriting. The selection of covers include titles by Vince Gill, Shawn Camp and Bill Anderson; the latter's \"The Songwriters\" is an apt selection for an album on which Nelson's own pen has reemerged.Buddy Cannon's production and the hand-picked band (highlighted by Tommy White's steel and Jim \"Moose\" Brown's piano, and featuring the ever-present harmonica of Mickey Raphael) are spot-on, leaving room for Nelson's gut-string guitar and idiosyncratic vocal phrasings. Jamie Johnson is the album's only guest, adding a Waylon-like gravity on a duet of Billy Joe Shaver's \"The Git Go.\" Nelson's artistry is no surprise, but his continued enthusiasm for recording, and his revived interest in writing, is producing unexpected dividends for his many fans.

ADA46LVREUISN,B00K0HDE3I,5.0,I recommend this to anyone who ever listened to and liked any song from this classic hard rock band. the album sounds just as good as their debut Mechanical Resonance. I recently started listening to the older material from the late 80's and early 90's again and this has songs that could fit onto those albums and you would never know there is a 28 year difference in there.

No (thank goodness).  It almost reaches the later high point that became Stone of Sisyphus, their kind-of anti-commercial effort.  This is not ground-breaking music, it's pop music, but it doesn't fit neatly into any genre like rock or jazz, but it is definitely worthy of inclusion into any Chicago fan's library.  And if you aren't a Chicago fan but you came across this by accident - go ahead, give it a try.

If you're familiar with XXX album (and Stone of Sisyphus) then you get a picture.I enjoyed every track in this album. Opened the album with the title track (Now) and I think it is the perfect opening track. Moderate tempo, great horn section intro, beautiful piano, and great melody from Scheff on lead. &#34;If there's a song you wanna sing then sing it now....&#34;, isn't it a great lyric?Every track in Chicago XXXVI has their moment. All three lead vocalists shared their duties. Horn arrangements are well placed, filled in properly. Rhythm and lead guitars are good, drums and bass are great, and most are radio-friendly.I personally don't really like the intro of America. Its the vocal harmony. I prefer it opened directly with guitar. The lyric is interesting. I think it's a critique to the Government, and hoping the country would be better.The energic Free At Last is perfect to be the opening song on stage. I do hope they play newer songs more often. It's not that I don't like hearing old songs. But the last time I saw them in Jakarta in 2013, they didn't play anything after Chicago 17.For those who want to listen to good music with open mind, get this album. You'll love it. I got mine from their official website. To celebrate the 4th of July they offered discount 50% for everything. I got this album and Chicago 16 iphone case."

A1LG11VGFDAFY,B00K57K2JM,3.0,"Like the title says, Jennifer Lopez's new album A.K.A. is decent, but it's not her best effort. I'm glad that she decided to get back into the urban pop sound she is known for, but I think she could have done better lyrically and musically. Most of the songs contain a lot of electronic elements mixed in with her signature urban pop sound and sometimes, it just doesn't blend well. Plus, some of the lyrics in her songs are okay, but there not that good. However, I will commend her on something: her balladry is improving. The four ballads &#34;Never Satisfied&#34;, &#34;Emotions&#34;, &#34;Let It Be Me&#34; and &#34;Same Girl&#34; are pretty darn good than any other ballad she has released in the past. I was thoroughly impressed by them.Here are, in my opinion, the best nine songs on the album:* &#34;Never Satisfied&#34;* &#34;I Luh Ya Papi&#34;* &#34;Acting Like That&#34;* &#34;Emotions&#34;* &#34;Let It Be Me&#34;* &#34;Booty&#34;* &#34;Tens&#34;* &#34;Expertease (Ready, Set, Go)&#34;* &#34;Same Girl&#34;"
ACWD9XZ6I6NB8,B00K57K2JM,5.0,"So I think the album is pretty good with the exception of a few of the slow songs. I still gave it 5 stars because I like her as an artist and she dances her butt off. In my opinion, she is more of a dancer than a singer so her upbeat songs are more fitting for her than the ballad songs. My favorite songs are Acting Like That, First Love, Tens and Worry No More. Overall, not bad and for this to be her 10th album, not bad at all!"
AGAMDS21PJZPK,B00K5P3B1K,4.0,"I was introduced to Joe when I heard \"All The Things (Your Man Won't Do)\" and \"Don't Wanna Be A Player\". The first album that I heard from Joe was \"All That I Am\" and my favorites included \"Good Girls\", \"The Love Scene\", \"Love Don't Make No Sense\", etc.  He released \"My Name Is Joe\" 3 years later in the year 2000. My favorites included the soundtrack jam \"I Wanna Know\", \"Stutter\", \"One Life Stand\", \"So Beautiful\", etc.  Although Joe continued to release records on Jive Records, they weren't able to live up to the commercial success of \"My Name Is Joe\". He released \"Better Days\" a year later, \"And Then...\" in 2003 and his last album with Jive \"Ain't Nothin' Like Me\" in 2007.  His hits on those albums included \"Let's Stay Home Tonight\", \"More & More\", which was originally recorded by R Kelly,  \"Ride Wit U\" w/G Unit, \"If I Was Your Man\" and \"Where You At\" w/Papoose.  Joe released \"Joe Thomas, New Man\" in 2008 & \"Signature\" in 2009 on Universal Records. \"Signature\" had Joe's best collection of songs since \"My Name Is Joe\", in my opinion.  Songs like \"Very Special Friend\", \"Friends Don't Let Friends\", \"Worst Case Scenario\", \"Metaphor\", \"Miss My Baby\", etc. were in heavy rotation for a minute. 2 years later Joe released \"The Good, The Bad & The Sexy\".  Despite the cheesy title, Joe had plenty of good songs on this CD like \"Losing\", \"Dear Joe\", \"Circles\", \"Slow Kisses\", etc.  Last year Joe released \"Doubleback: Evolution Of R&B.;  The lead single was \"I'd Rather Have A Love\" and included other good songs such as \"Sexy\", \"Doubleback\", \"More\" and his duet with Fantasia, \"Love & Sex\".Joe returns in 2014 with \"Bridges\".  This CD does have a R Kelly \"Love Letter\", \"Write Me Back\" feel to it but I'm pretty sure that Joe's fans will be pleased with this effort.  Kelly Rowland lends an assist on \"Love & Sex\" Part 2.  The sequel to the original slow jam ends up being a midtempo song with Kelly & Joe starting where him & Fantasia left off.  \"Dilemma\" has Joe in a situation with 2 women and him trying to make a decision on what to do next.  1 person is going to get hurt and 1 person may or may not be pleased that they are the chosen one and he can lose both of them.  \"Do A Little Dance\" has Joe wanting to take a trip upstairs to handle some business.  I am sure that everyone knows what business I am referring to.  \"If You Lose Her\" has Joe talking about a situation where the man wants things to be his way and not wanting to change anything up.  He's giving a warning to him that if he keeps this up that she'll end up walking out the door.  Then his ways won't matter because he'll end up missing her anyway if she doesn't come back.  The title track has Joe talking about a situation where a relationship/friendship is at a crossroads and on the verge of coming to an end.  He's saying that if you want to leave the situation now, he's fine with it but if she burns the bridge completely then when he wants to come back or if she has a change of heart then it may be too late.Joe is at his best when he is doing slow jams & midtempo songs.  \"Future Teller\" is a good song but you can't help but think that it was left off of R Kelly's \"Write Me Back\".  The only song that you'll never want to listen to again is the \"Mary Jane (Remix)\" featuring 50 Cent.  I'm pretty sure that Rick James wouldn't have signed off on this remake that pales in comparison to the original.  The lyrics aren't the same but once you hear the beat you just start shaking your head.  \"Love Sex Hollywood\", \"Love Undefeated\", \"Take It To The House\" and the other uptempo songs are decent,  I just don't think that those are Joe's best tracks on this album.Overall, it's good to see one of my favorites in R&B; still in the game.  This is a good album and I'm sure that Joe's core audience will be pleased with what they hear for the most part.

A1KWJ1N0LIZQPD,B00K5T1LZ4,5.0,"Believe me when I say this.....the more you play this the more it gets under your skin....sorrowfully beautiful. For my tastes....this is her best yet. Not just pop music.....this is art.I love her voice and the sound of this album.... a wall of beautiful sound. The smoky, slurred, sexy and at the same time vulnerable and doom laden vocals. The musicians get the groove going and keep it going with just the right touch, excellent production. I'm not going to break down every song here but there are many similar themes ....... self destructive characters looking for life and love..... born to lose and born to die......There's some of this in everybody. Psychological and physical pain travels with us all of our days. The desire to find love and peace in another person can be wonderful or it can be hell....or both.....and very few artists convey it as well as this \"Sad Girl\"This is another excellent, artistic album by a uniquely American artist that the critics may never catch up with. She had planned on having Lou Reed on this album but he had an appointment he had to keep.... an appointment we all have and I believe that's what is behind all of the sorrow of Lana Del Rey.... I think it's the vulnerability to psychological pain and the overwhelmingness of life, the beauty and the horror of it all that people are picking up from her. They either get it or they are repelled because of fear. She makes stunning videos to accompany her beautiful music. She is an artistic genius.When I listen to her music I think of the Beat Poets.....Listen to Jack Kerouac, \".......anyway, I wrote this book, because we're all gonna die....in the loneliness of my life, my father dead and my brother dead and my mother........ far away.\"..... That is the reason real artists create, to speak to life and death and God..........\"This is the girl\".....the Real Thing.\"Death Takes a Holiday\"......only in Hollywood.....But you know that, don't you?......Good work, Lana Del Rey."

AVXP4YZNPQY90,B00K5T1LZ4,4.0,"After a week with this album:* It's not as good as Born to Die. It's very good.* I don't really like the production by the Black Keys guy, except on a few songs where it really works. Brooklyn Baby, especially. Still, nice experiment.* The Lana vocal and lyrical mannerisms (at this point, I'm about to call them tics) are in full force here. If they annoyed you before, they still will. The subject matter is the same as the last album.* If you liked the last album, you should get this one. If this were the first LDR album you'd heard, you'd be talking about it like you talked about the last one.Nice job, Lana! While I may not agree with all your artistic choices, you made a lot of interesting artistic choices."
AZCZ5V33I94LR,B00K5T1LZ4,5.0,"Wish I Could Give Ultraviolence 6 stars! This beautifully produced piece of music proves to the haters that Lana Del Rey is a talent to be reckoned with. Ultraviolence plays like a 1970's rock opera. On this latest outing Lana pushes her vocals to the front of the musicand how anyone can deny that she has an exquisite voice is just not listening.  Ultraviolence is dark, haunting and exquisitely beautiful. Lana's songwriting skills continue to amaze.  Her choice of producer on Ultraviolence was brilliant. These dark songsstay in your head leaving a lasting impression of both melancholy and joy.  The enigma of Lana Del Rey is always present throughoutUltraviolence. Standout tracks are ALL of them.  As Lana evolves as a singer and songwriter she continues to amazeand bring great pleasure to her fans. Congratulations Lana on a job well done. Ultraviolence is spectacular! You are truly loved."

A1KFCW9FZOTBW0,B00KCA33E8,5.0,"Very well recorded (ok, I'm biased as I'm friend of the engineer, but being a recording engineer myself, I can honestly say it was VERY well done). High resolution digital multitrack mixed through a board to 1/2&#34; analog at 30 in/sec (right from the engineer's mouth). Sweet mics like an AKG C24 and Neumann U67 were used in various places. Well mastered, if a bit compressed. A good cut, good plating, and good pressing. No stupid effects. Just compression, some EQ, and some reverb with creative pan automation. Uncomplicated sound very well executed. As for the material, itself, I'd give it 4 stars. Several songs we ok, others were great. Not a lot of long jam-outs like they're known for, but they're not too short either. I haven't heard the CD version, but the LP is a win, especially since we live in a time when LP quality is generally the lowest in history (I've heard some pressings from the 50s that sound better than ones today). Funny how that is. Now that we have the ability to computer-control presses with sensors and automation, things were still better 45 years ago. These guys were smarter than to have it pressed at United in Nashville, and smarter than to try to cram it on 1 LP. If you've got more than a passing interest in this band, check out this record."
A2HTF88O2QYO7D,B00KCUY7CU,5.0,"The enigmatic Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler makes a courageous return from the sidelines with her sixth studio album &#8220;1000 Forms Of Fear,&#8221; which follows on 2010&#8242;s &#8220;We Are Born.&#8221; In recent years, she avoided the limelight deliberately, but behind the scenes she was responsible for a number of huge hits. For example, songs from Sia Furler could be found on albums by Katy Perry (Prism), Britney Spears (Britney Jean), Beyonce (Beyonce), Kylie Minogue (Kiss Me Once), Shakira (Shakira) and Jennifer Lopez (AKA). Some of those big hits were Rihanna&#8217;s &#8220;Diamonds,&#8221; David Guetta&#8217;s &#8220;Titanium&#8221; and Ne-Yo's &#34;Let Me Love You&#34; to name just of few.The Sia-signature - like the vocal dips and mid-tempo melancholy of &#34;Diamonds&#34; - that the now 39-year-old singer and songwriter stamped on those hits, can be found once again on this album. Songs like &#8220;Burn The Pages,&#8221; &#8220;Straight For The Knife,&#8221; &#8220;Hostage&#8221; and &#8220;Big Girls Cry&#8221; sound as if they were intended, respectively, for Katy Perry, Lana Del Rey, Shakira or Rihanna. Furler wrote most of these songs with Greg Kurstin, who produced this album and also worked on recent albums by Lily Allen, Lykke Li, Tegan & Sara and Pink. This collaboration provides for a dozen irresistible pop melodies, although Furler&#8217;s reluctance to promote this album - she does minimal press and refuses to be photographed - might be the only obstacle for global success, although her impressive vocal acrobatics should do the work for her.What struck me the most about &#8220;1000 Forms Of Fear,&#8221; is that how this sublime record is a personal victory for the once addicted and suicidal singer. Just really listed to the song &#8220;Chandelier,&#8221; which sounds like a pop anthem, but take note of the darkness at its center, with lyrics like &#8220;Help me, I&#8217;m holding on for dear life&#8221; and &#8220;&#8220;Sun is up, I&#8217;m a mess.&#8221; Sia rejected fame and retreated from public view, which allowed her to find her true self, and now experiences a triumphant comeback. The militant &#8220;Dressed In Black&#8221; and understated &#8220;Cellophane&#8221; are main examples of this and also the songs in which she excels vocally. You may not be able to see what Sia looks like on the cover of her album - besides the singer&#8217;s signature haircut, a blonde bob with blunt bangs - but she sure sounds like a superstar."
A3K2J86VI3TJV3,B00KCUY7CU,5.0,"Sia has had an unconventional trajectory; diagnosed with Graves disease, boyfriend killed in a car accident, addiction to drugs and alcohol, attempted suicide. Plus, she hates fame so much that she poses with a paper bag over her head, and performs with her back facing audiences. Responsible for a plethora of international pop smashers for some of pop's biggest names, and while working on many other projects, there was still time to produce an own record. As the title and cover art might reveal, Sia goes back to her darker side for this, her 6th studio album, spiralling into destructive depths of weakness, vulnerability, desperation and struggles, all returning points for her.Longtime fans know what to expect from her, new followers are probably curious to learn about the person behind the colossal hits. Perhaps all too aware of what the public wants from her, Sia gives the public exactly what they want. She offers strong and well produced pop ballads, some uptempo tracks, and the occasional slower numbers, all accompanied with her unique and always impressive voice, the sound of someone singing for their life. She is dabbling with pop, experimenting once again with indie pop, electronica, acid jazz, soul, dance, and trip-hop. Produced by Lily Allen's former collaborator Greg Kurstin, they have sculpted a beautiful masterpiece of an album.Her enrapturing talent and torment shines throughout &#34;1000 Forms of fear&#34;'s 49 minutes. Very often I found myself paying more attention to the lyric metaphors and the dramatic vocals, rather than enjoying the songs. Sia has a certain vibe in her music which, although it cannot be missed, it tends to overshadow the sonic excellence of this album. First single, &#34;Chandelier&#34; is indicative: a gorgeously reggae-electronica fused number about a never ending party life, with Sia's titanic voice bursting open the chorus like a cannonball; a closer reading between the lines makes clear that it is a song about alcoholism. It is obvious that the artist writes genius texts, this is her biggest talent, combined with her distinctive voice.Built around sterling melodies, standouts &#34;Big girls cry&#34;, &#34;Straight to the knife&#34;, &#34;Elastic heart&#34;, &#34;Fire meet gasoline, &#34;Cellophane&#34;, and &#34;Dressed in black&#34;, convey emotion that is unmatched by most, if not all, other contemporary artists. Despite her personal hardship, Sia is able to produce exceptional power balladry and intelligent lyricism. &#34;1000 Forms of fear&#34; rings true to its dramatic title. It is a consistent, brilliant, deep pop record, by one of pop's best artists. After producing so many hits over the years, perhaps one's fear would be Sia's transformation into an mainstream artist. As long as she insists on performing wearing that paper back on her head, there is absolutely no fear of that happening."
ANZKBHR1MD7JC,B00KCUY7CU,4.0,"Sia's new effort \"1000 Forms of Fear\" may not be groundbreaking or novel given her discography but it delivers more than what any pop album these days is typically supposed to offer. The new album is a cross between \"Some People Have Real Problems\" and \"We're Born\" capitalizing on the somber and emotional moments of the former and the joyous and exuberant moments of the latter. Songs such as \"Burn the Pages\" and \"Hostage\" picks up from where \"We're Born\" left off and sound like the natural next steps in Sia's music direction. But the new album reveals its stronger tricks among its slower moments. \"Big Girls Cry\", \"Straight to The Knife\" and \"Eye of The Needle\" are heartfelt, raw, and lyrically poignant. Right on these songs, Sia's voice shows its strength by vacillating between clear notes to vague sounds in order to communicate her emotional journey. ''Elastic Heart'' is probably the best Sia song ever with its examplary chaotic combination. What makes \"1000 Forms of Fear\" a stellar pop record is that it remains dark even in its relatively more lighthearted songs (e.g.,\"Fire Meets Gasoline\"). The album indeed doesn't have a single dull moment and all of the songs have the potential to hit the airwaves. Sadly, this last point is also what precludes Sia's latest effort to be a masterpiece. The album plays too safe and it feels rather incomplete and restrained. Sia doesn't hold back to write about her feelings but this time around, she sounds almost too vulnerable and fragile to let her listeners in. Instead of going experimental on her uniqueness, she stands distant and detached and hesitates to provide the full range of emotions she is going through. If only the album featured more tracks like \"Dressed in Black\" and \"Fair Game\" but even at her most conservative and reserved version, Sia manages to pull of a strong pop album and remains as one of the most prolific and intriguing pop artists around."
AGT8QJPCQUPSK,B00KCUY7CU,5.0,"As soon as i heard Chandelier, i was instantly hooked. This song was like something Sia had never done before. It was a powerhouse song that was her own work. It is amazing. I can not stop listening to this album. This album is beautiful. I listen to this album all the way through every time. You can really see Sia's growth through this album, with two sides: Pain and Joy. This album is a lot more different compared to her other records, but i absolutely love it! I bought this album the day it came out and i am so pleased with it. You can not go wrong with Sia, or this album! If you love Chandelier, you will love this album!

A1YCK9VVFC0RBC,B00KDHSNV8,2.0,"There comes a point where an artist starts making more for himself than the fans that may be left that will still buy it. I feel Richard Marx has now reached that point. A few of the songs are pretty but overall these songs sound like something that have been done before (and much better) long before. I think Richard still has songwriting ability, but he just won't break out of the box.  I think he should have stuck making songs for other artists where there is more on the line.  I just think he feels his solo career really doesn't matter that much anymore and he can just use it as a platform to put out the same boring formula again and again!  I did not buy this CD, I heard it on Grooveshark in it's entirety and for the first time I will not be buying one of his CD's or adding it to my Marx library.  I started to get this feeling with Emotional Remains and Sundown which I play the least of all his albums.  But honestly, I don't want to hear any of these new songs ever again.  His best days are long behind him, he needs some new inspiration.  I think writing new songs for another artist might be the thing to do, maybe even a newer artist!"
A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B00KDKM58C,5.0,"I have no idea what it is about those songs of the 60&#8217;s and &#8216;70&#8217;s, except that they remain in your memory and are a part of your DNA.  I suspect that many who attended the movie came because of the music, which is the highlight of the film.The soundtrack and motion picture is based off the Tony Award Winning Jersey Boys, with three of the stage stars reprising their role in the film version. John Lloyd Young, who plays Frankie Valli, is fantastic. He won the 2006 Tony Award Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. He carries that talent and performance well onto the screen, frankly making the movie a show stopper. The others in the cast who played members of the band were no less talented, and this CD is filled with fantastic music.&#34;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&#34; was undoubtedly my favorite for entertainment value. Anyway, if you saw the movie and want the music to continue, this is a great listen."

A15BSHYHVEBX3T,B00KE7PBH6,5.0,"I saw Ginger live in Boston last night performing this CD (I even purchased a signed copy)!! This is arguable the best Ginger Baker out there (including his playing in that quaint little three piece he played with during the '60s - no, I am not speaking of the graham Bond organization - a four piece). This time out  Ginger has a four piece, himself on drums, an African percussionist, double bass/fender bass player and sax. The music is like Coltrane's Love Supreme era plus wads of percussion. This CD was beautifully recorded, not loud in volume, but full of presence. You can hear each instrument clearly, which, in this case is great, because you get to enjoy all the polyrhythmic interplay between the two percussionists. I had seen Ginger with Cream but this group is much, much, more his true setting. There were points when the beat was turned around every other measure, a feat mesmerizing to witness. The guy still has it after all these years. At the concert, Ginger was, thankfully, his gracious, cranky self - LOL!! His health is now taking a toll on him, just performing becoming a real labor. However, when he gets on that kit, the years seem to wasj away. Enjoy him while he is still with us. Pick up this CD because it is one of the best of his career!!"
A2LHZLHJJU1TO4,B00KF1CWF0,5.0,"For a short period in time, yes.  Their star quality had not been approached by any other group in the early to mid-seventies.  Their influence on the direction of folk rock remains unquestioned.  If you are a fan of the group, which by the way, they sound more like a group here then at any other time, then this boxed set is a must own.  What makes this special for me is the number of songs that are given the full band treatment, ones that were either released without the full quartet on solo and duo albums or songs that have not seen the light of day until now.  There is no need to go into the over-indulgences of the band on tour as it is not important to the listener.  Yes, there is some sloppy stuff here (you can tell that Stephen Stills was pretty wasted by his singing) but playing in huge outdoor stadiums no one sounds at their best, especially a folk rock group.  What is sacrificed, however, in vocal precision is made up for with an amazing amount of energy and enthusiasm on everyone's part.  Whether it was drugs, alcohol or egotism, it's such a pity that there was not enough maturity and loyalty present to sustain the group beyond these tour dates."
A2UK2ZTPZQLEAL,B00KF1CWF0,5.0,"If you love CSNY, you simply *must* buy this box set! These live recordings of CSNY at their prime is thrilling from beginning of the first disc to end of the third. You also get a bonus DVD that has eight live songs on it. Not only do the three CDs contain the hits you expect, but also contain several songs that have never been released before. This box set also contains a very thick (thus lengthy) book, which contains a lot of great photos and interesting text. This is the best thing I've purchased so far in 2014."
A1HKFTXTG25YLW,B00KF1CWF0,5.0,"I haven't had the time to listen real closely through this set, but I haven't heard anything that doesn't sound good, and all four are in real good voice. I've been playing it pretty much non-stop, and it keeps unfolding for me. It seems like they had decided that the motto of these concerts was to &#34;make it new.&#34; And that makes this set a continual pleasure. Neil Young's &#34;On the Beach&#34; takes the stoned studio version up a few notches &#8230; no, check that &#8230; it takes it to a whole new level. And it's great to hear this live version of &#34;Revolution Blues.&#34; I thought the song freaked out David Crosby, so I was surprised to see it here, and it brings back that brief moment when Charles Manson crossed paths with Neil Young. Whew. It's still a scary song. &#34;The Lee Shore&#34; is always beautiful, and this version takes me to the Caribbean, and that floating feeling of yearning for that place of freedom and beauty. Graham Nash brings an edge to &#34;Immigration Man&#34; I haven't heard before that made me listen to the song with new appreciation, and I was wishing that they'd included &#34;I Used to Be a King&#34; though I don't know if it was written by this time (I love these guys, but I haven't been a devotee of all their permutations and combinations). Even Nash's take on &#34;Our House,&#34; a song I never cared for, feels like it has more substance. That's the case with a good number of the songs on this set. I even like &#34;Almost Cut My Hair&#34; for the more thoughtful way it comes across here. It just never seemed like a topic that could support the drama David Crosby imposed on it (and yes, I was around when the &#34;freak flag&#34; did seem to matter). Still, it felt like he was making a big deal out of a lousy haircut. But here the song has a bit more weight, maybe because it doesn't come on as heavy as the studio version. I know a lot of folks really like this tune, it just never connected for me very strongly, but I do like it here. There's so much on this set to discover, and I think that's my main point - it's a lot of fun to hear them playing and singing so well, without slavish devotion to reproducing the studio versions of songs. But I'm someone who enjoys the risk and discovery that can happen on live albums, and I'm not much concerned with high fidelity. Besides, the sound is very good throughout. I was thinking with &#34;CSNY 1974&#34; I might be buying a longer version of &#34;Four Way Street,&#34; and that was okay, but this really is so much more. Along with Dylan's &#34;Another Self Portrait,&#34; this set is at the top of my list of archival releases."
A3BXZ1EXCSCCSY,B00KF1CWF0,4.0,"I will start with the fact that I was at the Day on Green Oakland concert, The Band, Joe Walsh, CSNY, others ? cant remember. Can't remember if it was July 13 or 14. Have only slight memory of Joe Walsh. Dropping acid and drinking beer in the sunshine plus 40 years leaves me with no memory of this concert.This is a good purchase for me. I chose the Blu Ray Audio, one disc and the DVD. Stereo (Left/Right-sub) is the preferred way with this recording. I did listen to in 5.1 but in my opinion it actually took away from the greater stereo sound.The DVD is more historical than great video watching of CSNY.The package and small book is what pulls the two discs together. The booklet is best read as a PDF on computer. The photos are fantastic, especially those of CSNY rehearsing at Young's property. The reading is great and really brought me into the entire 1974 concert schedule with band members, logistics, reviews, etc. Nice info on Bill Graham.Overall I gave 4 stars just because some of the songs are a little weak, and I am more of a fan of electric guitar music where these recorded acoustic sets are a little weak for me. I very much like the fact that many of the four band members used there own solo songs.Glad I have this new set of recordings in my library."
A17KQ9DMZ2XZ6J,B00KF1CWF0,5.0,"This is the album I was hoping would have been released in 1975. It is well worth the wait. My only quibble is that I want more! I want Carry On, Sugar Mountain, Human Highway, Another Sleep Song, It's Alright and all the other songs performed on the 1974 tour."
A9Q28YTLYREO7,B00KINIPI8,2.0,"didn't really feel much from hearing this album.i respect Mary J Bliege and she has had quite the career, however between that corny christmas album and this album, i just feel something is missing and she can do better in her sleep. problem is nobody can take her where she longs to be and that is to be on that top tier mountain of the baddest female Artists ever. she is in a lane, however she hasn' taken that leap as she seemed destined for back in the 90's when she could almost do no wrong as a artist. this  album feels so safe and predictable it ain't even funny."
A2GM883SM9R942,B00KLSSKA8,4.0,"On the heels of Someday World, comes High Life, what Brian Eno described as further material inspired during the former's work sessions. Of the two new releases, this one is superior. Not that Someday World was anything less than 5 stars itself, the material on this album goes beyond \"just another Brian Eno release\" with its longer pieces, giving time to develop into some pretty rousing musical moments. Eno's vocal work here is as good as it gets while the music would stand on its own if these tracks were presented as instrumentals. Additionally, this album features Karl Hyde's contributions to far greater advantage with some excellent ascending guitar work not as obvious on Someday World.Another plus is that unlike Someday World, there is no \"deluxe\" edition where the cost is twice as high for a so-called bonus disc. The 1/4 hour bonus disc for that album, in tandem with 3/4 hour regular disc totaled to less than an hour. Seems like Mr. Eno inflates prices with this \"1 album for the price of 2\" tactic frequently these days. Consider one his best releases of the past decade, \"Small Craft On A Milk Sea\" ...a particularly onerous example where one had to spend a 3-digit figure for the 4 bonus track CD only available if you purchased the vinyl edition! What if I don't have a turntable? Why must I buy records to get a bonus compact disc? The vinyl version of High Life also has a track not found anywhere else, On A Grey Day. So again, how many times must I buy this title in how many different formats to get the entire, under one hour album? Answer: 3 (the CD, the MP3 download or the expensive Japanese import, and the vinyl version). Ugh!As always, the Japanese version of High Life has a literal bonus track: Slow Down, Sit Down And Breathe. This track has not been added at the end as a simple outtake, but rather is track 6 of 7, indicating it probably is an integral part of the whole. I wonder why Japanese listeners always get a longer and better album than do western fans. Slow Down, Sit Down And Breathe is also available as a so-called \"Digital Bonus Track\" ...an MP3 download from Amazon, costing an additional $0.99. If you have to pay for it, it is NOT a bonus. As a result, I gave this 5 star album 4 stars, having to burn it to a CDR in order to include Slow Down, Sit Down And Breathe where it belongs as track 6.MR. ENO: Please stop spreading so-called bonus tracks all over the planet while nickel and diming your completist fans like this. Why not just set the price a little higher to begin with and keep all of the album tracks on just one disc? Downloading illegal torrents is something I never do since it the same as stealing from the artists. That said, if there is an EP forthcoming with more so-called \"bonus tracks\" (that would have easily fit on this 43 minute CD), I'll be hard pressed not to get it that way ...and I will lower my rating for this album to 3 stars. My review for High Life was originally 5 stars when I first wrote it, but I lowered it to 4 stars when I learned it was missing 2 tracks (so far)."
A2NHIWHCZP5JRF,B00KPHL7K0,1.0,"Zzzzzz.  Same old songs, albeit with a fairly fugacious band line-up."

A2SE84FK9NZ6P5,B00KTS9ZFY,1.0,"Well, Well, Well, Look who has come out with an album that faithfully and lovingly states: I'M CRAZY!Ya know how it is when we hear about celebrity spats and someone says, \"Boy, I would like to be a fly on the wall in that house.\" Holy S-it, I don't want that anymore!!!!Listening to this album was like being in the middle of a gum enamel disaster with the Hookers from Hunts Point(old HBO documentary  - Hookers On The Point - for Robin, it's a classic) - listening to obsession, psychosis, intimacy (but in a disgusting p-o-r-n between two crazy folks across-the-street in an alleyway kind of way), and maniacal depression. This just feels all kinds of out there - Joker/Jekyll and Hyde/Pee Wee Hermann/I'm-gonna-kill-you-kind of out there.As much as you want to step away from the drama and listen to the music, you simply can't. He has beaten the context and the meaning and the PROBLEMS that caused the existence of this album over our heads OVER and OVER and OVER again, that you simply just can't get away from it, You'll be searching for the meaning of the lyrics as they pertain to his personal life (those that say they are disciplined enough that they didn't do this - well, they lie to their lovers too). POW!!!!. Thing is - he really doesn't try to veil it in any kind of creative way. It's pretty much:I'm the most disgusting guy you will ever meet, I can't help but resolving all my issues with sex, and Paula, I love you so much that  all I want to do is jump your bones. Ain't that sh't love??? Now come back here and lets role play.Looking back at all his albums, I'm wondering. did this dude pop a couple of Viagra's and have an erection for TWELVE GOD DAMN YEARS???? Must be sore, shriveled and grimy. I've just realized how sexx-driven this guy is. Benny Hill got nothing on him.I don't know but if I saw Robin Thicke in an alley at night, I'd probably go running, flailing my hands up in the air, losing my purse in the process, looking for scissors somewhere to cut a certain something somewhere. That's just me.As I listen to this album, for some inexplicable reason I end up thinking about weird scary carnivals or Tim Burton's Gotham City.  Those 50's sounding songs don't help either. Just too much of a crazed killer aspect to all this. Feels like a man trapped with 50 other personalities in his body. Including a cross-dressing one. You just KNOW there's one in there somewhere.By the end of this album, I felt as if a couple of neighbors invited me to dinner. Midway through dinner, they screwed each other on the table. As they did their business he snorted and injected all kinds of impurities into his azz. Then, the midgets - I mean, the little people - came in and he screwed all of them to her horror. Pots, Plates, syringes all went flying crashing on the wall as they argued. Then he put on a dress and makeup and sang as she packed. Finally, as she bolts out the door, he's in the kitchen in the buff and he grabs a pair of steak knives and sharpens them - and is strangely aroused.That's how disjointed, haphazard, stone crazy, thrown together this album feels.Basically, I was violated listening to this album.."
A1RNSJIOGBUYCC,B00KTS9ZFY,4.0,"I have honestly never liked Robin Thicke one bit.  I always thought he was a cheap rip off of Justin Timberlake.  I remember when the video for \"Blurred Lines\" first came out and was starting to generate attention.  It was his lucky year in 2013.  If it wasn't for the controversial video and annoyingly catchy song, he wouldn't have reached number one.  I admit the song is catchy, but I still don't like it.  Well then Paula Patton, his wife, separated from Robin and ever since he has been pleading for her at concerts.  Then he goes and does something like this.  It does seem pathetic and creepy as seen from the first single \"Get Her Back\" and it's equally creepy video.  Everyone assumed it was all just a way for Robin to sell his new album written about and titled for his wife.  Too bad it didn't work.  People don't seem to be buying it, and they aren't giving the music a chance since all people can think about is that he is a creepy guy taking advantage of his fame.  I was one of those people.  Dismissing the album automatically as a stalker creepfest soundtrack without even listening.  But....then.....I listened to the album.  I have to say a lot of the songs are very well put together.  The lyrics can be too corny but also sweet to listen to while thinking of your lover.  He has put out a more laid back love album.  The production is crisp on each track.  My favorite tracks are \"Get Her Back(Without the video)\", \"Lock The Door(Even if its very creepy)\", \"Love Can Grow Back\", \"Too Little Too Late\", \"Opposite Of Me\" and \"Black Tar Cloud\".  I think if you forget the dumb drama this album was made for as a cash grab and just listen to the music, you might find something you like.  I'm not proud of it, but I actually enjoyed this album.  Remember, just forget that he's a creep and sit back and listen.  I'm sure with time this album will be considered very underrated after people forget about the drama.  There are no \"Blurred Lines\" type songs on here, and thats a great thing.  I personally don't care whether Robin and his wife reconcile.  I'm just a music lover, and this is decent new music."
A288SXRFQA42XE,B00KTS9ZFY,5.0,Wow this is my Robin Thicke album and I can honest say he has hit a home run with this album at least for me. It's very enjoyable album and for all he people who said bad things about this album they are looking into the album to much. Just let the music for itself without thinking about his personal life. I am very greatfull for this album because it's my summer album.
A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00L326LTI,5.0,"If ever the world needed \"Weird Al\", it's now. Al is back to cut through the bleak harshness that the world has become and to make it laugh once again. Let's hope this isn't the last \"Weird Al\" album. He is really on top of his game here.The album opens with \"Handy\", a spoof of Iggy Azalea's \"Freaky\". Quite honestly, I had never heard of this person until this album. I've never heard of (or heard) the song. It's a decent number with Al singing about his handy carpentry skills. \"Lame Claim To Fame\" is not top notch Al. He sings about all the ways he is connected to certain celebrities. It sounds like something he could knock off his sleep and could of appeared on any of his last albums. \"Foil\" is a wonderful parody of Lorde's \"Royals\", and judging by the title, it's clear what it's about. Howver, it's not all just about keeping your food fresh. An album highlight. \"Sports Song\" is a fun, high enery song that seems to incorporate all the sports anthem cliches. A top drawer track. One of the best songs here, and one of Weird Al's best parodies in years, is \"Word Crimes\", his take on Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines'. Here, Al sings about proper usage of grammar and it's pure gold. The hard rocking \"My Own Eyes\" is a solid rock song, but it doesn't really do it for me. His pola medleys are expected and \"NOW That's What I Call Polka!\" delivers as they always do. Another standout is his parody of Imagine Dragon's \"Radioactive\". Here, it's called \"Inactive\". It's a hilarious and well done song about one letting themselves go. \"Tacky\" is one of Weird Al's best. A parody of Pharrell Williams' \"Happy\" that has Al singing of all the ways one could be tacky in this day and age. \"First World Problems\" is a catchy rock tune about all the ridiculous things people whine and complain about today. If there were any real duds here, it would be the CSN inspired \"Mission Statement\". His final song, the sprawling \"Jackson Park Express\", isn't as good or funny as his other long songs he's had on albums lately, but it's not bad.\"Mandatory Fun\" is classic Al. It's a showcase for an artist who has stood the test of time and stayed relevant. Al can stay cool by parodying the songs of the day, but can also do any music he wants, in any style he wants, with his original stuff. He is singing better than ever. It's amazing. After 30 plus years, Al finds himself in a weird era where anyone can post something to You Tube or make up a song and put it online. Al can still outdo everyone with ideas and sounds that only he can do. My first album of his was \"Even Worse\" in 1988, and the joy he has brought to me and millions of others is undeniable. \"Weird Al\" will still be here years from now when a lot of the pop stars of today won't be. He is still as sharp and clever not only in his ideas for a parody, but in his lyrics and a lot of the words he uses and the way in which he uses them.Let's hope this is not the last traditional album from Al. It makes me sad to think this could be the last of anything from Al that I can own. Al needs to continue to bring the funny because we need the laughs now more than ever."
AQ5C6BL4WANAY,B00L326LTI,5.0,"What can I say? It's Weird Al and he's still got it after all these years. As usual his originals and pastiches are a bit hit and miss. Lame Claim to Fame, First World Problems and My Own Eyes are meh. But Sports Song is awesome and Mission Statement -- a pastiche done in the style of Crosby, Stills, and Nash -- is just brilliant. The polka medley is fun as always and all four of his parodies are great."
